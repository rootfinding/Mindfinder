S09E08 Rachels Other Sister.txt,Chandler,Ok. So if we both had Emma and I die <knocks on table>  she'd have to give her up.,3
S09E08 Rachels Other Sister.txt,Chandler,"So.. let me get this straight. So my two friends die, I get Emma. Then my wife dies, then Emma the one tiny ray of hope left in my life gets taken away from me?",3

S09E08 Rachels Other Sister.txt,Chandler,"Alright! That is it. This is our apartment and you can not behave this way. Now if you can't act your age then you shouldn't be here at all.

S09E07 Rosss Inappropriate Song.txt,Chandler,"Because that's who I am, okay? I'm sure a mature man like Richard could see a tape like that and it wouldn't bother him. Just'd be another saucy anecdote for him to share at his men's club over brandy and moustaches.",61
S09E07 Rosss Inappropriate Song.txt,Chandler,This is about you and Richard. He's clearly not over you. He keeps a tape so he can... look at it whenever he wants.,61

S09E10 Christmas In Tulsa.txt,Chandler,"Uh, four, a boy, twin girls and another boy.",90
S09E10 Christmas In Tulsa.txt,Chandler,"Well, stuff like where we'd live, y'know? Like a small place outside the city, where our kids could learn to ride their bikes and stuff. Y'know, we could have a cat that had a bell on its collar and we could hear it every time it ran through the little kitty door. Of course, we'd have an apartment over the garage where Joey could grow old.",90
