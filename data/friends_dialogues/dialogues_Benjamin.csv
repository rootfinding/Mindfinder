S10E06 Rosss Grant.txt,Benjamin,"So, tell me about it.",39
S10E06 Rosss Grant.txt,Benjamin,M-m.,39

S10E06 Rosss Grant.txt,Benjamin,What?,39

S10E06 Rosss Grant.txt,Benjamin,"The selection committee has chosen the three of you as our finalists today. The ultimate decision will be based upon the answers you give to the questions I ask here. I'm gonna start with Dr. Li. Dr. Li, you claim the field is too reliant on the Linnaean taxonomic system. How do you propose to correct this problem?",56
S10E06 Rosss Grant.txt,Benjamin,"Dr. Biely, your proposal includes some field work. Where might that take place?",58
S10E06 Rosss Grant.txt,Benjamin,"Certainly. Very well. And Dr. Geller, when is my birthday?",58
S10E06 Rosss Grant.txt,Benjamin,Care to venture a guess?,59
S10E06 Rosss Grant.txt,Benjamin,"I see, and Dr. Biely?",61
S10E06 Rosss Grant.txt,Benjamin,"Certainly. Dr. Geller, which 1965 Shirelles hit was later covered by a popular British invasion band?",61
S10E06 Rosss Grant.txt,Benjamin,"No! I'm sorry, we were looking for ""Baby It's You"". Baby It's You.",62
S10E06 Rosss Grant.txt,Benjamin,"You're right, I apologize. Scratch the last question. Spell ""Boscodictiasaur"".",62
S10E06 Rosss Grant.txt,Benjamin,"Yeah, I just made it up. Spell it.",63
S10E06 Rosss Grant.txt,Benjamin,"No, it starts with a silent ""M"".",64
S10E06 Rosss Grant.txt,Benjamin,I've come here to apologize. I think I may have let my feelings for Charlie interfere with the interview process.,84
S10E06 Rosss Grant.txt,Benjamin,"Anyway, I've decided to offer you the grant.",85
S10E06 Rosss Grant.txt,Benjamin,Well... there is just one small... stipulation...,86
S10E06 Rosss Grant.txt,Benjamin,"Hey, you got one right!",86
S10E06 Rosss Grant.txt,Benjamin,"Crazy, or... romantic?",87
S10E06 Rosss Grant.txt,Benjamin,Ooor...,87
S10E06 Rosss Grant.txt,Benjamin,Dr. Geller...? Charlie... What are you... what are you doing here?,105
S10E06 Rosss Grant.txt,Benjamin,"Like I tried to tell you in the interview Ross, this grant is not based on your knowledge of pretty useless trivia.",105
S10E06 Rosss Grant.txt,Benjamin,"Alright, it's true. I behaved horribly. But it's only because I still love you. And I would do anything to have you back in my life.",105
S10E06 Rosss Grant.txt,Benjamin,"I never should have broken up with you. I think about you all the time. I mean, do you ever still think about me?",105
S10E06 Rosss Grant.txt,Benjamin,"Listen, I know, I may be way out of bounds here, but is there any chance you will take me back?",106
S10E06 Rosss Grant.txt,Benjamin,I love you!,109
