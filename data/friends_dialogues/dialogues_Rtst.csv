S02E08 The List.txt,Rtst,Mockolate.,20
S02E08 The List.txt,Rtst,Mockolate. It's a completely synthetic chocolate substitute.,20
S02E08 The List.txt,Rtst,"Go ahead. Try a piece. Yeah, we think that Mockolate is even better than chocolate.",21
S02E08 The List.txt,Rtst,Yeah?,22
S02E08 The List.txt,Rtst,"No, ma'am. Well, anyhoo, we should be getting our F.D.A. approval any day now, hopefully, in time for Thanksgiving. See, the way we look at it, chocolate already dominates most of your major food-preparation holidays: Easter, Christmas, what have you.",23
S02E08 The List.txt,Rtst,"But, we're thinking, given the right marketing, we can make Thanksgiving the Mockolate holiday.",24
S02E08 The List.txt,Rtst,Aren't you going to swallow that?,24
S02E08 The List.txt,Rtst,"Yeah, isn't that great?",24
S02E08 The List.txt,Rtst,"Well, anyhoo, um, we are looking for a couple of chefs who can create some Thanksgiving-themed recipes. You think you might be interested?",25
S02E08 The List.txt,Rtst,Really?,26
S02E08 The List.txt,Rtst,Doesn't matter.,76
S02E08 The List.txt,Rtst,Our FDA approval didn't come through. Something about laboratory rats.,76
S02E08 The List.txt,Rtst,"Oh, some, that's fine. Some is fine. Some is not a lot. So, it doesn't burn when you pee, does it?",77
S02E08 The List.txt,Rtst,"Hi, thanks for coming in again.",87
S02E08 The List.txt,Rtst,"It's like I'm lookin' in a mirror. Anyway, they're called ""fishtachios"". They taste exactly like pistachios, but they're made primarily of reconstituted fish bits. Here, try one. You're not allergic to anything, are you?",87
S02E08 The List.txt,Rtst,"Oh, sorry.",87
