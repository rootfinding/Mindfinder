S02E02 The Breast Milk.txt,Ross,"This is my son having lunch, ok? It's gonna happen a lot, so you'd better get used to it. Now if you have any problem with it, if you're uncomfortable, just ask questions. Carol's fine with it, now come on.",8

S02E02 The Breast Milk.txt,Ross,My mommies love me. That's clever.,32
S02E02 The Breast Milk.txt,Ross,"Thanks Aunt Pheebs. Hey, you didn't microwave that, did you, because it's breast milk, and you're not supposed to do that.",34

S03E08 The Giant Poking Device.txt,Ross,Why? Why can’t you go to him?,6
S03E08 The Giant Poking Device.txt,Ross,"Pheebs, come on, you didn’t kill anybody, these people just happened to die when you went to the dentist. It’s, it’s, it’s just ah, a coincidence.",6
S03E08 The Giant Poking Device.txt,Ross,"Okay, I have a problem I have to go into work for a few hours, some kids messed up the Homo Sapien display.",15
S03E08 The Giant Poking Device.txt,Ross,"Well, they painted over the word ‘Sapien’ for one thing, then they rearranged the figures, let’s just leave it at that.",15
S03E08 The Giant Poking Device.txt,Ross,"Yes, that’s what I was going to ask, thank you.",15

S06E14 Chandler Cant Cry.txt,Ross,So that’s the only reason she could be here huh? It couldn’t have anything to do with the fact that-that maybe I’m a good listener and I uh I put on a great slide show!,66
S06E14 Chandler Cant Cry.txt,Ross,"Umm, she kissed me.",72
S06E14 Chandler Cant Cry.txt,Ross,"Look, I uh, I tried not to kiss her, okay?",74

S08E15 The Birthing Video.txt,Ross,Ever?!,47
S08E15 The Birthing Video.txt,Ross,"Oh, no, no, no, I will! I just want to butter her up, first! You know, I’m going to take her to an amazing Valentine’s dinner.

S08E15 The Birthing Video.txt,Ross,Uh…Mona just dumped me.,78
S08E15 The Birthing Video.txt,Ross,"Well, with everything that’s been going on lately, I haven’t exactly been the perfect boyfriend. You know, I, uh, I didn’t tell her I got Rachel pregnant. I gave her a key to my apartment, and then had the locks changed! And then I lied to her about Rachel moving in with me. In a way, I actually judge her for not breaking up with me sooner, you know?",78
S08E15 The Birthing Video.txt,Ross,"Yeah. Wait a minute. What are you doing here? Joey Tribbiani without a date on Valentine’s Day? What’s going on, huh? Girl trouble?",78
