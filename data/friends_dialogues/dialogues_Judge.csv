S06E05 Joeys Porsche.txt,Judge,Okay you two are asking the court for an annulment?,44
S06E05 Joeys Porsche.txt,Judge,So based on your petition you are seeking an annulment on the grounds that Mr. Geller is mentally unstable.,44
S06E05 Joeys Porsche.txt,Judge,And based on the fact that Mr. Geller is intravenous drug user.,44
S06E05 Joeys Porsche.txt,Judge,Now it also says here that you lied about your sexual preference before marriage?,44
S06E05 Joeys Porsche.txt,Judge,"And finally that you were unable to consummate the marriage. Well, that makes sense since you’re gay and addicted to heroin.",45
S06E05 Joeys Porsche.txt,Judge,That won’t be necessary.,45
S06E05 Joeys Porsche.txt,Judge,"Now if you were two involved in a serious relationship, that really creates a problem.",45
S06E05 Joeys Porsche.txt,Judge,"Is there, anything in this record that is actually true?",46
S06E05 Joeys Porsche.txt,Judge,"Well, based on what I heard, you two certainly don’t qualify for an annulment. If you two don’t want to be together you’ll have to file for divorce.",46
S06E05 Joeys Porsche.txt,Judge,You need to get out of my chambers.,50
S06E05 Joeys Porsche.txt,Judge,Would you like to spend the night in jail?,50
