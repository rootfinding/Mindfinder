S04E13 Rachels Crush.txt,Joey,"Chandler, look they’re actors. They’re there to do a job, just ‘cause they work together, doesn’t mean they’re gonna get together. I mean just ‘cause it happened with Susan Sarandon and Tim Robbins, it doesn’t mean it’s gonna happen with them.",18
S04E13 Rachels Crush.txt,Joey,Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman.,18
S04E13 Rachels Crush.txt,Joey,"Okay look, look, let me ask you a question, when they were doing it on stage, was it like really hot?",18
S04E13 Rachels Crush.txt,Joey,"Well okay, so then you’re fine. The rule is when two actors are actually doing it off-stage all the sexual tension between them is gone. Okay? So as long as it’s hot onstage you got nothing to worry about. It’s when the heat goes away, that’s when you’re in trouble.",18
S04E13 Rachels Crush.txt,Joey,"Look, you guys have been to every play I’ve ever been in, have I ever had chemistry on stage?",18

S04E13 Rachels Crush.txt,Joey,"Oh-oh-oh-oh, how I do it is, I look a woman up and down and say, ""Hey, how you doin’?""",55
S04E13 Rachels Crush.txt,Joey,"Well, you gotta give him something that he can’t say no too. Like uh, Knicks tickets! Invite the guy to a Knicks game, you’re guaranteed he’ll say yes!",58
S04E13 Rachels Crush.txt,Joey,"Absolutely! And if it doesn’t, can I get the extra ticket?",58
S04E13 Rachels Crush.txt,Joey,What the heck is that?,59

S08E08 The Stripper.txt,Joey,"Oh yeah, that was a pretty good night.",7
S08E08 The Stripper.txt,Joey,"So uh, you and Mona, been a while now. How’s it going?",23

S08E08 The Stripper.txt,Joey,"Yeah, that’s one naked hooker!",35
S08E08 The Stripper.txt,Joey,"Wait! Wait! Maybe she’s a hooker and a stripper, but she got confused about what she’s supposed to do.",45
S08E08 The Stripper.txt,Joey,"Maybe Monica’s playing a joke on ya. Y’know? Getting her own husband a hooker, that’s pretty funny.",47
S08E08 The Stripper.txt,Joey,I bet Ross was in on it too. I mean he was conveniently busy.,47
S08E08 The Stripper.txt,Joey,Maybe she meant to get you a hooker.,53
S08E08 The Stripper.txt,Joey,"Maybe she wants you to learn something. Huh? Now is there anything you’re really bad at y’know, sexually?",53
S08E08 The Stripper.txt,Joey,In a minute!,53
S08E08 The Stripper.txt,Joey,"All right, all right maybe-maybe you should just ask her to leave.",54
