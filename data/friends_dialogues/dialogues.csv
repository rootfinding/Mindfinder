S07E05 The Engagement Picture.txt,Rachel,"Y’know, all the women.",58
S07E05 The Engagement Picture.txt,Joey,"Hey well, you can’t teach someone to be good with women. Y’know, that’s why I never had any luck with Chandler.",58
S07E05 The Engagement Picture.txt,Rachel,"All right, would-would you mind just not going out with him again? Okay, just the idea of you and he and all these women, it’s just—And I know he’s my assistant and I can’t date him—but it just bothers me, all right?!",59

S07E05 The Engagement Picture.txt,Rachel,"I just don’t want him to meet anybody until I am over my crush—And I will get over it. It’s-it’s not like I love him, it’s just physical! But—I mean I get crushes like this all the time! I mean hell, I had a crush on you when I first met ya!",60
S07E05 The Engagement Picture.txt,Joey,"I know, Monica told me.",60

S07E05 The Engagement Picture.txt,Ross,"Listen, you are hearing one side of the story, okay—and F.Y.I she must’ve shown Kyle over 30 paint samples before she painted that room! And his response to each one was, ""I don’t give a tiny rat’s ass.""",71
S07E05 The Engagement Picture.txt,Phoebe,"Yeah well, maybe she should’ve spent a little less time decorating and a little more time in the bedroom.",71
S07E05 The Engagement Picture.txt,Ross,"Well, I don’t think we are gonna have that problem, but maybe that’s just because I am not emotionally unavailable!",71
S07E05 The Engagement Picture.txt,Phoebe,You think he’s emotionally unavailable?,71
S07E05 The Engagement Picture.txt,Ross,I think he can be.,71
S07E05 The Engagement Picture.txt,Phoebe,"Well, maybe he wouldn’t be she didn’t bring the office home every night!",71
S07E05 The Engagement Picture.txt,Ross,"Well, excuse her for knowing what she wants to do with her life!",71
S07E05 The Engagement Picture.txt,Phoebe,"Yeah well, she certainly knew what she was doing New Year’s Eve 1997.",71
S07E05 The Engagement Picture.txt,Tag,Good morning Rachel.,75
S07E05 The Engagement Picture.txt,Tag,Went out with Joey.,76
S07E05 The Engagement Picture.txt,Rachel,Oh yeah? Another night of birdogging the chickas?,76

S07E05 The Engagement Picture.txt,Rachel,Wow! I did not see that coming.,76
S07E05 The Engagement Picture.txt,Tag,"It’s just not really who I am. Y'know, I’ve always been happier when…Why am I telling you this? You don’t care about this stuff.",76
S07E05 The Engagement Picture.txt,Rachel,"Oh no, yes I do! I do! I mean, come on go on, you were, you were saying I am happier when uh, y’know?",76

S07E05 The Engagement Picture.txt,Rachel,Really?,76
S07E05 The Engagement Picture.txt,Tag,"Someone I can spoil, y’know?",76
S07E05 The Engagement Picture.txt,Rachel,Sp-spoil?,76
S07E05 The Engagement Picture.txt,Tag,Uh-huh! Let me ask you something?,76
S07E05 The Engagement Picture.txt,Rachel,Uh-huh.,76
S07E05 The Engagement Picture.txt,Tag,Do you believe that there is one perfect person for everyone?,76
S07E05 The Engagement Picture.txt,Rachel,"Well, I-I’m startin’ too.",76
S07E05 The Engagement Picture.txt,Tag,"And if that person is already in your life, you should do something about it right?",76

S07E05 The Engagement Picture.txt,Ross,My God!,78
S07E05 The Engagement Picture.txt,Phoebe,"Oh, I’m sorry. Is that annoying? And speaking about being selfish in bed, how’s Whitney?",78
S07E05 The Engagement Picture.txt,Ross,Well maybe she wouldn’t have to be selfish in bed if someone else knew where everything was!,78
S07E05 The Engagement Picture.txt,Kyle,"Oh hey! Good, you’re both here.",80
S07E05 The Engagement Picture.txt,Whitney,We kinda need to talk.,80
S07E05 The Engagement Picture.txt,Phoebe,Both of you together?,80

S07E05 The Engagement Picture.txt,Phoebe,"Oh right, because you’re so capable of change.",81
S07E05 The Engagement Picture.txt,Whitney,I do know.,82
S07E05 The Engagement Picture.txt,Ross,"It makes him miss the bowl, but whatever.",82
S07E05 The Engagement Picture.txt,Ross,"That’s all right, we-we don’t need you. In fact, hey I’m over it already.",83
S07E05 The Engagement Picture.txt,Phoebe,"Yeah, and y’know what? I don’t give a tiny rat’s ass.",83

S01E18 All The Poker.txt,Monica,And you know what? We want a rematch.,31
S01E18 All The Poker.txt,Ross,Well that's fine with me. Could use the money.,31

S01E18 All The Poker.txt,Ross,I'm not a nice guy.,35
S01E18 All The Poker.txt,Ross,"Alright boys, let's eat.",36
S01E18 All The Poker.txt,Chandler,"Oh, did you get that from the 'I Love Rachel' pizzeria?",36

S01E18 All The Poker.txt,Chandler,"Oh yes, yes, we could play some other game... like, uh, I don't know... Pictionary?",51
S01E18 All The Poker.txt,Monica,"Ha, ha, very funny, very funny. But I think we'd like to give poker another try. Shall we, ladies?",52
S01E18 All The Poker.txt,Ross,"Uh, Rach, do you want me to shuffle those?",52

S01E18 All The Poker.txt,Ross,"Well, that just leaves the big Green poker machine, who owes fifteen...",55
S01E18 All The Poker.txt,Monica,"You know what? This is not over. We will play you again, and we will win, and you will lose, and you will beg, and we will laugh, and we will take every last dime you have, and you will hate yourselves forever.",56
S01E18 All The Poker.txt,Rachel,"Hmm. Kinda stepped on my point there, Mon.",56
S01E18 All The Poker.txt,Ross,"So, you gals wanna hand over your money now? That way, we don't have to go through the formality of actually playing.",57

S01E18 All The Poker.txt,Rachel,"Well, I just lost a job, and I'd like to raise the bet five bucks. Does anybody have a problem with that?",94
S01E18 All The Poker.txt,Rachel,"What do you mean, you fold? Hey, come on! What is this? I thought that 'once the cards were dealt, I'm not a nice guy.' I mean, what, were you just full of it?",98
S01E18 All The Poker.txt,Rachel,How many you want?,100
S01E18 All The Poker.txt,Rachel,"See your twenty-five...and...uh, Monica, get my purse.",106

S07E08 Chandler Doesnt Like Dogs.txt,Chandler,"No, no, no. No-no-no.",3
S07E08 Chandler Doesnt Like Dogs.txt,Ross,"What, are we keeping Thanksgiving a secret this year?",3
S07E08 Chandler Doesnt Like Dogs.txt,Chandler,"No, we're playing this game I learned at work. You have to name all the states in six minutes.",3
S07E08 Chandler Doesnt Like Dogs.txt,Ross,What? That's like insanely easy!,3
S07E08 Chandler Doesnt Like Dogs.txt,Monica,"It's a stupid game and I wasn't playing against other people, so technically I didn't lose.",4
S07E08 Chandler Doesnt Like Dogs.txt,Ross,What? You forgot fourteen states?,4
S07E08 Chandler Doesnt Like Dogs.txt,Chandler,"Oh, okay, time's up!",6
S07E08 Chandler Doesnt Like Dogs.txt,Rachel,"All right, I got 48.",6
S07E08 Chandler Doesnt Like Dogs.txt,Chandler,"Oh that's not bad, Pheebs?",6
S07E08 Chandler Doesnt Like Dogs.txt,Phoebe,"Oh, I got tired of naming states. So I decided to list the types of celery, and I have one: regular celery.",6
S07E08 Chandler Doesnt Like Dogs.txt,Chandler,"Okay, so Rachel's got 48 and Phoebe has the lead in…vegetables, Joey?",6
S07E08 Chandler Doesnt Like Dogs.txt,Joey,Say hello to the new champ of Chandler's dumb states game.,6
S07E08 Chandler Doesnt Like Dogs.txt,Ross,"Wow, how many have you got?",6
S07E08 Chandler Doesnt Like Dogs.txt,Joey,Fifty-six!,6
S07E08 Chandler Doesnt Like Dogs.txt,Joey,Hey! How is New England not a state? Huh? They have a sports-team!,7
S07E08 Chandler Doesnt Like Dogs.txt,Monica,'Cause you invited your assistant.,10
S07E08 Chandler Doesnt Like Dogs.txt,Rachel,"Oh, right. Sorry. But Tag's not coming; his girlfriend came into town, so he's spending Thanksgiving with her.",10
S07E08 Chandler Doesnt Like Dogs.txt,Monica,Oh! Why didn't you tell me? I made him his own individual sweet potato stuffed pumpkin.,10
S07E08 Chandler Doesnt Like Dogs.txt,Rachel,"Well, I was going to, but then I figured, you know... you're food is so delicious and perfect, you can never have too many of those pumpkin things.",10
S07E08 Chandler Doesnt Like Dogs.txt,Ross,Done! With time a-to-spare.,12
S07E08 Chandler Doesnt Like Dogs.txt,Ross,"You know, I hate to lecture you guys, but it's kinda disgraceful, that a group of well-educated adults and Joey can't name all the states. Did you ever see a map, or one of those round, colorful things called ""a globe?"" Hmm?",13
S07E08 Chandler Doesnt Like Dogs.txt,Ross,What? That's impossible.,14
S07E08 Chandler Doesnt Like Dogs.txt,Joey,"46. Wow! Who's well educated now, Mr. I-forgot-ten-states?",14
S07E08 Chandler Doesnt Like Dogs.txt,Monica,"All right, I'm out of oven space. I'm gonna turn on Joey's. Please, watch him! Do not let Joey eat any of the food!",14
S07E08 Chandler Doesnt Like Dogs.txt,Ross,"No, just give me another minute.",15
S07E08 Chandler Doesnt Like Dogs.txt,Chandler,"Look Ross, if you don't know them by now, you will never know them, okay? That is the beauty of this game. It makes you want to kill yourself.",15
S07E08 Chandler Doesnt Like Dogs.txt,Ross,"This-this is crazy! I can do this! All right, uhh, I bet I can get all 50 before dinner.",15
S07E08 Chandler Doesnt Like Dogs.txt,Chandler,"Okay, but if you can't…no dinner!",15
S07E08 Chandler Doesnt Like Dogs.txt,Ross,You're on!,15
S07E08 Chandler Doesnt Like Dogs.txt,Joey,"But the drawer full of take-out menus is okay, right?",17
S07E08 Chandler Doesnt Like Dogs.txt,Monica,"Ross, I'm gonna use yours, okay?",17
S07E08 Chandler Doesnt Like Dogs.txt,Ross,Pshhshhh!,17
S07E08 Chandler Doesnt Like Dogs.txt,Chandler,"Sure, and Joey; do not let Ross look at any of the maps or the globe in your apartment.",18
S07E08 Chandler Doesnt Like Dogs.txt,Joey,"Don't worry, Chandler, it's not a globe of the United States.",18
S07E08 Chandler Doesnt Like Dogs.txt,Phoebe,Hey you guys I'm gonna go out and take a walk.,19
S07E08 Chandler Doesnt Like Dogs.txt,Ross,"Phoebe, why is your bag moving?",19
S07E08 Chandler Doesnt Like Dogs.txt,Phoebe,"Oh, it's not!",19
S07E08 Chandler Doesnt Like Dogs.txt,Rachel,"Seriously, it's moving!",19
S07E08 Chandler Doesnt Like Dogs.txt,Joey,What the hell is in there?,19
S07E08 Chandler Doesnt Like Dogs.txt,Monica,Ross’s apartment is nice! How come we don't hang out here more often?,21
S07E08 Chandler Doesnt Like Dogs.txt,Chandler,I don't know. Maybe it's because it smells a little weird. It's like old pumpkins or something.,21
S07E08 Chandler Doesnt Like Dogs.txt,Monica,That's my pie!,21
S07E08 Chandler Doesnt Like Dogs.txt,Chandler,Which smells delicious!,21
S07E08 Chandler Doesnt Like Dogs.txt,Monica,Uh-oh! Uh-oh!,21
S07E08 Chandler Doesnt Like Dogs.txt,Chandler,What?,21
S07E08 Chandler Doesnt Like Dogs.txt,Monica,"Phoebe, why is there a dog in our apartment?",24
S07E08 Chandler Doesnt Like Dogs.txt,Phoebe,"I'm sorry, who's this?",24
S07E08 Chandler Doesnt Like Dogs.txt,Monica,"Phoebe, there's a dog sitting on my couch!",24
S07E08 Chandler Doesnt Like Dogs.txt,Chandler,"Tell her, I'm allergic, and I will sue!",24
S07E08 Chandler Doesnt Like Dogs.txt,Phoebe,"No, there's no dog here?",24
S07E08 Chandler Doesnt Like Dogs.txt,Monica,I'll be right there!,26
S07E08 Chandler Doesnt Like Dogs.txt,Tag,"I, uh, wanted to see if your offer to spend Thanksgiving with you is still good.",28
S07E08 Chandler Doesnt Like Dogs.txt,Tag,We kinda broke up this morning.,29
S07E08 Chandler Doesnt Like Dogs.txt,Rachel,"Oh, I'm sorry.",29
S07E08 Chandler Doesnt Like Dogs.txt,Tag,"Yeah, so she went back to Ohio.",29
S07E08 Chandler Doesnt Like Dogs.txt,Ross,Ohio!! Thank you!,29
S07E08 Chandler Doesnt Like Dogs.txt,Chandler,Huh! Where is the dog?!,30
S07E08 Chandler Doesnt Like Dogs.txt,Ross,What dog? There-there's no dog here.,30
S07E08 Chandler Doesnt Like Dogs.txt,Joey,Yeah that dog left!,30
S07E08 Chandler Doesnt Like Dogs.txt,Phoebe,There's no dog in here.,31
S07E08 Chandler Doesnt Like Dogs.txt,Chandler,"Phoebe, we can hear the dog barking!",32
S07E08 Chandler Doesnt Like Dogs.txt,Chandler,What is it doing here?,33
S07E08 Chandler Doesnt Like Dogs.txt,Monica,"Oooh, I wish she could stay here, but Chandler is allergic!",34
S07E08 Chandler Doesnt Like Dogs.txt,Chandler,"Extremely allergic, okay? If I'm anywhere near a dog for more than 5 minutes, my throat will just close up!",34
S07E08 Chandler Doesnt Like Dogs.txt,Phoebe,"That's odd, 'cause this dog's been living here for the past 3 days",34
S07E08 Chandler Doesnt Like Dogs.txt,Monica,"Chandler, if that dog's been here that long, and you haven't had a reaction, maybe you're not allergic to this dog?",35
S07E08 Chandler Doesnt Like Dogs.txt,Chandler,"Well, it still has to go, right?",35
S07E08 Chandler Doesnt Like Dogs.txt,Chandler,"Okay, it's um…",35
S07E08 Chandler Doesnt Like Dogs.txt,Monica,Don't do what?,36
S07E08 Chandler Doesnt Like Dogs.txt,All,What?,37
S07E08 Chandler Doesnt Like Dogs.txt,Phoebe,Are you crazy?,37
S07E08 Chandler Doesnt Like Dogs.txt,Ross,Are you out of your mind?,37
S07E08 Chandler Doesnt Like Dogs.txt,Phoebe,Why?,37
S07E08 Chandler Doesnt Like Dogs.txt,Chandler,"They are needy, they are jumpy, and you can't tell what they are thinking, and that scares me a little bit.",38
S07E08 Chandler Doesnt Like Dogs.txt,Rachel,"Wait a minute. Do you not like all dogs? I mean, not even puppies?",39
S07E08 Chandler Doesnt Like Dogs.txt,Tag,You don't like puppies?,40
S07E08 Chandler Doesnt Like Dogs.txt,Joey,"Look, Chandler, I told you, never tell anyone about this dog thing. It's like Ross not likin’ ice cream.",41
S07E08 Chandler Doesnt Like Dogs.txt,Phoebe,You don't like ice cream?,41
S07E08 Chandler Doesnt Like Dogs.txt,Ross,It's too cold.,41
S07E08 Chandler Doesnt Like Dogs.txt,Chandler,"Okay, it's just that dogs make me a little uncomfortable.",41
S07E08 Chandler Doesnt Like Dogs.txt,Ross,How can I not get this? I'm a college professor; I got 1450 on my S.A.T.s.,44
S07E08 Chandler Doesnt Like Dogs.txt,Monica,1250.,44
S07E08 Chandler Doesnt Like Dogs.txt,Ross,"Damn, I forgot you were here.",44
S07E08 Chandler Doesnt Like Dogs.txt,Rachel,"Oh, wait before you guys go, can I just ask you a question?",45
S07E08 Chandler Doesnt Like Dogs.txt,Monica,Yeah.,45
S07E08 Chandler Doesnt Like Dogs.txt,Rachel,"When a guy breaks up with his girlfriend, what is an appropriate amount of time to wait before you make a move?",45
S07E08 Chandler Doesnt Like Dogs.txt,Phoebe,"Oh, I'd say about a month.",45
S07E08 Chandler Doesnt Like Dogs.txt,Monica,Really? I'd say 3 to 4.,45
S07E08 Chandler Doesnt Like Dogs.txt,Rachel,Interesting.,46
S07E08 Chandler Doesnt Like Dogs.txt,Monica,"When it's your assistant, I would say never.",46
S07E08 Chandler Doesnt Like Dogs.txt,Joey,"All right, Rach, the big question is, does he like you? All right? Because if he doesn't like you, this is all a moo-point.",46
S07E08 Chandler Doesnt Like Dogs.txt,Rachel,Huh. A moo-point?,46
S07E08 Chandler Doesnt Like Dogs.txt,Joey,"Yeah, it's like a cow's opinion. It just doesn't matter. It's moo.",46
S07E08 Chandler Doesnt Like Dogs.txt,Monica,"Please, don't listen to Joey, okay. Would you look at him? He-he’s obviously depressed. He's away from his family; he's spending Thanksgiving with strangers.   What he needs right now is for you to be his friend.",47
S07E08 Chandler Doesnt Like Dogs.txt,Rachel,"You're right, I'm sorry. Thank you. Okay, that's what I'm gonna do.",47
S07E08 Chandler Doesnt Like Dogs.txt,Joey,"Fine! Take their advice. No one ever listens to me. When the package is this pretty, no one cares what's inside.",47
S07E08 Chandler Doesnt Like Dogs.txt,Rachel,Hey!,48
S07E08 Chandler Doesnt Like Dogs.txt,Tag,Hey.,48
S07E08 Chandler Doesnt Like Dogs.txt,Rachel,How are you holding up?,48
S07E08 Chandler Doesnt Like Dogs.txt,Tag,Not bad.,48
S07E08 Chandler Doesnt Like Dogs.txt,Rachel,Yeah? I'm sorry about your girlfriend.,48
S07E08 Chandler Doesnt Like Dogs.txt,Tag,Thanks.,48
S07E08 Chandler Doesnt Like Dogs.txt,Rachel,So were you guys together a long time?,48
S07E08 Chandler Doesnt Like Dogs.txt,Tag,A year. On and off. I kinda thought we'd end up together. I don't anymore.,48
S07E08 Chandler Doesnt Like Dogs.txt,Rachel,Now that she broke up with you?,48
S07E08 Chandler Doesnt Like Dogs.txt,Tag,Yeah.,48
S07E08 Chandler Doesnt Like Dogs.txt,Rachel,Yeah. Hmmmm.,48
S07E08 Chandler Doesnt Like Dogs.txt,Tag,"It's weird. I always used to assume, that I would meet someone and fall in love and be happy and all that was just a given. But lately it's like what if it's not. Do you ever have that feeling?",48
S07E08 Chandler Doesnt Like Dogs.txt,Rachel,"No…Yeah, all the time, constantly. It's terrifying. But you know that I figure it…it has to work out.",48
S07E08 Chandler Doesnt Like Dogs.txt,Tag,Why?,48
S07E08 Chandler Doesnt Like Dogs.txt,Rachel,"Because, uh—it has to.",48
S07E08 Chandler Doesnt Like Dogs.txt,Tag,"You have all the answers, don't you?",48
S07E08 Chandler Doesnt Like Dogs.txt,Rachel,"Yeah, I know, I do. I really do.",48
S07E08 Chandler Doesnt Like Dogs.txt,Tag,"Hey, thanks for talking to me.",48
S07E08 Chandler Doesnt Like Dogs.txt,Tag,What?,50
S07E08 Chandler Doesnt Like Dogs.txt,Tag,What did Joey say? I like you back?,52
S07E08 Chandler Doesnt Like Dogs.txt,Rachel,"Uh, yeah, well, see, he… Joey knows, that I'm-I'm very insecure about my back and, and…you're hugging me, so obviously you are not repulsed by it, yeah!",52
S07E08 Chandler Doesnt Like Dogs.txt,Tag,Wait-wait a minute; that doesn't make any sense.,52
S07E08 Chandler Doesnt Like Dogs.txt,Rachel,"Yeah, I admit it. I have a crush on you, and uh, and, and I know that's crazy because we work together, and-and nothing could ever happen, and the last thing I want to do is-is to freak you out or make you feel uncomfortable. Which is why it would be really great if you said something right about now.",54
S07E08 Chandler Doesnt Like Dogs.txt,Rachel,What?,55

S07E08 Chandler Doesnt Like Dogs.txt,Ross,Because you sent away the dog!,70
S07E08 Chandler Doesnt Like Dogs.txt,Ross,"Oh, is it? Is it? Look, when Monica and I were kids, we had a dog named Rover. And, uh, one day, my dad decides, he doesn't like dogs. So Monica and her friend…Phyllis…take away the dog. And that was the last time we ever saw him. Don't you see? This is just like that. Only with a few details changed.",71
S07E08 Chandler Doesnt Like Dogs.txt,Chandler,"Monica's all upset, because I sent Clunkers away.",72

S07E08 Chandler Doesnt Like Dogs.txt,Ross,"Okay, maybe this is so hard, because there aren't 50 states. Let me tell you something, I have 49 states, and there are no more! I-I think, I should be able to eat something.",89
S07E08 Chandler Doesnt Like Dogs.txt,Chandler,It's up to you.,89

S07E08 Chandler Doesnt Like Dogs.txt,Rachel,"Ah, I-I never should have said what I said. It—y’know what? It just doesn't matter how I feel. I mean we work together, so nothing could really ever happen between us, and what I would love is just to go to work on Monday, and-and never talk about this again, okay? Big day Monday lots to do. So, we're okay?",93
S07E08 Chandler Doesnt Like Dogs.txt,Tag,"Um, I'm not.",93
S07E08 Chandler Doesnt Like Dogs.txt,Rachel,"Oh, god, I know it, that I freaked you out.",93

S07E21 The Vows.txt,Monica,There’s still so much to do. Have you written your vows yet?,2
S07E21 The Vows.txt,Monica,"Sweetie, you know I have no sense of humor when it comes to the wedding.",3

S07E21 The Vows.txt,Monica,Thank you.,10

S07E21 The Vows.txt,Chandler,"Yeah, I’m not sure I can do that.",14
S07E21 The Vows.txt,Ross,"...everyone, this is Chandler!",15
S07E21 The Vows.txt,Rachel,"Okay. Okay. Okay. Umm, maybe you can start with, ""Chandler, even though we were friends; there was a part of me that always knew I wanted more.""",17
S07E21 The Vows.txt,Chandler,"All right, there’s a nuclear holocaust, I’m the last man on Earth. Would you go out with me?",18

S07E21 The Vows.txt,Monica,"Ooh, are we allowed to lie in the vows?!",19
S07E21 The Vows.txt,Monica,It’s kind of an important one!,23
S07E21 The Vows.txt,Chandler,"Oh, y’know-y’know what, I was looking at it upside down.",23
S07E21 The Vows.txt,Joey,"Oh, I got it! How about saying something like, ""Monica…",26

S07E21 The Vows.txt,Monica,Oh yeah? When?,29
S07E21 The Vows.txt,Chandler,"All right. I'll tell you what. When we're 40, if neither one of us are married, what do you say you and I get together and have one?",29
S07E21 The Vows.txt,Monica,Why won't I be married when I'm 40?,29
S07E21 The Vows.txt,Chandler,"Oh, no, no. I just meant hypothetically.",29
S07E21 The Vows.txt,Monica,"Ok, hypothetically, why won't I be married when I'm 40?",29
S07E21 The Vows.txt,Chandler,"No, no, no.",29
S07E21 The Vows.txt,Monica,What is it? Is there something fundamentally unmarriable about me?,29
S07E21 The Vows.txt,Monica,Well?,30
S07E21 The Vows.txt,Chandler,Nice try.,35
S07E21 The Vows.txt,Chandler,"Look, Monica…",36

S07E21 The Vows.txt,Chandler,Okay. What if we lived together and you understand what I’m saying?,41
S07E21 The Vows.txt,Monica,You wanted it to be a surprise.,43

S07E21 The Vows.txt,Ross,How’s Monica coming along with her vows?,52
S07E21 The Vows.txt,Phoebe,"Well let’s just say its she’s lucky she has a sweet ass, ‘cause she’s not so good at the writing.",52
S07E21 The Vows.txt,Ross,I can’t believe in four weeks they’re gonna be married!,52
S07E21 The Vows.txt,Phoebe,Well let’s just hope it works. Y’know nine out of ten marriages end in divorce?,52

S07E21 The Vows.txt,Chandler,It happened in London.,63
S07E21 The Vows.txt,Joey,IN LONDON!!!,63

S07E21 The Vows.txt,Joey,"Yes, but y'know what? It doesn't matter who knows what. Now, enough of us know that we can just tell them that we know! Then all the lying and the secrets would finally be over!",79
S07E21 The Vows.txt,Phoebe,"Or, we could not tell them we know and have a little fun of our own",79
S07E21 The Vows.txt,Rachel,"All right honey, we'd better go if we wanna catch that movie.",80

S07E21 The Vows.txt,Rachel,You really think it would be that different?,107
S07E21 The Vows.txt,Phoebe,"How could it not be? I mean pretty soon they’re gonna be having kids, and then they’re just gonna be hanging out with other couples who have kids. And then maybe they’re gonna have to leave the city to be near a Volvo dealership.",107

S02E02 The Breast Milk.txt,Susan,This should be fun.,44
S02E02 The Breast Milk.txt,Ross,"No, no, Carol. There's nothing wrong with it. I just, I just don't think breast milk is for adults.",44
S02E02 The Breast Milk.txt,Chandler,Of course the packaging does appeal to grown-ups and kids alike.,44

S02E02 The Breast Milk.txt,Chandler,Howdy.,49
S02E02 The Breast Milk.txt,Chandler,"Well, maybe it's because of the way you're dressed.",50
S02E02 The Breast Milk.txt,Joey,Yeah I guess you're right.,54
S02E02 The Breast Milk.txt,Chandler,You're damn right I'm right. I say you show this guy what you're made of. I say you stand your ground. I say you show him that you are the baddest hombre west of the lingerie.,54

S02E02 The Breast Milk.txt,Monica,It's that terrible?,57
S02E02 The Breast Milk.txt,Monica,"Look, I know that you're in a place right now where you really need to hate Julie's guts, but she didn't do anything wrong. I mean, she was just a girl who met a guy, and now they go out. I really think that if you gave her a chance, you'd like her. Would you just give that a chance, for me?",61
S02E02 The Breast Milk.txt,Joey,"Yeah, I'm ready.",66
S02E02 The Breast Milk.txt,Customer,"You idiot, you stupid cowboy, you blinded me, I'm suing!",67

S02E02 The Breast Milk.txt,Julie,"I know, I probably shouldn't even tell you this, but I'm pretty much totally intimidated by you.",70
S02E02 The Breast Milk.txt,Rachel,Really? Me?,70
S02E02 The Breast Milk.txt,Julie,"Yes. Oh my god, are you kidding? Ross is so crazy about you, and I really wanted you to like me, and, it's probably me being totally paranoid, but I kinda got the feeling that maybe you don't.",70
S02E02 The Breast Milk.txt,Rachel,"Well, you're not totally paranoid.",70
S02E02 The Breast Milk.txt,Julie,Oy.,70
S02E02 The Breast Milk.txt,Rachel,"Um, ok, uh, oh god, um, when you and uh Ross first started going out, it was really hard for me, um, for many reasons, which I'm not gonna bore you with now, but um, I just, I see how happy he is, you know, and how good you guys are together, and um, Monica's always saying how nice you are, and god I hate it when she's right.",70
S02E02 The Breast Milk.txt,Julie,"Thanks. Hey, listen, would you like to go to a movie sometime or something?",70
S02E02 The Breast Milk.txt,Rachel,"Yeah, that'd be great. I'd love it.",70

S03E08 The Giant Poking Device.txt,Phoebe,"No thanks, I have a good one too. I just, I, I can’t see him.",6
S03E08 The Giant Poking Device.txt,Chandler,See that is the problem with invisible dentists.,6
S03E08 The Giant Poking Device.txt,Ross,Why? Why can’t you go to him?,6
S03E08 The Giant Poking Device.txt,Phoebe,"Because, every time I go to the dentist, somebody dies.",6
S03E08 The Giant Poking Device.txt,Chandler,"That is so weird, because every time I go to the dentist, I look down the hygienist’s blouse.",6
S03E08 The Giant Poking Device.txt,Rachel,"Phoebe, what? Umm...what?!",6
S03E08 The Giant Poking Device.txt,Phoebe,"Yeah, yeah, first there was my aunt Mary, and then there was umm, John, my mailman, and then my, my cowboy friend ‘Albino Bob’.",6
S03E08 The Giant Poking Device.txt,Rachel,And all these people actually died?,6
S03E08 The Giant Poking Device.txt,Phoebe,"Yes, while I was in the chair! That’s why I take such good care of my teeth now, y'know, it’s not about oral hygiene, I floss to save lives!",6
S03E08 The Giant Poking Device.txt,Ross,"Pheebs, come on, you didn’t kill anybody, these people just happened to die when you went to the dentist. It’s, it’s, it’s just ah, a coincidence.",6

S03E08 The Giant Poking Device.txt,Rachel,I promise.,9
S03E08 The Giant Poking Device.txt,Phoebe,"Although, don’t feel like you can’t visit.",9
S03E08 The Giant Poking Device.txt,Monica,"You guys, Joey just saw Janice kissing her ex-husband.",11
S03E08 The Giant Poking Device.txt,Joey,"Well, I was thinking about that and I, I think the best way would be, to not.",12
S03E08 The Giant Poking Device.txt,Rachel,"Joey, you can’t keep this to yourself, if you know about this, you have to tell him.",12
S03E08 The Giant Poking Device.txt,Joey,"It’ll kill him. I mean it’ll, it’ll just kill him.",12
S03E08 The Giant Poking Device.txt,Phoebe,"Well, you could wait ‘til I go to the dentist, maybe I’ll kill him.",12
S03E08 The Giant Poking Device.txt,Ross,"Okay, I have a problem I have to go into work for a few hours, some kids messed up the Homo Sapien display.",15
S03E08 The Giant Poking Device.txt,Joey,What did they do?,15
S03E08 The Giant Poking Device.txt,Ross,"Well, they painted over the word ‘Sapien’ for one thing, then they rearranged the figures, let’s just leave it at that.",15
S03E08 The Giant Poking Device.txt,Monica,"So, do you want me to watch Ben for you?",15
S03E08 The Giant Poking Device.txt,Ross,"Yes, that’s what I was going to ask, thank you.",15

S03E08 The Giant Poking Device.txt,Joey,"Oh my God, is she going back to him?",51
S03E08 The Giant Poking Device.txt,Chandler,"She doesn’t know. Says she loves us both. Y'know I woke up this morning and I was in love, well I was happy. Y'know it serves me right for buying that twelve pack of condoms. And now I can’t even return them, because she choked on the reciept!",51
S03E08 The Giant Poking Device.txt,Joey,"What are you ah, what are you gonna do?",51
S03E08 The Giant Poking Device.txt,Chandler,"I don’t know, y'know. What, what, would you do?",51
S03E08 The Giant Poking Device.txt,Joey,"Well, it doesn’t matter what I would do.",51
S03E08 The Giant Poking Device.txt,Chandler,"Come on, tell me.",51
S03E08 The Giant Poking Device.txt,Joey,"They have a kid together, y'know. They’re like, they’re like a family, and if, I don’t know, there’s chance they could make that work, I know I wouldn’t want to be the guy who stood in the way of that. Are you okay? Do you wanna ah, come poke a nude guy?",53
S03E08 The Giant Poking Device.txt,Ross,"Well, he’s finally alseep. About that ah, bump on his head?",54
S03E08 The Giant Poking Device.txt,Rachel,"Are you, are you, are you sure it’s ah, a new bump? I mean, no offense, I’ve always thought of Ben as a fairly bumpy headed child.",54
S03E08 The Giant Poking Device.txt,Ross,"It’s okay if he bumps his head, kids bump their heads all the time, y'know, it was your first time babysitting, I figured you did the best you could.",54
S03E08 The Giant Poking Device.txt,Ross,I know! I’m saying you have to watch them all the time.,55

S03E08 The Giant Poking Device.txt,Ross,"Umm, did you notice anything wierd about Ben today?",56
S03E08 The Giant Poking Device.txt,Monica,No. Why?,56
S03E08 The Giant Poking Device.txt,Ross,"Well, I was just playing with him, and y'know we were doing the alphabet song, which he used to be really good at, but suddenly he’s leaving out ‘e’ and ‘f.’ It’s like they just ah, I don’t know, fell out of his head.",56
S03E08 The Giant Poking Device.txt,Monica,Really?!,56
S03E08 The Giant Poking Device.txt,Rachel,I hope it’s still funny when you’re in hell.,58
S03E08 The Giant Poking Device.txt,Rachel,I’ll get the hat.,60
S03E08 The Giant Poking Device.txt,Chandler,"Janice, I have something I need to tell you, and I want you to let me get through it, because it’s, it’s, it’s not gonna be easy.",61
S03E08 The Giant Poking Device.txt,Janice,Okay.,61
S03E08 The Giant Poking Device.txt,Chandler,"I think you should go back with Gary. I don’t wanna be the guy that breaks up a family, y'know when my parents split up, it was because of that guy. Whenever I would see him I was always think y'know ‘You’re the reason, you are the reason why their not together.’ and I hated that guy. And it didn’t matter how nice he was, or how happy he made my Dad.",61
S03E08 The Giant Poking Device.txt,Janice,Wow!,61
S03E08 The Giant Poking Device.txt,Chandler,"Yeah, well. It’s the right thing to do.",61
S03E08 The Giant Poking Device.txt,Janice,"Oh! You’re right. Oh God. But, before I can say ‘good-bye’, there’s something I really need you to know, Chandler. The way I feel about you, it’s like, I finally understand what Lionel Richie’s been singing about. Y'know, I mean what we have, it’s like movie love, you’re my soulmate, and I can’t believe we’re not going to be spending the rest of our lives together.",61
S03E08 The Giant Poking Device.txt,Chandler,Then don’t leave me!,61
S03E08 The Giant Poking Device.txt,Janice,What?,61
S03E08 The Giant Poking Device.txt,Chandler,"Forget what I said, I was babbling! Pick me!",61
S03E08 The Giant Poking Device.txt,Janice,"No, you were right, you were right. I mean, I-I-I’ve got to give my marriage another chance.",61
S03E08 The Giant Poking Device.txt,Chandler,"No you don’t! No, no, no, I say you have to give your divorce another chance.",61
S03E08 The Giant Poking Device.txt,Chandler,Ohhh. Don’t go.,62
S03E08 The Giant Poking Device.txt,Chandler,No. No! No! No!,63

S03E08 The Giant Poking Device.txt,Gunther,Rachel has those in burgendy.,66
S03E08 The Giant Poking Device.txt,Joey,"All right now remember, something this big and long is going to be difficult to manuver, fortunately I have a lot of experience in that area.",67
S03E08 The Giant Poking Device.txt,Ross,"Can we please focus here, a naked man’s life hangs in the balance!",67
S03E08 The Giant Poking Device.txt,Phoebe,I’m telling you he’s dead. What we are about to have here is a dead fat guy on a stick.,67
S03E08 The Giant Poking Device.txt,Phoebe,He’s alive! He’s a-live!!!,69
S03E08 The Giant Poking Device.txt,Monica,"And yet, we’re still poking him.",69
S03E08 The Giant Poking Device.txt,Joey,"Okay, retract the device, retract the device.",69
S03E08 The Giant Poking Device.txt,Ross,He does not look happy.,69
S03E08 The Giant Poking Device.txt,Rachel,"Hey-hey, now he’s showing us his poking device.",69
S03E08 The Giant Poking Device.txt,Joey,"Hey, that’s never gonna make it all the way over here, buddy!",69

S10E08 The Late Thanksgiving.txt,Monica,We need to talk to you about something.,2
S10E08 The Late Thanksgiving.txt,Chandler,Yeah. We don't feel like we can host Thanksgiving this year.,2
S10E08 The Late Thanksgiving.txt,All,What?,2
S10E08 The Late Thanksgiving.txt,Phoebe,Hey!,2
S10E08 The Late Thanksgiving.txt,Ross,Are you kidding?,2
S10E08 The Late Thanksgiving.txt,Chandler,"Well, it's just with uhm, work and the stress of adoption, we just don't feel like we have the energy. Plus, we don't think it's fair that every year the burden falls on us.",2
S10E08 The Late Thanksgiving.txt,Chandler,"No, no! We made this decision together.",3
S10E08 The Late Thanksgiving.txt,Ross,She's putting words in your mouth!,3
S10E08 The Late Thanksgiving.txt,Joey,"Don't you put words in people's mouths, you put turkey in people's mouths!",3
S10E08 The Late Thanksgiving.txt,Rachel,I can't believe this! This is Emma's first Thanksgiving!,3
S10E08 The Late Thanksgiving.txt,Monica,"No, it's not!",3
S10E08 The Late Thanksgiving.txt,Phoebe,"Well, personally I think it's great you're giving yourself a break.",4
S10E08 The Late Thanksgiving.txt,Monica,"Thank you, Pheebs!",4
S10E08 The Late Thanksgiving.txt,Phoebe,"Sure. It's just as well... I mean, last year wasn't very good. I think she's losing her touch.",4
S10E08 The Late Thanksgiving.txt,Monica,"What? You are way off, lady!",4
S10E08 The Late Thanksgiving.txt,Phoebe,"Am I? Really? Am I? Well, why don't you cook Thanksgiving dinner and prove me wrong! Well, think about it, think about it, you'll be trying to top than you did last year. You'd be in competition... with yourself.",4
S10E08 The Late Thanksgiving.txt,Monica,"That's my favourite kind! Okay, we are doing this!",4
S10E08 The Late Thanksgiving.txt,Chandler,Don't let yourself get manipulated this way!,4
S10E08 The Late Thanksgiving.txt,Monica,"Hey, stay out of this, Chandler! This is between me... and ME!",4
S10E08 The Late Thanksgiving.txt,Chandler,We are supposed to make these decisions together! Did you not watch the Doctor Phil I taped for you?,4
S10E08 The Late Thanksgiving.txt,Phoebe,Hey!,5
S10E08 The Late Thanksgiving.txt,Rachel,Hi! Happy Thanksgiving!,5
S10E08 The Late Thanksgiving.txt,Phoebe,"Oh, yeah, happy needless-turkey-murder day.",5
S10E08 The Late Thanksgiving.txt,Monica,"You guys, I ordered some chocolate pies from that bakery on Bleecker. Could you pick them up for me?",5
S10E08 The Late Thanksgiving.txt,Phoebe,You're not making the pies yourself?,5
S10E08 The Late Thanksgiving.txt,Monica,"No, no, no, I don't make chocolate pies. When I was younger I-I enter in this pie-eating contest. I ate so many that just the thought of them made me sick.",5
S10E08 The Late Thanksgiving.txt,Rachel,Did you at least win the contest?,5
S10E08 The Late Thanksgiving.txt,Monica,"2 minutes, 12 pies and a part of one tin! Okay, I see you guys at 4.",5
S10E08 The Late Thanksgiving.txt,Rachel,Can't wait!,5
S10E08 The Late Thanksgiving.txt,Monica,"This dinner is gonna be so great! In your face, last year ""me""!",5
S10E08 The Late Thanksgiving.txt,Phoebe,Hey Rach.,6
S10E08 The Late Thanksgiving.txt,Rachel,Yeah.,6
S10E08 The Late Thanksgiving.txt,Phoebe,What's Emma doing today?,6
S10E08 The Late Thanksgiving.txt,Rachel,"Well, let's see... uh... I know that she has a meeting with her lawyer and then she has to make a very big poop. Why?",6
S10E08 The Late Thanksgiving.txt,Phoebe,"Well, I wanna enter her in a baby beauty pageant.",6
S10E08 The Late Thanksgiving.txt,Rachel,Oh my God! That's the creepiest thing I've ever heard!,6
S10E08 The Late Thanksgiving.txt,Phoebe,"Okay, but, well, before you say no, my friend Susanne is entering her kid and compared to Emma she's a real dog!",6
S10E08 The Late Thanksgiving.txt,Rachel,"Oh! Phoebe, all babies are beautiful!",6
S10E08 The Late Thanksgiving.txt,Rachel,"Phoebe, just the idea of pitting one baby against another, I mean, you know, and judging who's cuter just for a trophy...",7
S10E08 The Late Thanksgiving.txt,Rachel,And a thousand dollars.,7
S10E08 The Late Thanksgiving.txt,Phoebe,"Okay, oh, and Emma needs a cowgirl outfit for the competition.",8
S10E08 The Late Thanksgiving.txt,Rachel,Where am I gonna get a cowgirl outfit on Thanksgiving?,8
S10E08 The Late Thanksgiving.txt,Phoebe,"Well, I was thinking...",8
S10E08 The Late Thanksgiving.txt,Rachel,"Oh, take the clothes of Joey's Cabbage Patch Kid.",8
S10E08 The Late Thanksgiving.txt,Phoebe,Yeah!,8
S10E08 The Late Thanksgiving.txt,Chandler,Why come all the way from Kansas to do that?,10
S10E08 The Late Thanksgiving.txt,Chandler,"You know what just occurred to me? This could be our last Thanksgiving just the two of us. I mean, we could be getting a baby soon!",11
S10E08 The Late Thanksgiving.txt,Monica,You don't know that.,11
S10E08 The Late Thanksgiving.txt,Chandler,Somebody is gonna pick us.,11
S10E08 The Late Thanksgiving.txt,Monica,"Yeah, but we haven't heard a thing from the adoption agency and it has been weeks!",11
S10E08 The Late Thanksgiving.txt,Monica,Name one of his books.,12
S10E08 The Late Thanksgiving.txt,Monica,"Ok, let's see... uhm, okay, the turkey is in the oven, the stuffing is ready...",13
S10E08 The Late Thanksgiving.txt,Chandler,"You know, you always cook this meal all by yourself. Let me help this year.",13
S10E08 The Late Thanksgiving.txt,Monica,"Oh, Chandler, that's sweet. But you don't have to do everything Doctor Phil tells you to do.",13
S10E08 The Late Thanksgiving.txt,Chandler,"I'm serious, let me do something, just not the turkey or the stuffing, nothing ""high profile"".",13
S10E08 The Late Thanksgiving.txt,Monica,"Ok, let's see... Oh, the cranberry sauce, it is easy to make and no-one really cares about it.",13
S10E08 The Late Thanksgiving.txt,Chandler,Tell me more.,13
S10E08 The Late Thanksgiving.txt,Chandler,You obviously haven't tasted my Palmolive potatoes!,14
S10E08 The Late Thanksgiving.txt,Ross,"Hey! Hey, guess what Joey has!",15

S10E08 The Late Thanksgiving.txt,Chandler,"Hmm, the game's at one.",15
S10E08 The Late Thanksgiving.txt,Ross,So?,15
S10E08 The Late Thanksgiving.txt,Chandler,"Dinner is at four, we'll never gonna make it back.",15
S10E08 The Late Thanksgiving.txt,Joey,"So we'll leave before it's over, we'll be back in time.",15
S10E08 The Late Thanksgiving.txt,Chandler,"You say that now, but it could take us a long time to get back home. Plus Joey could get lost and and they could have to page us to go pick him up.",15
S10E08 The Late Thanksgiving.txt,Joey,"Dude, two times that happened!",15
S10E08 The Late Thanksgiving.txt,Chandler,"Look, Monica has been working hard all day, she didn't wanna host this thing in the first place, we shouldn't go!",15
S10E08 The Late Thanksgiving.txt,Ross,"He's right, man.",15

S10E08 The Late Thanksgiving.txt,Host,"This is contestant number sixteen, Rebecca...",18
S10E08 The Late Thanksgiving.txt,Phoebe,Hey.,18
S10E08 The Late Thanksgiving.txt,Rachel,"Oh Phoebe, listen. Well, I think we gotta go. This place is really freaking me out. I've been watching this guy over there, I don't think he came with a kid!",18
S10E08 The Late Thanksgiving.txt,Phoebe,"We can't leave now! There was this one baby, Haley, who was favourite to win and she got croup, so she had to stay home! This competition just blew wide open, folks!",18
S10E08 The Late Thanksgiving.txt,Rachel,"Phoebe, I think... It's just too weird, I just saw a one year old running around with pantyhose on!",18
S10E08 The Late Thanksgiving.txt,Rachel,"Oh, Phoebe! Come on! You know what, it's already three o'clock and they haven't even gotten to Emma's group yet. We gotta go, we got dinner!",19
S10E08 The Late Thanksgiving.txt,Rachel,"Phoebe, you have to calm down.",20
S10E08 The Late Thanksgiving.txt,Phoebe,"Okay. Rachel, the hottest babies in the Tri-State Area are in this room right now! I overheard one of the judges say that not one of them holds a candle to Emma!",20
S10E08 The Late Thanksgiving.txt,Rachel,Really?,20
S10E08 The Late Thanksgiving.txt,Phoebe,Yeah!,20
S10E08 The Late Thanksgiving.txt,Rachel,You heard them say that?,20
S10E08 The Late Thanksgiving.txt,Phoebe,Yeah!,20
S10E08 The Late Thanksgiving.txt,Rachel,"All right, okay. Alright, let's give to these babies something to cry about!",20
S10E08 The Late Thanksgiving.txt,Phoebe,Good! Oh yay! Let's get down to business! Emma needs some makeup!,20
S10E08 The Late Thanksgiving.txt,Rachel,"No, what?",20
S10E08 The Late Thanksgiving.txt,Phoebe,"Well, she's gonna look all washed out next to the other contestants!",20
S10E08 The Late Thanksgiving.txt,Rachel,"No Phoebe, I am not letting you put makeup on my baby!",20
S10E08 The Late Thanksgiving.txt,Phoebe,Why not!,20
S10E08 The Late Thanksgiving.txt,Rachel,Because I already did!,20
S10E08 The Late Thanksgiving.txt,Joey,"Oh, Bob, get off the guy!",22
S10E08 The Late Thanksgiving.txt,Ross,"Oh! What a game, huh?",22
S10E08 The Late Thanksgiving.txt,Joey,"I know, yeah.",22
S10E08 The Late Thanksgiving.txt,Ross,I can't believe Chandler is missing this!,22
S10E08 The Late Thanksgiving.txt,Ross,"Yeah, I'd probably enjoy it more if you didn't keep batting my hand away.",23
S10E08 The Late Thanksgiving.txt,Joey,Ohhhh! These seats are great!,23
S10E08 The Late Thanksgiving.txt,Ross,"Oh, but it's a kind game! So we're a little late, you know, the girls will be there, let's stay just for one more goal.",25

S10E08 The Late Thanksgiving.txt,Chandler,I can't believe they are not here! I slave and I slave for what? They've ruined cranberry day!,26
S10E08 The Late Thanksgiving.txt,Joey,How late are we?,27
S10E08 The Late Thanksgiving.txt,Ross,Forty-five minutes.,27
S10E08 The Late Thanksgiving.txt,Ross,You may want to lose the foam finger!,30
S10E08 The Late Thanksgiving.txt,Joey,"Oh, no, no, no, no, no. You just want to put it on your hand!",30
S10E08 The Late Thanksgiving.txt,Ross,Hey!,31
S10E08 The Late Thanksgiving.txt,Phoebe,Oh!,31
S10E08 The Late Thanksgiving.txt,Joey,You are not at Thanksgiving?,31

S10E08 The Late Thanksgiving.txt,Phoebe,"No, we're late!",31
S10E08 The Late Thanksgiving.txt,Rachel,What are you doing here!,31
S10E08 The Late Thanksgiving.txt,Phoebe,"Don't point that thing at me, Tribbiani!",33
S10E08 The Late Thanksgiving.txt,Ross,"So, nobody's here? Monica's gonna kill us!",33
S10E08 The Late Thanksgiving.txt,Joey,"Yeah, where were you!",33

S10E08 The Late Thanksgiving.txt,Phoebe,And it looks like she put makeup on her!,35
S10E08 The Late Thanksgiving.txt,Joey,"Wait a second, wait a second, where have I seen that cowgirl outfit before...",35
S10E08 The Late Thanksgiving.txt,Ross,"I can't believe this, she's our daughter! That you would treat her like some kind of showdog is inexcusable!",35
S10E08 The Late Thanksgiving.txt,Rachel,She won a thousand dollars!,35
S10E08 The Late Thanksgiving.txt,Ross,So this is an annual thing?,35
S10E08 The Late Thanksgiving.txt,Phoebe,"You guys, there are people in there who are not getting any happier!",36
S10E08 The Late Thanksgiving.txt,Ross,Yeah. What are we gonna do?,36
S10E08 The Late Thanksgiving.txt,Rachel,"Well, I don't know, you guys figure it out, I got to put Emma down for a nap.",36
S10E08 The Late Thanksgiving.txt,Joey,"All right. Hey Rach, while you're in there, throw something on Alicia Mae.",36
S10E08 The Late Thanksgiving.txt,Phoebe,"Alright, what are we gonna say?",36
S10E08 The Late Thanksgiving.txt,Ross,"Ooh, we'll say that we were mugged! You can't get mad at someone who's been mugged!",36
S10E08 The Late Thanksgiving.txt,Phoebe,"Oh, good, that's good, but you don't look like you were mugged!",36
S10E08 The Late Thanksgiving.txt,Monica,"Ohhh! Let me see! Oh God, I can't believe this! They're an hour late and they're just staying out there, talking!",41
S10E08 The Late Thanksgiving.txt,Monica,Oh! They're late and they're sloppy!,44
S10E08 The Late Thanksgiving.txt,Ross,I got mugged. And they stole my pocket.,46
S10E08 The Late Thanksgiving.txt,Rachel,"Oh, God. This is bad. This is so bad.",52
S10E08 The Late Thanksgiving.txt,Ross,"Well, let's just go in there and face them.",52
S10E08 The Late Thanksgiving.txt,Phoebe,"Well, I'm not going in first. I bet that vein on Monica's forehead is popping like crazy.",52
S10E08 The Late Thanksgiving.txt,Joey,"I hate that thing, it's like a... bolt of lightning.",52
S10E08 The Late Thanksgiving.txt,Ross,What is that?,54
S10E08 The Late Thanksgiving.txt,Joey,That's fire. Beats everything.,54
S10E08 The Late Thanksgiving.txt,Joey,"Ooh! Well played, Phoebe Buffay, well played.",55
S10E08 The Late Thanksgiving.txt,Rachel,"Alright, enough, enough, come on. Let's just all go in at the same time.",55
S10E08 The Late Thanksgiving.txt,Phoebe,It's locked.,56
S10E08 The Late Thanksgiving.txt,Ross,"Wha...? Oh sure, now they lock it, but when they're having sex on the couch, its like: ""Come on in, my butt is surprisingly hairy"".",56
S10E08 The Late Thanksgiving.txt,Monica,No! Everything's cold. The turkey's dried out and the... the stuffing is all soggy.,58
S10E08 The Late Thanksgiving.txt,Ross,"Come on you guys, we're sorry, alri...? Our subway broke down.",62
S10E08 The Late Thanksgiving.txt,Monica,That's all the turkey you're gonna get.,67
S10E08 The Late Thanksgiving.txt,Ross,How are we gonna decide who gets this?,68
S10E08 The Late Thanksgiving.txt,Phoebe,What are we gonna do? I'm starving.,69
S10E08 The Late Thanksgiving.txt,Phoebe,Oh yeah!,70
S10E08 The Late Thanksgiving.txt,Monica,"Hey, you touch that and you will be sorry.",71
S10E08 The Late Thanksgiving.txt,Ross,That's worse than no food.,75
S10E08 The Late Thanksgiving.txt,Chandler,HA-HA! All you got was Monica's stinky Brussels sprouts!,77
S10E08 The Late Thanksgiving.txt,Monica,Stinky?!,77
S10E08 The Late Thanksgiving.txt,Chandler,Please let me stay on this side of the door.,77
S10E08 The Late Thanksgiving.txt,Phoebe,"Well, I don't know if that's such a good idea. They clearly don't want to be with us.",79
S10E08 The Late Thanksgiving.txt,Ross,I don't know...,81
S10E08 The Late Thanksgiving.txt,Rachel,Oh!,84
S10E08 The Late Thanksgiving.txt,Joey,"Oh! It all looks so beautiful: the turkey, the stuffing...",86
S10E08 The Late Thanksgiving.txt,Chandler,The cranberries...?,87
S10E08 The Late Thanksgiving.txt,Monica,Oh! Enough! A monkey could have made 'em!,87
S10E08 The Late Thanksgiving.txt,Ross,I feel terrible.,91

S10E08 The Late Thanksgiving.txt,Rachel,Congratulatioooons!,95
S10E08 The Late Thanksgiving.txt,Monica,"Oh my God! YOU FORGOT THE PIES? Well, I cannot believe this. You force me to make dinner, then you're an hour late and you forget the one little thing that I asked you to do.",95
S10E08 The Late Thanksgiving.txt,Ross,"Really girls, not cool.",95
S10E08 The Late Thanksgiving.txt,Chandler,"Well, you manheads aren't any better. You lied about going to the game. You knew it would make you late, and you still went anyway.",95
S10E08 The Late Thanksgiving.txt,Joey,Hey! I'm getting a little tired of this okay? We said we're sorry. It's Thanksgiving for Pete's sakes! A day of forgiveness!,95
S10E08 The Late Thanksgiving.txt,Ross,It's a day to be thankful.,95
S10E08 The Late Thanksgiving.txt,Monica,It's too late for apologies.,96

S04E01 The Jellyfish.txt,Rachel,"You have! Ross, you should give yourself credit. I mean my Mom never thought this would work out. It was all, “Once a cheater, always a cheater.”",95

S06E09 Ross Got High.txt,Chandler,Why wouldn’t they be happy?,11
S06E09 Ross Got High.txt,Monica,"Well, um, because mainly, um, they don’t like you. I’m sorry.",11
S06E09 Ross Got High.txt,Chandler,What? What? Why?!,11
S06E09 Ross Got High.txt,Monica,"Maybe because you used to be aloof, or that you’re really sarcastic, or that, y’know, you joke around all the time. Or that you take off your clothes and throw them on the couch.",11
S06E09 Ross Got High.txt,Chandler,Is this why they don’t like me or why you don’t like me?,11
S06E09 Ross Got High.txt,Monica,"Look, I know that I should’ve told them. I know I shouldn’t care what they think. I’m sorry.",11

S06E09 Ross Got High.txt,Chandler,Well Monica just told me that they don’t.,16

S06E09 Ross Got High.txt,Ross,"I don’t know, I-I was all high.",78
S06E09 Ross Got High.txt,Chandler,Your parents caught Ross smoking pot in college and he blamed it on me!,80
S06E09 Ross Got High.txt,Monica,"Ross, I can’t believe you’d do that!",80
S06E09 Ross Got High.txt,Chandler,"The reason we haven’t told them we’re together is because they hate me, okay? So will you fix this?",80

S08E05 Rachels Date.txt,Phoebe,"Well maybe he was just nervous, y’know you can be very intimidating. And besides I’ve met your pastry chef and she can stand to be taken down a peg or two.",25
S08E05 Rachels Date.txt,Monica,"Well, now she has no eyebrows, mission accomplished.",25
S08E05 Rachels Date.txt,Phoebe,"But Monica, he loves his job so much! Can you just give him another chance? Please?",25

S08E05 Rachels Date.txt,Rachel,"Okay Joey, first of all Kash Ford is not people. Second of all, what did he say when you told him I was pregnant?",27
S08E05 Rachels Date.txt,Joey,I didn’t tell him. I didn’t know if you were telling people. This is back when I thought Kash was still people.,27
S08E05 Rachels Date.txt,Rachel,"Good-good, don’t tell him. Don’t tell him. Just have him call me okay?",27
S08E05 Rachels Date.txt,Joey,"Rach look, I really don’t think that’s such a great…",27
S08E05 Rachels Date.txt,Rachel,"Okay, you go do it! I’ll come back to that set! I’ll meet more actors! I’ll meet ‘em all!",27
S08E05 Rachels Date.txt,Chandler,Hey Bob.,28

S08E05 Rachels Date.txt,Chandler,"Bob? Ooh, working here with us? Everyday? Yeah, I don’t know if he has what it takes.",30
S08E05 Rachels Date.txt,Chandler,But this is eleven. It’s almost twice as hard up here.,30
S08E05 Rachels Date.txt,Chandler,I think it’s best sir.,30
S08E05 Rachels Date.txt,Chandler,"Y’know what you should do, just toss ‘em in the shedder and claim you never got ‘em.",31
S08E05 Rachels Date.txt,Chandler,What does a guy have to do to be taken seriously around here?!,32

S08E05 Rachels Date.txt,Monica,"Hey. Okay, I gave him another chance, but Tim has got to go!",33
S08E05 Rachels Date.txt,Phoebe,But…,33
S08E05 Rachels Date.txt,Monica,"No! No-no! He is totally incompetent. I called the chef who recommended him to me. He said, ""Ha-ha! Gotcha!""",33
S08E05 Rachels Date.txt,Phoebe,"Okay. Okay, but you can’t fire him today.",33
S08E05 Rachels Date.txt,Monica,Why not?!,33
S08E05 Rachels Date.txt,Phoebe,Because I’m dumping him today.,33
S08E05 Rachels Date.txt,Monica,What?! You said he was sweet!,33
S08E05 Rachels Date.txt,Monica,Just don’t pick up your phone.,34
S08E05 Rachels Date.txt,Monica,What? So now I’m not allowed to fire him?,35
S08E05 Rachels Date.txt,Phoebe,"You can’t fire him and dump him the same day, he’ll kill himself.",35
S08E05 Rachels Date.txt,Monica,"Okay well then, I’ll fire him today and you go out with him for another week.",35
S08E05 Rachels Date.txt,Phoebe,"Are you kidding?! Another week with that sip, I’ll kill myself!",35
S08E05 Rachels Date.txt,Monica,"Okay well, then we’ll both do it today and he’ll just have to deal with it!",35
S08E05 Rachels Date.txt,Phoebe,Okay. But the question is who’s gonna go first. ‘Cause whoever goes second is the bitch.,35
S08E05 Rachels Date.txt,Monica,What do you mean?,35
S08E05 Rachels Date.txt,Phoebe,"Come on! The boss that fires a guy that’s just been dumped, bitch! And the woman who dumps a guy that’s just been fired, blond bitch!",35
S08E05 Rachels Date.txt,Monica,I wanted to do this days ago so I think I should go first.,35
S08E05 Rachels Date.txt,Bob,"Hey Toby, you got a sec?",37

S08E05 Rachels Date.txt,Bob,"I just had a meeting, I was actually hoping to get transferred up here, but I just found out its not gonna happen. Apparently somebody thinks I’m not eleventh floor material. Say uh, who the hell is this Chandler?",37
S08E05 Rachels Date.txt,Rachel,"Hey, what do you think is a better excuse for why I’m not drinking on this date tonight. ""Umm, I’m a recovering alcoholic. I’m a Mormon,"" or ""I got so hammered last night I’m still a little drunk?""",38
S08E05 Rachels Date.txt,Rachel,Hi!,39
S08E05 Rachels Date.txt,Joey,Hey!,39

S08E05 Rachels Date.txt,Ross,A date?,39
S08E05 Rachels Date.txt,Rachel,Yeah. Why? Is that weird for you?,39
S08E05 Rachels Date.txt,Ross,"Why no, it’s the opposite of weird. It’s-it’s uh, regular. It’s-it’s uh, it’s mundane. It’s actually uh, a little dull.",39
S08E05 Rachels Date.txt,Joey,It’s no Ukrainian film.,39
S08E05 Rachels Date.txt,Ross,A date?! She’s-she’s got a date?! With who?,40

S08E05 Rachels Date.txt,Ross,Joey what-what were you thinking?!,40
S08E05 Rachels Date.txt,Joey,"Well, I was thinking that it’d probably be okay because Ross hasn’t gone out with Rachel in five years!",40
S08E05 Rachels Date.txt,Ross,A ferry? My baby is going on a ferry? Do you have any idea how dangerous those are?!,42
S08E05 Rachels Date.txt,Joey,Are we talking about one of those big boats that carry cars that go like five miles an hour?,42
S08E05 Rachels Date.txt,Ross,Why don’t they just jump out of an airplane?! Huh?! That-that’s a fun date! Or burn each other with matches?! That’s fun too! Whew!!,42
S08E05 Rachels Date.txt,Kash,Hey Joey.,43

S08E05 Rachels Date.txt,Tim,It’s because I’m with you.,47
S08E05 Rachels Date.txt,Phoebe,Oh-oh no she doesn’t! I know what that is. You can stay.,50
S08E05 Rachels Date.txt,Joey,So what movie do you want to see—And not another one I have to read. Okay? I get enough of that from books.,52
S08E05 Rachels Date.txt,Ross,Books?,52
S08E05 Rachels Date.txt,Joey,"All right, car magazines, cereal boxes, but it’s like enough!",52
S08E05 Rachels Date.txt,Ross,"Well, I tell you what. Why don’t we uh, why don’t we just stay here? Let’s not see a movie, we’ll just hang.",52
S08E05 Rachels Date.txt,Joey,And just wait for Rachel to come back from her date?,52
S08E05 Rachels Date.txt,Ross,"Hey, if that’s what you want to do I’m not gonna say no.",52
S08E05 Rachels Date.txt,Joey,Dude! What is going on?!,52
S08E05 Rachels Date.txt,Ross,I just…I have to find out how it went.,52
S08E05 Rachels Date.txt,Joey,Why?,52
S08E05 Rachels Date.txt,Ross,This guy could be my baby’s stepfather!,52
S08E05 Rachels Date.txt,Joey,They go on one date and you’re worried about them getting married?! He’s not you!,52
S08E05 Rachels Date.txt,Ross,I just—I-I can’t believe she’s-she’s dating?!,52
S08E05 Rachels Date.txt,Joey,"Well Ross, what did you think she was gonna do?",52
S08E05 Rachels Date.txt,Ross,I don’t know! I guess I just can’t believe any of this is happening.,52
S08E05 Rachels Date.txt,Joey,What do you mean?,52
S08E05 Rachels Date.txt,Ross,"It’s just I always thought when I had another kid it would be different. Now I-I love Ben, but every time I have to drop him off at Carol and Susan’s, it’s like—It breaks my heart a little. I mean I’ve always had this picture of me and my next wife in bed on Sunday and, my kid comes running in and leaps up onto the bed. And we all read the paper together. Y’know? Maybe fight over the science section.",52
S08E05 Rachels Date.txt,Joey,That’s a nice picture. Maybe you can still have that!,52
S08E05 Rachels Date.txt,Ross,No! No I can’t. I mean Rachel’s out with some guy. My baby went with her. If anything that picture keeps moving further away.,52
S08E05 Rachels Date.txt,Joey,"Hey, can I ask you something? In this, in this picture of you and your wife, is your wife Rachel?",52
S08E05 Rachels Date.txt,Ross,It used to be. Now she doesn’t really have a face. Smokin’ body though.,52
S08E05 Rachels Date.txt,Joey,"Good call. Yeah. But, the face Ross, the face isn’t Rachel.",52
S08E05 Rachels Date.txt,Ross,No but ahh! How much easier would it be if it were?,52
S08E05 Rachels Date.txt,Joey,"I know, but I don’t think that’s what she wants.",52
S08E05 Rachels Date.txt,Ross,"No, it’s not what I want either. I mean I-I can’t force myself to fall in love with her again now.",52
S08E05 Rachels Date.txt,Joey,"That’s okay Ross maybe you need a new picture. Okay? It’s not gonna be what you thought, but no matter what there’s gonna be a brand new little baby, your baby. Who cares what the picture looks like?",52
S08E05 Rachels Date.txt,Ross,Yeah.,52
S08E05 Rachels Date.txt,Joey,"Hey, I tell you what. Let’s you and me go out and have some fun. Huh? Whatever you want. Come on!",52
S08E05 Rachels Date.txt,Joey,"No, I said fun!",53

S08E05 Rachels Date.txt,Bob,Toby don’t.,55
S08E05 Rachels Date.txt,Chandler,Bob!,55
S08E05 Rachels Date.txt,Bob,Toby! I’m not gonna let you cover for him. Anything you say right now will just get me more upset with Chandler!,55
S08E05 Rachels Date.txt,Chandler,Well that puts me in a difficult position.,55
S08E05 Rachels Date.txt,Monica,Hey.,56
S08E05 Rachels Date.txt,Tim,"I got your page, is everything okay?",56

S08E05 Rachels Date.txt,Monica,"Yeah and-and I’m sorry too. But, well I just—I like things done a certain way and the chemistry’s just not right.",59
S08E05 Rachels Date.txt,Phoebe,"Oh that’s good, the chemistry thing for us too.",59
S08E05 Rachels Date.txt,Monica,Tim wait!,60
S08E05 Rachels Date.txt,Tim,Yeah?,60

S08E05 Rachels Date.txt,Monica,Yeah.,60
S08E05 Rachels Date.txt,Tim,Thank you so much! ‘Cause I-I know I can do better!,60

S08E05 Rachels Date.txt,Ross,Uh-huh. What happened?,63
S08E05 Rachels Date.txt,Rachel,I made the mistake of telling him that I was pregnant.,63
S08E05 Rachels Date.txt,Ross,"Ah, he didn’t uh, take it so well?",63
S08E05 Rachels Date.txt,Rachel,"Well better than you, but y’know still not what you want.",63
S08E05 Rachels Date.txt,Ross,Oh?,63
S08E05 Rachels Date.txt,Rachel,"He got all weird and sputtery and then he said uh, ""Yeah, I hear those hemorrhoids are a bitch.""",63

S08E05 Rachels Date.txt,Ross,I’m sorry about your date.,66
S08E05 Rachels Date.txt,Rachel,Oh it’s all right. I’m guess I’m just done with the whole dating thing. It’s one more thing in my life that’s suddenly completely different. This is hard.,66
S08E05 Rachels Date.txt,Rachel,Thanks sweetie.,67
S08E05 Rachels Date.txt,Ross,"You wanna, you wanna grab some coffee?",67

S06E04 Joey Loses His Insurance.txt,Ross,What?,5
S06E04 Joey Loses His Insurance.txt,Phoebe,"That she’s gonna move in with you and maybe then she’ll fall in love with you and then when she finds out you’re already married, she’ll just be happy. Y’know? You’re just, you’re very sad.",5
S06E04 Joey Loses His Insurance.txt,Ross,Oh…my…God! I-I see what this is! You are in love with Rachel!,5

S06E04 Joey Loses His Insurance.txt,Ross,"I know! Anyway, they asked me to be a guest lecturer! I mean it’s temporary, but uh, if they like me it could lead to a full time job. How great would that look great on a mailbox, huh? ""Professor Geller.""",12

S06E04 Joey Loses His Insurance.txt,Monica,Phoebe that’s crazy!,15
S06E04 Joey Loses His Insurance.txt,Joey,I can’t believe she would say that too you.,15
S06E04 Joey Loses His Insurance.txt,Rachel,Yeah honey you don’t believe her do you?,15
S06E04 Joey Loses His Insurance.txt,Phoebe,I don’t—she said y’know that I’d have triplets! But she also said one of them would be black.,15
S06E04 Joey Loses His Insurance.txt,Chandler,Just out of curiosity did she tell you how you’re gonna go?,15
S06E04 Joey Loses His Insurance.txt,Chandler,Oh hi!,17

S06E04 Joey Loses His Insurance.txt,Chandler,Why don’t you open with a joke?,22
S06E04 Joey Loses His Insurance.txt,Ross,"Open with a joke? It’s a university, not a comedy club!",22

S06E04 Joey Loses His Insurance.txt,Ross,Please don’t say naked chicks.,23
S06E04 Joey Loses His Insurance.txt,Joey,Why not?!,23
S06E04 Joey Loses His Insurance.txt,Ross,I-I-I don’t even know why I bother to talk to you guys about it. Y’know what? I’m just gonna do it on my own with no naked chicks.,23
S06E04 Joey Loses His Insurance.txt,Chandler,That’s the way I did it ‘til I was 19.,23
S06E04 Joey Loses His Insurance.txt,Chandler,Hey.,24

S06E04 Joey Loses His Insurance.txt,Joey,Hmm that’s weird. I don’t remember being in a move called benefits lapsed.,25
S06E04 Joey Loses His Insurance.txt,Chandler,"Okay, it’s not a check. They’re saying your health insurance expired because, you didn’t work enough last year.",25
S06E04 Joey Loses His Insurance.txt,Joey,Let me see that!,25
S06E04 Joey Loses His Insurance.txt,Chandler,All right.,25

S06E04 Joey Loses His Insurance.txt,Rachel,Monica!,31
S06E04 Joey Loses His Insurance.txt,Rachel,Did-did you take these back?,32

S06E04 Joey Loses His Insurance.txt,Ross,"I knew all I had to do was let the material speak for itself. Everyone’s all, ""Ross you have to be funny and sexy."" Well, I proved them wrong! And now, I’m gonna pass the news onto Joey and Chandler.",34
S06E04 Joey Loses His Insurance.txt,Monica,That you’re not funny or sexy?,34
S06E04 Joey Loses His Insurance.txt,Ross,That’s right!,34

S06E04 Joey Loses His Insurance.txt,Chandler,What’s wrong with you?,38
S06E04 Joey Loses His Insurance.txt,Joey,"Nothing! Well, I-I got this blinding pain in my stomach when I was lifting weights before, then I uh passed out and uh, haven’t been able to stand up since. But um, I don’t think it’s anything serious.",38
S06E04 Joey Loses His Insurance.txt,Chandler,This sounds like a hernia. You have to—you-you go to the doctor!,38
S06E04 Joey Loses His Insurance.txt,Chandler,That’s a hernia.,39

S06E04 Joey Loses His Insurance.txt,Monica,What the hell are you doing?!,45
S06E04 Joey Loses His Insurance.txt,Ross,"Look, I was nervous! You guys had me all worried I was going to be boring! I got up there and they were all like staring at me. I opened my mouth and this British accent just came out.",45

S06E04 Joey Loses His Insurance.txt,Ross,Just please stop!,50
S06E04 Joey Loses His Insurance.txt,Joey,"Dude! Hernia operations cost like, a lot probably. Besides it’s getting darker and more painful, that means it’s healing.",54
S06E04 Joey Loses His Insurance.txt,Chandler,I will loan you the money. Just go to the hospital and let’s just get that thing…pushed back in.,54
S06E04 Joey Loses His Insurance.txt,Joey,"Thank you, but it would take me forever to pay you that money back and I don’t want that hanging over my head. Okay? Besides, as soon as my insurance kicks in I can get all the free operations I want! Yeah, I’m thinking I’ll probably start with that laser eye surgery too.",54
S06E04 Joey Loses His Insurance.txt,Phoebe,Hey!,55
S06E04 Joey Loses His Insurance.txt,Chandler,Hey.,55
S06E04 Joey Loses His Insurance.txt,Joey,Hey!,55

S06E07 Phoebe Runs.txt,Ross,"Look Chandler, Monica is really weird about this kind stuff all right. Believe me, I lived with her for 16 years. She is going to freak…out. Oh my God, she's going to sit on you.",37
S06E07 Phoebe Runs.txt,Chandler,"Hey Mon, how's it going?",39
S06E07 Phoebe Runs.txt,Monica,"Terrible. If-if I want something done right, I have to do it myself. Other people just wreck stuff. I really think I might kill someone tonight.",39
S06E07 Phoebe Runs.txt,Chandler,"Oh come on, come on, it can't be that bad.",39
S06E07 Phoebe Runs.txt,Monica,It's worse. The only thing that's getting me through is knowing that I'm gonna be seeing you soon. I think I may even try to get out of here early.,39

S06E07 Phoebe Runs.txt,Joey,"No-no-no I've seen it happen, you-you get a rapport going with a woman but somehow you manage to kill it. What's your secret?",46
S06E07 Phoebe Runs.txt,Ross,"Look, we do not repel women OK? That is completely untrue.",46
S06E07 Phoebe Runs.txt,Chandler,"Oh no, yes we do my man. Remember when we were back in college and we went to that spring dance and you walked right up to that girl you liked and you could not stop talking about the Irish potato famine?",46
S06E07 Phoebe Runs.txt,Ross,"Yeah, well what about you? You weren't you know, so hot in college either. After everything he said, he'd go ""ba dum bum chessh""",46

S06E07 Phoebe Runs.txt,Ross,"Uh, they don't like it when you correct their grammar.",46
S06E07 Phoebe Runs.txt,Chandler,And they don't like it when you explain why your jokes are funny.,46
S06E07 Phoebe Runs.txt,Ross,They don't like it when you keep asking them if they like you.,46
S06E07 Phoebe Runs.txt,Chandler,"Man, I'm so lucky I have Monica.",46
S06E07 Phoebe Runs.txt,Rachel,"Hey Phoebe, can I talk to you for a second?",48

S06E07 Phoebe Runs.txt,Phoebe,Why do you care?,50
S06E07 Phoebe Runs.txt,Rachel,Because they're people.,50
S06E07 Phoebe Runs.txt,Phoebe,But people that you don't know and will never see again.,50
S06E07 Phoebe Runs.txt,Rachel,"Yes, but still. They're people…with eyes.",50
S06E07 Phoebe Runs.txt,Rachel,"I-I am not uptight—Hey-hey-hey-oh-oh! Listen, I am not uptight, man.",51
S06E07 Phoebe Runs.txt,Chandler,"Okay, is this lamp in the same place?",53
S06E07 Phoebe Runs.txt,Ross,Who cares? I repel women.,53

S06E02 Ross Hugs Rachel.txt,Rachel,Noooooooo!!,15
S06E02 Ross Hugs Rachel.txt,Chandler,"Y’know when we move in together, can I get a gumball machine?",16
S06E02 Ross Hugs Rachel.txt,Monica,Of course! Joey wouldn’t let you have one?,16
S06E02 Ross Hugs Rachel.txt,Chandler,"No. When it comes to sweets, he’s surprisingly strict.",16
S06E02 Ross Hugs Rachel.txt,Monica,"Hey, have you figured out a way to tell him you’re moving out?",16
S06E02 Ross Hugs Rachel.txt,Chandler,"No, no, I keep trying, y’know? I can get out, ""Joey, I have too…"" but then I lose my nerve and I always finish with, ""…go to the bathroom."" He may think I’m sick.",16
S06E02 Ross Hugs Rachel.txt,Monica,"Y’know, I really have to tell Rachel, but I… We just have to get it over with! Y’know, the next time we see them we’re just gonna tell them. Okay? That’s it.",16
S06E02 Ross Hugs Rachel.txt,Chandler,"Oh, so that’s this is gonna work now? You’re just gonna order me around all the time?",16
S06E02 Ross Hugs Rachel.txt,Monica,Pretty much.,16
S06E02 Ross Hugs Rachel.txt,Chandler,All right.,16
S06E02 Ross Hugs Rachel.txt,Monica,Hi!,17
S06E02 Ross Hugs Rachel.txt,Monica,"Joey, we have something to tell you.",18

S06E02 Ross Hugs Rachel.txt,Monica,Wait! Joey! Joey! Are you okay?!,20
S06E02 Ross Hugs Rachel.txt,Chandler,"Look, I-I’m just gonna be right across the hall and I promise you, the minute Monica and I break up I’m moving right back in with you!",21
S06E02 Ross Hugs Rachel.txt,Monica,Hey Pheebs!,23
S06E02 Ross Hugs Rachel.txt,Phoebe,Hey!,23
S06E02 Ross Hugs Rachel.txt,Monica,"Hey, have you seen Rachel?",23

S06E02 Ross Hugs Rachel.txt,Monica,I have some pretty exciting news!,23
S06E02 Ross Hugs Rachel.txt,Monica,No! Chandler and I are moving in together!,24
S06E02 Ross Hugs Rachel.txt,Phoebe,"Ooh! That’s good! Wow! But now if you were pregnant, what would you name it? Hint: Phoebe.",24
S06E02 Ross Hugs Rachel.txt,Ross,Hey! Hi!,25
S06E02 Ross Hugs Rachel.txt,Monica,Hey!,25
S06E02 Ross Hugs Rachel.txt,Ross,What’s up?,25

S06E02 Ross Hugs Rachel.txt,Phoebe,"Guys, I’m happy too.",26
S06E02 Ross Hugs Rachel.txt,Ross,Bye.,29
S06E02 Ross Hugs Rachel.txt,Phoebe,"Hmm, something bad to tell Rachel… Bad news for Rachel, what could that be?!",29
S06E02 Ross Hugs Rachel.txt,Ross,"Could ya just, could ya just lay off, please? All right? My life is an embarrassment! I should go live under somebody’s stairs!",29
S06E02 Ross Hugs Rachel.txt,Phoebe,"Ross, it’s not that big a deal! So you’ll been divorced three times, you’ll still have a life, you’ll go on dates…",29
S06E02 Ross Hugs Rachel.txt,Phoebe,"Ross, you’re being ridiculous! Okay? You are cute and smart and sweet and that is much more important than three stupid divorces!",30
S06E02 Ross Hugs Rachel.txt,Ross,Oh yeah? Have you ever dated anyone who has been divorced three times?,30
S06E02 Ross Hugs Rachel.txt,Phoebe,"Y’know that’s really fair. Y’know? Most guys who have been divorced three times are like 60. Ross, nobody cares about this except you! This-this embarrassment thing is all in your head! Here, I’ll show you! Come here.",30
S06E02 Ross Hugs Rachel.txt,Ross,What?! Why?,30
S06E02 Ross Hugs Rachel.txt,Monica,"Ugh, I thought you were Rachel!",35
S06E02 Ross Hugs Rachel.txt,Monica,"I just tell her, I have to get it over with. I told Ross and Phoebe and she’s the only one left!",36
S06E02 Ross Hugs Rachel.txt,Chandler,"Okay, so that’s it, everybody knows! It’s official, we’re moving in together. No turning back. Are ya scared? Are ya?",36
S06E02 Ross Hugs Rachel.txt,Monica,No.,36
S06E02 Ross Hugs Rachel.txt,Chandler,Wow that was my scariest voice! You’re very brave.,36
S06E02 Ross Hugs Rachel.txt,Rachel,Hey!,37
S06E02 Ross Hugs Rachel.txt,Chandler,Hey.,37
S06E02 Ross Hugs Rachel.txt,Rachel,"Ugh, the worse day! Y’know, you think you’re making progress at work and then your boss calls you Raquel.",37
S06E02 Ross Hugs Rachel.txt,Rachel,"I believe you. So, it was right in the middle of a staff meeting so of course no one else wants to correct her so everyone else is calling me Raquel! By the end of the day, the mailroom guys were calling me Rocky!",38
S06E02 Ross Hugs Rachel.txt,Chandler,"Well, I-I still think you’re very-very nice and very pretty…",38
S06E02 Ross Hugs Rachel.txt,Rachel,What?,38
S06E02 Ross Hugs Rachel.txt,Rachel,Oh my God! That’s so great! I’m so happy for you guys!,40
S06E02 Ross Hugs Rachel.txt,Monica,Really?!,40
S06E02 Ross Hugs Rachel.txt,Rachel,"And that was so sweet of you to ask! Oh my God, the three of us are gonna have such a good time living together!",40
S06E02 Ross Hugs Rachel.txt,Rachel,"And Chandler, you’re gonna have to watch those long showers you take in the morning because you know Raquel can’t be late.",41
S06E02 Ross Hugs Rachel.txt,Chandler,Rach…,41
S06E02 Ross Hugs Rachel.txt,Monica,"Yeah, he’s gonna work on that.",41
S06E02 Ross Hugs Rachel.txt,Ross,"…once you know the stories, it’s not that bad. First marriage, wife’s hidden sexuality, not my fault. Second marriage, said the wrong name at the altar, a little my fault. Third marriage, well they really shouldn’t allow you to get married when you’re that drunk and have writing all over your face, Nevada’s fault.",44
S06E02 Ross Hugs Rachel.txt,Phoebe,"Okay, so what do you think ladies? Who wouldn’t be interested? Who wouldn’t want to date him?",44
S06E02 Ross Hugs Rachel.txt,Stephanie,"Well the divorces don’t bother me, I’d date him. But, not while he’s still married.",44
S06E02 Ross Hugs Rachel.txt,Karin,"Actually, I’m dating at all anymore. See, I figured out that I was only dating guys that were like y’know bad for me, so until I work that out…",45
S06E02 Ross Hugs Rachel.txt,Meg,"Well, I don’t care about the divorces either, but I wouldn’t date him. It’s just that he’s obviously still in love with this Rachel girl.",46
S06E02 Ross Hugs Rachel.txt,Ross,What?!,46
S06E02 Ross Hugs Rachel.txt,Ross,"This is crazy! I mean, yes-yes Rachel is my good friend and I-I have loved her in the past, but now, she is just my wife! Phoebe, will you-will you help me out here?",47
S06E02 Ross Hugs Rachel.txt,Phoebe,"Well, I thought you loved her when you-when you married her.",47
S06E02 Ross Hugs Rachel.txt,Ross,"We were drunk! I would’ve married uh, Joey with that amount of alcohol!",47
S06E02 Ross Hugs Rachel.txt,Phoebe,Hey! You could do a lot worse than Joey Tribbiani!!,47
S06E02 Ross Hugs Rachel.txt,Phoebe,"Yes, and now he’s using this three divorces reason because he wants to stay married to her because he loves her. I must say, ""Well done!"" Bravo Meg.",48
S06E02 Ross Hugs Rachel.txt,Meg,Okay now I wouldn’t date you because you seem a little creepy.,49
S06E02 Ross Hugs Rachel.txt,Karin,I am so attracted to him right now.,49
S06E02 Ross Hugs Rachel.txt,Chandler,"Okay, when are we gonna tell Rachel what is actually gonna happen?",50
S06E02 Ross Hugs Rachel.txt,Monica,"Soon! I-I just couldn’t before. You saw how upset Joey got! I couldn’t do that to her, she’s my best friend!",50
S06E02 Ross Hugs Rachel.txt,Chandler,"Well, Joey’s my best friend.",50
S06E02 Ross Hugs Rachel.txt,Monica,I’m not your best friend?,50
S06E02 Ross Hugs Rachel.txt,Chandler,You just said… Of course you’re my best friend. Would you please tell Rachel though?,50
S06E02 Ross Hugs Rachel.txt,Monica,"All right, all right, at least I’m prepared.",50
S06E02 Ross Hugs Rachel.txt,Chandler,Hey-hey!,52
S06E02 Ross Hugs Rachel.txt,Monica,These aren’t for you! Are you upset?,52
S06E02 Ross Hugs Rachel.txt,Chandler,I am now!,52
S06E02 Ross Hugs Rachel.txt,Monica,"Rach, there’s something uh, important I have to tell you.",54
S06E02 Ross Hugs Rachel.txt,Monica,"No! But, I’m throwing this shirt away! I think there was a little misunderstanding before.",55
S06E02 Ross Hugs Rachel.txt,Rachel,Um-hmm.,55
S06E02 Ross Hugs Rachel.txt,Monica,"Umm, when I said that uh, that Chandler and I wanted to umm, live together we meant alone together.",55
S06E02 Ross Hugs Rachel.txt,Monica,"Oh no sweetie, no! This is my fault, I wasn’t clear! I’m really sorry. And listen, you take as much time as you need to move out okay? There’s absolutely no rush.",56
S06E02 Ross Hugs Rachel.txt,Monica,Okay. Don’t you want a cookie?,57
S06E02 Ross Hugs Rachel.txt,Monica,"Maybe, do you need a tissue?",58
S06E02 Ross Hugs Rachel.txt,Rachel,"Monica, where did you get these?!",59
S06E02 Ross Hugs Rachel.txt,Monica,I made them!,59
S06E02 Ross Hugs Rachel.txt,Joey,"God, it’s gonna so weird like when I come home and you’re not here. Y’know? No more Joey and Chan’s. No more J and C’s. ""You wanna go over to Joey and Chandler’s?"" ""Can’t, its not there.""",61
S06E02 Ross Hugs Rachel.txt,Chandler,"Look, I’m just gonna be across the hall, we can still do all the same stuff.",61
S06E02 Ross Hugs Rachel.txt,Joey,Yeah but we won’t be able to like get up in the middle of the night and have those long talks about our feelings and the future.,61
S06E02 Ross Hugs Rachel.txt,Chandler,Not once did we do that.,61
S06E02 Ross Hugs Rachel.txt,Chandler,Hey!,62
S06E02 Ross Hugs Rachel.txt,Joey,Hi.,62
S06E02 Ross Hugs Rachel.txt,Monica,"So I, I told Rachel it was just gonna be the two of us.",62
S06E02 Ross Hugs Rachel.txt,Chandler,"Oh yeah? Well, how’d she take it?",62
S06E02 Ross Hugs Rachel.txt,Chandler,And you’re upset because you didn’t make your best friend cry?,63
S06E02 Ross Hugs Rachel.txt,Monica,"I mean, all I’m asking for is just a little emotion! Is that too much to ask after six years?! I mean what? Are-are-are Rachel and I not as close as you guys?! I mean do we not have as much fun?! Don’t I deserve a few tears?!! I mean we-we told Joey, he cried his eyes out!",63
S06E02 Ross Hugs Rachel.txt,Joey,Hey! I did not cry my eyes out!! Come on! It’s like the end of an era! No more J-man and Channie’s!!,63
S06E02 Ross Hugs Rachel.txt,Chandler,"Okay, I gotta ask, who calls us that?!",63
S06E02 Ross Hugs Rachel.txt,Russell,You got married again.,64
S06E02 Ross Hugs Rachel.txt,Ross,Yes.,64
S06E02 Ross Hugs Rachel.txt,Russell,So that’s your second marriage in two years.,64
S06E02 Ross Hugs Rachel.txt,Ross,"Yes, second in two years. Third overall.",64
S06E02 Ross Hugs Rachel.txt,Russell,"Ross, I have been a divorce attorney for 23 years and never had I so much business from one client. Why don’t you tell me what happened.",64
S06E02 Ross Hugs Rachel.txt,Ross,"Basically, Rachel and I were in Vegas and we got drunk…",64
S06E02 Ross Hugs Rachel.txt,Ross,"Yes-yes-yes! But, I-I do not love her.",65
S06E02 Ross Hugs Rachel.txt,Russell,"Oh, that’s better then.",65
S06E02 Ross Hugs Rachel.txt,Ross,This was just a drunken mistake and I need to get it annulled.,65
S06E02 Ross Hugs Rachel.txt,Russell,I see. Have you considered therapy?,65
S06E02 Ross Hugs Rachel.txt,Ross,I think just the annulment for today.,65
S06E02 Ross Hugs Rachel.txt,Russell,There are a couple of forms to fill out.,65
S06E02 Ross Hugs Rachel.txt,Ross,Easy.,65
S06E02 Ross Hugs Rachel.txt,Russell,"And we’ll need to have witnesses who can testify that you were not of uh, sound mind.",65
S06E02 Ross Hugs Rachel.txt,Ross,No problem.,65
S06E02 Ross Hugs Rachel.txt,Russell,And we’ll need you and Rachel to testify before a judge.,65
S06E02 Ross Hugs Rachel.txt,Ross,"Ooh! There’s no way to do this without her? ‘Cause I kinda all ready told her uh, it was, it was already taken care of.",65
S06E02 Ross Hugs Rachel.txt,Russell,"Of course you did. Look Ross, you can’t get an annulment unless you and Rachel are both there.",65
S06E02 Ross Hugs Rachel.txt,Rachel,Hey!,67
S06E02 Ross Hugs Rachel.txt,Monica,"Hey. So um, I was thinking that maybe we should start dividing up our stuff.",67
S06E02 Ross Hugs Rachel.txt,Rachel,Okay!,67
S06E02 Ross Hugs Rachel.txt,Monica,"Y’know, no point in dragging it out. Dragging out the long process of you moving out and us not living together anymore.",67
S06E02 Ross Hugs Rachel.txt,Rachel,Okay.,67
S06E02 Ross Hugs Rachel.txt,Rachel,"Wow! Mon, thanks! I love this plate!",70
S06E02 Ross Hugs Rachel.txt,Monica,Something to remember me by!,70
S06E02 Ross Hugs Rachel.txt,Rachel,"Mon, honey you’re not dying. I’m just moving out. Y’know, I mean we’re gonna see each other all the time.",70
S06E02 Ross Hugs Rachel.txt,Monica,"But still, it’s a big change. The end of an era, you might say!",70
S06E02 Ross Hugs Rachel.txt,Rachel,Are you okay? You’re not blinking.,70
S06E02 Ross Hugs Rachel.txt,Monica,"I’m fine! I just, I’m thinking how much it’s an end of era.",70
S06E02 Ross Hugs Rachel.txt,Rachel,"Oh, all right. But y’know I gotta say, I don’t, I don’t think six years counts as an era.",70
S06E02 Ross Hugs Rachel.txt,Monica,"An era is defined as a significant period of time. Now, it was significant to me, maybe it wasn’t significant to you!",70
S06E02 Ross Hugs Rachel.txt,Rachel,What is the matter with you?!,70
S06E02 Ross Hugs Rachel.txt,Monica,What is the matter with you?!! Why aren’t you more upset?! Aren’t you gonna be sad that we’re not gonna be living together anymore?! I mean aren’t you gonna miss me at all?!,70
S06E02 Ross Hugs Rachel.txt,Rachel,"All right, fine, but don’t get mad at me. It’s-it’s just a little hard to believe.",70
S06E02 Ross Hugs Rachel.txt,Monica,What’s hard to believe?,70
S06E02 Ross Hugs Rachel.txt,Rachel,"Well y’know, it’s you guys. You-you do this kind of stuff! Y’know? I mean, you-you were gonna get married in Vegas and then you backed out! I guess I’m not upset because I don’t see you guys going through with it. I’m sorry.",70
S06E02 Ross Hugs Rachel.txt,Monica,"Rachel, it’s going to happen. Chandler is gonna move in here.",70
S06E02 Ross Hugs Rachel.txt,Rachel,But I…,70
S06E02 Ross Hugs Rachel.txt,Monica,"No-no, wait! Just let me finish, okay? This isn’t something that we just, we just impulsively decided in-in Vegas, this is something we both really want. And it is going to happen.",70
S06E02 Ross Hugs Rachel.txt,Rachel,It is? Really?,70
S06E02 Ross Hugs Rachel.txt,Monica,"Yeah, sweetie.",70
S06E02 Ross Hugs Rachel.txt,Monica,No.,71
S06E02 Ross Hugs Rachel.txt,Rachel,I mean it’s the end of an era!,73
S06E02 Ross Hugs Rachel.txt,Monica,I know!,73
S06E02 Ross Hugs Rachel.txt,Ross,Oh no.,75
S06E02 Ross Hugs Rachel.txt,Phoebe,So? Did you get the annulment?,75
S06E02 Ross Hugs Rachel.txt,Ross,I couldn’t.,75
S06E02 Ross Hugs Rachel.txt,Phoebe,I knew it! Because you love Rachel.,75
S06E02 Ross Hugs Rachel.txt,Ross,It’s not that. Okay? Annulments are more complicated than I…,75
S06E02 Ross Hugs Rachel.txt,Phoebe,"Yeah, complicated ‘cause of the love.",75
S06E02 Ross Hugs Rachel.txt,Ross,"I… I do, I do not love Rachel. I’m gonna tell her right now about the whole thing so we can get this marriage annulled as fast as possible. Okay? Would I do that if I loved her?",75
S06E02 Ross Hugs Rachel.txt,Phoebe,I’ve never been more convinced of your love for her.,75
S06E02 Ross Hugs Rachel.txt,Ross,"Ohh, what’s wrong?!",77
S06E02 Ross Hugs Rachel.txt,Rachel,Monica and Chandler are really moving in here and I have to move out and everything is changing.,77
S06E02 Ross Hugs Rachel.txt,Rachel,Thank you.,78
S06E02 Ross Hugs Rachel.txt,Ross,Of course.,78
S06E02 Ross Hugs Rachel.txt,Joey,"So, Ross and Rachel got married, Monica and Chandler almost got married, do you think you and I should hook up?",80
S06E02 Ross Hugs Rachel.txt,Phoebe,"Oh we do, but not just yet.",80
S06E02 Ross Hugs Rachel.txt,Joey,"Really?! Well, when?",80
S06E02 Ross Hugs Rachel.txt,Phoebe,"Okay umm, well, first Chandler and Monica will get married and be filthy rich by the way. Yeah. But it won’t work out.",80
S06E02 Ross Hugs Rachel.txt,Joey,Wow.,80
S06E02 Ross Hugs Rachel.txt,Phoebe,"I know. Then, I’m gonna marry Chandler for the money and you’ll marry Rachel and have the beautiful kids.",80
S06E02 Ross Hugs Rachel.txt,Joey,Great!,80
S06E02 Ross Hugs Rachel.txt,Phoebe,But then we ditch those two and that’s when we get married. We’ll have Chandler’s money and Rachel’s kids and getting custody will be easy because of Rachel’s drinking problem.,80
S06E02 Ross Hugs Rachel.txt,Joey,"Oh-oh, what about Ross?",80
S06E02 Ross Hugs Rachel.txt,Phoebe,"I don’t want to go into the whole thing, but umm, we have words and I kill him.",80
S10E04 The Cake.txt,Chandler,"Honey, I got us that room at the Woodford Inn this weekend.",3
S10E04 The Cake.txt,Monica,That place in Vermont? You can take a hint!,3
S10E04 The Cake.txt,Rachel,"Wait, you can't go away this weekend! It's Emma's birthday!",3
S10E04 The Cake.txt,Ross,Yeah!,3
S10E04 The Cake.txt,Rachel,We're having a party.,3
S10E04 The Cake.txt,Monica,"Well, can't you just have the party when we get back?",3
S10E04 The Cake.txt,Ross,No.,3
S10E04 The Cake.txt,Rachel,"No, that day... that won't be her real birthday!",3
S10E04 The Cake.txt,Chandler,Gee if only she were one and had no idea what the hell a birthday was!,3
S10E04 The Cake.txt,Ross,"C'mon you guys, this is really important to us.",3
S10E04 The Cake.txt,Monica,"Well, I'm sorry, but Chandler and I could really use a weekend away. You know, to reconnect... emotionally.",3
S10E04 The Cake.txt,Chandler,There's this thing I really want us to do. I read about it in Maxim...,3
S10E04 The Cake.txt,Rachel,"Well, can't you just go to Vermont the next day?",3
S10E04 The Cake.txt,Ross,"Yeah, we want everyone to be there. As much as I hate to delay your doing weird sex stuff to my little sister.",3
S10E04 The Cake.txt,Rachel,"And I mean, you know, you guys... This is a big deal. I mean, how can we have her first birthday party without her aunt and her uncle!",3
S10E04 The Cake.txt,Monica,"All right, we'll stay. We can just drive up after the party.",3
S10E04 The Cake.txt,Chandler,"Fine, but if we end up not doing this Maxim thing because of this party...",3
S10E04 The Cake.txt,Monica,"Believe me, that is not why we won't be doing that!",3
S10E04 The Cake.txt,Rachel,"You know Pheebs, when I was little, on my birthday, my daddy would hide a present in every room of the house, and then he would draw a treasure map to help me find 'em all.",4
S10E04 The Cake.txt,Phoebe,"Oooh, I love family traditions like that. When uhm... when Ursula and I were kids, on our birthday, our stepdad would sell his blood to buy us food!",4
S10E04 The Cake.txt,Ross,"Hey, I brought the camera for Emma's video.",5
S10E04 The Cake.txt,Rachel,"Oh, good, good! We had this idea to make a birthday video for Emma and we'll give it to her when she is 18.",5
S10E04 The Cake.txt,Phoebe,"Oh, COOL!! Wow, it's like a time capsule!",5
S10E04 The Cake.txt,Ross,Yeah!,5
S10E04 The Cake.txt,Phoebe,"Oh, just think... she's gonna be watching that video on a TV that hasn't even been invented yet! With friends who right now are just like babies! And they'll be living in a floating city that the humans built to escape the ant people!",5
S10E04 The Cake.txt,Ross,"That's the hope! So, is Emma awake yet?",5
S10E04 The Cake.txt,Rachel,"Oh no, it's still nap time. But she'll be up soon.",5
S10E04 The Cake.txt,Ross,"Ah, and where is Joey?",5
S10E04 The Cake.txt,Rachel,I said it's still nap time.,5
S10E04 The Cake.txt,Joey,Hey!,7
S10E04 The Cake.txt,Ross,"Hey, say something to Emma on her 18th birthday!",7
S10E04 The Cake.txt,Ross,"Joey, NO!",8
S10E04 The Cake.txt,Joey,"What, what!? it's for her hot friends!",8
S10E04 The Cake.txt,Ross,When they see this you'll be 52!,8
S10E04 The Cake.txt,Joey,And starting to think about settling down!,8
S10E04 The Cake.txt,Rachel,"Hey Joey, will you please set this up for people to put Emma's presents on?",8
S10E04 The Cake.txt,Joey,I'd love to! Yeah!,8
S10E04 The Cake.txt,Phoebe,Yeah! I wrote Emma a song.,9
S10E04 The Cake.txt,Joey,"Oh, yeah! How was I supposed to know?",9
S10E04 The Cake.txt,Phoebe,"Joey, it's a birthday party.",9
S10E04 The Cake.txt,Monica,Hey!,11
S10E04 The Cake.txt,Chandler,Hey hey! Where's the birthday girl?,11
S10E04 The Cake.txt,Rachel,"Oh, she's still napping",11
S10E04 The Cake.txt,Chandler,"Oh, sure, she was probably up all night, excited about the party she knows is happening.",11
S10E04 The Cake.txt,Rachel,"Look, I know that you guys really want to get to Vermont and this isn't a really big deal to you, but it really is to us, ok? Emma will never have a first birthday again.",11
S10E04 The Cake.txt,Monica,All right... you're right. We're sorry. Now let's wake up Emma and get the fun time started!,11
S10E04 The Cake.txt,Rachel,"No really, she didn't sleep well last night, so we can't wake her up.",11
S10E04 The Cake.txt,Monica,"Are you freaking kidding me, Green?",11
S10E04 The Cake.txt,Monica,So glad you came!,13
S10E04 The Cake.txt,Jack,I can't believe Emma is already one!,13
S10E04 The Cake.txt,Joey,Hey Mr. and Mrs. Geller! Let me help you with that.,15
S10E04 The Cake.txt,Jack,Thank you!,15
S10E04 The Cake.txt,Joey,"Oh man, this is great, uh? The three of us together again! You know what would be fun? If we gave this present to Emma from all of us!",15
S10E04 The Cake.txt,Jack,Which one are you?,15
S10E04 The Cake.txt,Monica,I can't believe Emma is still asleep!,16
S10E04 The Cake.txt,Chandler,"I know, what are we gonna do?",16
S10E04 The Cake.txt,Monica,I've got a plan. I've got a plan. I'm going to ram this platter really hard into your ribs. You're gonna scream out and that'll wake her up!,16
S10E04 The Cake.txt,Chandler,I'm not going to Vermont with this Monica!,16
S10E04 The Cake.txt,Joey,"Hey Pheebs, you know what? I was thinking... since you wrote a song, maybe I could do something for Emma using my talents!",16
S10E04 The Cake.txt,Phoebe,So you’re gonna... hit on her?,16
S10E04 The Cake.txt,Joey,"No, no, no! My talents as an actor!",16
S10E04 The Cake.txt,Phoebe,Oh!,16
S10E04 The Cake.txt,Joey,"You know, I could like maybe... I could do a dramatic reading of one of her books!",16
S10E04 The Cake.txt,Phoebe,Or you could stick a fork in an apple!,16
S10E04 The Cake.txt,Joey,"Hey, I think Emma might like it!",16
S10E04 The Cake.txt,Rachel,Oh! Emma might like what?,16
S10E04 The Cake.txt,Joey,"Um, my present!",16
S10E04 The Cake.txt,Rachel,What did you get her?,16
S10E04 The Cake.txt,Joey,Actually we prepared performances.,16
S10E04 The Cake.txt,Phoebe,Separate performances.,16
S10E04 The Cake.txt,Joey,But equally real!,16
S10E04 The Cake.txt,Rachel,"Well, this sounds like fun! Well, you know what? Actually? People are getting a little antsy waiting Emma to wake up from her nap, so would you mind performing them once now?",16
S10E04 The Cake.txt,Phoebe,"Sure, yeah!",16
S10E04 The Cake.txt,Ross,"Oh, great!",18
S10E04 The Cake.txt,Joey,"Hey, I do it every week with three cameras pointed at me and a whole crew waiting!",19
S10E04 The Cake.txt,Rachel,"So, Joey, what are you gonna do for us?",19
S10E04 The Cake.txt,Joey,I will be doing a dramatic reading of one of Emma’s books.,19
S10E04 The Cake.txt,Rachel,"Oh, ok, which one?",19

S10E04 The Cake.txt,Judy,"Yes, you’ll be all grown up by then. We’ll be... Well your grandfather and I might not be here.",25
S10E04 The Cake.txt,Jack,"That’s true! This message could becoming to you from beyond the grave, Emma!",25
S10E04 The Cake.txt,Judy,"After all, my parents died very young.",25
S10E04 The Cake.txt,Jack,And my cholesterol’s off the charts!,25
S10E04 The Cake.txt,Judy,"Remember, Emma, heart disease kills women too!",25

S10E04 The Cake.txt,Ross,Sure.,26
S10E04 The Cake.txt,Rachel,"Oh, you're gonna love this cake. I got it from a bakery in New Jersey, Corino’s.",26
S10E04 The Cake.txt,Monica,"Oh my God, that place has the creamiest frosting! I use to hitchhike there when I was a kid.",26
S10E04 The Cake.txt,Rachel,"Well, anyway, they make these great novelty cakes, in all different shapes, and if you give them a photo, they’ll copy it in icing!",26
S10E04 The Cake.txt,Monica,"Oh, did you do a picture of Emma?",26
S10E04 The Cake.txt,Rachel,Yes! On a cake shaped like a bunny.,26
S10E04 The Cake.txt,Ross,"Uh, Rach? Does this bakery by any chance also bake erotic cakes? Say for bachelorette parties?",26
S10E04 The Cake.txt,Rachel,"Why you guys this isn't funny, all right? If I wanted this cake to be a disaster I would have baked it myself!",28
S10E04 The Cake.txt,Jack,"I know what you're thinking Judy, the resemblance is uncanny!",30
S10E04 The Cake.txt,Ross,I am this close to tugging on my testicles again.,30
S10E04 The Cake.txt,Joey,I'm so confused!,33
S10E04 The Cake.txt,Chandler,To be fair this one does have nuts.,34
S10E04 The Cake.txt,Ross,"Hey Mon, that was really nice of you to loan Rachel your car so she could go and get the cake.",36
S10E04 The Cake.txt,Monica,"Oh. So nice of her to pull my hair, 'till I dropped the key!",36
S10E04 The Cake.txt,Chandler,Hi Emma! It's the year 2020. Are you still enjoying your nap?,37
S10E04 The Cake.txt,Monica,"We're Aunt Monica and uncle Chandler, by the way. You may not recognize us, because we haven't spoken to your parents in seventeen years!",37
S10E04 The Cake.txt,Monica,"Ross, Rachel promised it would be over by now. We seriously have to go, if we want to get to Vermont. I called them and the last train leaves in a half hour.",38
S10E04 The Cake.txt,Phoebe,"And you know, I have a massage client soon.",38
S10E04 The Cake.txt,Ross,"You guys, just please.. a little bit longer. I promise, Rachel will be back with the cake any minute. Monica, remember.. the frosting? huh?",38

S10E04 The Cake.txt,Chandler,Was that Emma? Is she up?,40

S10E04 The Cake.txt,Phoebe,"Well, if you're leaving, I'm definitely gonna go.",40
S10E04 The Cake.txt,Ross,"No, wait ! You guys, no, no, you can't leave! Rachel already feels bad that the cake's messed up. How do you think she's gonna feel when she comes back here and all you guys are gone?",41
S10E04 The Cake.txt,Chandler,I don't know! You'll tell us on Monday!,41
S10E04 The Cake.txt,Chandler,To the bathroom!,43

S10E04 The Cake.txt,Joey,No.,46
S10E04 The Cake.txt,Judy,"Well, we better get going, it's late. Jack's not allowed to drive at night anymore. He has trouble staying in his lane.",46
S10E04 The Cake.txt,Jack,Last winter I went up on a church lawn and drove right through a manger scene. The papers thought it was a hate crime.,46
S10E04 The Cake.txt,Judy,"Anyway, it was lovely seeing you.",46
S10E04 The Cake.txt,Judy,Bye... Bye dear.,47
S10E04 The Cake.txt,Joey,Nighty-night!,47

S10E04 The Cake.txt,Monica,"No, he didn't! He pretended to be a Quaker to get out of Korea.",47
S10E04 The Cake.txt,Chandler,"You do know, I can just turn them the other way around, right?",48
S10E04 The Cake.txt,Joey,Oh! I forgot you used to live here!,48

S10E04 The Cake.txt,Monica,"Yeah, and we've paid for a room, that we're supposed to be in right now!",54
S10E04 The Cake.txt,Phoebe,"Well, oh, ok now... Only one of us has to stay with Emma. Ok, and as the person who realized that, I get to go!",54
S10E04 The Cake.txt,Monica,No! no! Let's figure out a fair way to decide who's staying.,54
S10E04 The Cake.txt,Joey,"Oh! I got it! Ok, everyone pick a number from one to ten. Alright? Whoever gets the highest number gets to go first.",54
S10E04 The Cake.txt,Joey,"Okay, Monica picks ten, I call nine! Anyone else?",55
S10E04 The Cake.txt,Phoebe,"No, lets just draw straws.",55
S10E04 The Cake.txt,Joey,"Or.. we could flip a coin, and then multiply the..",55
S10E04 The Cake.txt,Chandler,I'm begging you stop.,55
S10E04 The Cake.txt,Joey,Right.,55
S10E04 The Cake.txt,Monica,"Ok, how about this: We got wind up toys for Emma for her birthday. We can make them race, and whoever comes in last, stays!",55
S10E04 The Cake.txt,Phoebe,Ok! I want the dolphin!,58
S10E04 The Cake.txt,Chandler,Thats a bear.,58
S10E04 The Cake.txt,Phoebe,I'm too excited!,58

S10E04 The Cake.txt,Rachel,Emma's awake.,73
S10E04 The Cake.txt,Ross,Yeah?,73
S10E04 The Cake.txt,Rachel,I can't believe this. This is her first birthday. She's awake. We're not even there. Everybody left. We still have this stupid obscene cake.,73
S10E04 The Cake.txt,Rachel,"Oh, why do you even bother? I already ruined her first birthday... And do you know how important these early experiences are Ross? Very! According to the back cover of that book that you gave me.",74
S10E04 The Cake.txt,Ross,"Rach, she's not going to remember this.",74
S10E04 The Cake.txt,Rachel,What?,76
S10E04 The Cake.txt,Ross,It's not bad.,76
S10E04 The Cake.txt,Ross,"Well, I just made these two things uhm... cheeks. And then I split this to make ears.",77
S10E04 The Cake.txt,Rachel,"Well, I'm very impressed.",77
S10E04 The Cake.txt,Ross,"Some can sing, some can dance. I apparently can turn phallic cakes into woodland creatures.",77
S10E04 The Cake.txt,Monica,"Now another way to organise your stuffed animals, is by size.",78
S10E04 The Cake.txt,Chandler,"I'm sorry, is this a game for Emma or for Monica?",78
S10E04 The Cake.txt,Monica,Game?,78
S10E04 The Cake.txt,Chandler,"Emma, you even know it's your birthday today? You're one! One-year-old, that's little.",78
S10E04 The Cake.txt,Chandler,Ooh! That's my girl!,79
S10E04 The Cake.txt,Monica,That's how old you are.,79
S10E04 The Cake.txt,Chandler,Did I teach her that? Did I just... impart wisdom?,79
S10E04 The Cake.txt,Chandler,Me too...,80
S10E04 The Cake.txt,Chandler,There's no-one around. Why don't we just take this one?,81
S10E04 The Cake.txt,Monica,...and head to Canada!,81
S10E04 The Cake.txt,Chandler,I was kidding.,81
S10E04 The Cake.txt,Monica,I wasn't. Let's get going!,81

S10E04 The Cake.txt,Phoebe,"Oh good, I didn't miss the party.",82
S10E04 The Cake.txt,Monica,What about your massage client?,82
S10E04 The Cake.txt,Phoebe,"I just felt so bad, missing this. So I just slipped him a little something, you know. As long as I'm back in five or six hours, it will be alright.",82
S10E04 The Cake.txt,Joey,"Okay, if Ross and Rachel ask, I've been here the whole time. THE WHOLE TIME!",83
S10E04 The Cake.txt,Ross,"Joey, we just saw you come in. You ran past us on the stairs.",85
S10E04 The Cake.txt,Rachel,I don't care that you left. I'm just glad that you're here. Thanks you guys!,85

S10E04 The Cake.txt,Rachel,"Oh yeah, nothing! These are happy tears! This is just what I wanted.",90
S10E04 The Cake.txt,Joey,What is wrong with me. It looked more delicious when it was a penis.,91
S10E04 The Cake.txt,Rachel,Okay.,92
S10E04 The Cake.txt,Ross,"Okay, you ready?",92
S10E04 The Cake.txt,Rachel,Yeah.,92
S10E04 The Cake.txt,Ross,A-a-and... record.,92
S03E16 The Morning After.txt,Ross,"I mean, I don’t feel like I even have a girlfriend anymore.",4
S03E16 The Morning After.txt,Rachel,You want me to just quit my job so that you can feel like you’ve got a girlfriend?,4
S03E16 The Morning After.txt,Ross,Is this about Mark?,4
S03E16 The Morning After.txt,Ross,"Okay, it’s not, it’s not.",5
S03E16 The Morning After.txt,Rachel,"Oh my God. I cannot keep having this same fight with you Ross! Look, urrgh, maybe we should take a break.",5
S03E16 The Morning After.txt,Rachel,No. A break from us.,6
S03E16 The Morning After.txt,Rachel,"Then, we had this big, stupid fight, and I said I wanted to take a break, I don’t want to take a break.",8
S03E16 The Morning After.txt,Mark,"Hey, what do you want to drink?",9

S03E16 The Morning After.txt,Monica,Oh no!!,16
S03E16 The Morning After.txt,Rachel,No.,16
S03E16 The Morning After.txt,Monica,"Rachel, you and Mark?!",16

S03E16 The Morning After.txt,Ross,Yeah!!,21
S03E16 The Morning After.txt,Rachel,"Eh, I’m just so sorry I put you through it. And, I y'know, I don’t want to get back together over a machine.",21

S03E16 The Morning After.txt,Phoebe,"The mailman was downstairs, so I brought up your mail.",32
S03E16 The Morning After.txt,Monica,"Oh, good. Thanks.",32
S03E16 The Morning After.txt,Phoebe,Now what is Fabutec?,32
S03E16 The Morning After.txt,Monica,"Okay, all right don’t judge me to much. Okay? Um, but I saw this info-mercial, and um, I swear to you I have never-ever bought anything on TV before, except for this mop. But there was this stuff on leg waxing, it just, it looked so amazing....",32
S03E16 The Morning After.txt,Phoebe,Waxine!!,32
S03E16 The Morning After.txt,Monica,Yes! Have you seen it?,32
S03E16 The Morning After.txt,Phoebe,"Oh, it’s incredible! I so want to be a Waxine girl.",32
S03E16 The Morning After.txt,Monica,I know!!,32
S03E16 The Morning After.txt,Phoebe,God. Do think it really doesn’t hurt? ‘Cause how can they do that?,32
S03E16 The Morning After.txt,Monica,Hello! Organic substances recently discovered in the depths of the rain forest!,32
S03E16 The Morning After.txt,Phoebe,They have the best stuff in there.,32
S03E16 The Morning After.txt,Chandler,Oh my God! Oh my God!,33
S03E16 The Morning After.txt,Joey,"Yeah. We figured when we couldn’t find you, you’d gone home to make up with Rachel. Which is probably what you shoulda done. Huh?",33
S03E16 The Morning After.txt,Ross,"You think?! God, I, ah, I’m in hell. I mean what, what am I gonna do? Rachel’s all like, ‘I love you and, and let’s work on this.’ And all I can think about is, ‘What is she gonna do? What is she gonna say?’ when I tell her what I did.",33
S03E16 The Morning After.txt,Chandler,"Well, before we answer that, I think we should address the more important question. How dumb are you?",33
S03E16 The Morning After.txt,Ross,"What?! Look, we’re trying to rebuild a relationship here, right. How am I supposed to do that here, without being totally honest with each other?",33
S03E16 The Morning After.txt,Joey,"Look, Ross look, I’m on board about this totally honesty thing, I am, just not about stuff that’s gonna get you in trouble.",33
S03E16 The Morning After.txt,Chandler,"He’s right. Nobody’s gonna benefit, and you’re just gonna hurt her.",33
S03E16 The Morning After.txt,Joey,"Yeah, and there won’t be a relationship left to rebuild.",33
S03E16 The Morning After.txt,Ross,"Yeah, but don’t you think....",33
S03E16 The Morning After.txt,Chandler,"All right look, if you absolutely have to tell her, at least wait until the timing’s right. And that’s what deathbeds are for.",33
S03E16 The Morning After.txt,Ross,What trail?,35
S03E16 The Morning After.txt,Ross,"Oh, I-I don’t think there’s any trail.",36
S03E16 The Morning After.txt,Chandler,"Okay, okay-okay, ah, Chloe works with that guy Issac. Issac’s sister is Jasmine. And Jasmine works at that message place with Phoebe. And Phoebe’s friends with Rachel. And that’s the trail, I did it!",36
S03E16 The Morning After.txt,Monica,Did that!,38
S03E16 The Morning After.txt,Phoebe,Grasp one of the linen strips by its ‘easy grab tab’ and pull it off in one quick pain free motion.,38
S03E16 The Morning After.txt,Phoebe,Was it not pain-free?,39
S03E16 The Morning After.txt,Monica,"No. It was painful. Oh my God , they should call it Pain-zine, now with a little wax.",39
S03E16 The Morning After.txt,Phoebe,"Huh, well, the girls in the satin nighties on the commercial don’t seem to think it’s that bad.",39
S03E16 The Morning After.txt,Monica,"That’s because their nerves are probably deadened from being so stupid. But hey, y'know if you don’t believe me, please, by my guest.",39
S03E16 The Morning After.txt,Monica,"Now, are you glad we didn’t start with the bikini strips?",40
S03E16 The Morning After.txt,Chloe,Is this about me taking your watch?,42
S03E16 The Morning After.txt,Ross,You took my watch?,42
S03E16 The Morning After.txt,Chloe,"I’m sorry, I do that.",42
S03E16 The Morning After.txt,Ross,"Just you keep it, listen did you, did you tell anyone about us?",42
S03E16 The Morning After.txt,Chloe,"Oh no. I feel it isn’t really anybody’s business, y'know.",42
S03E16 The Morning After.txt,Ross,"Exactly. So you didn’t, didn’t mention anything to Issac right?",42
S03E16 The Morning After.txt,Chloe,"Oh, well I tell Issac everything.",42
S03E16 The Morning After.txt,Ross,"You tell, of course you do. Issac. Issac. Hey, Issac. Issac, hi! Y'know we haven’t actually met...",42
S03E16 The Morning After.txt,Issac,You dog!,42
S03E16 The Morning After.txt,Ross,"Yes, I suppose I am a dog. But Issac, see I-I happen to have a girlfriend.",42
S03E16 The Morning After.txt,Issac,"Oh right, that Rachel chick from the coffee place.",42
S03E16 The Morning After.txt,Ross,"Yeah, that’s the one. Listen, I don’t want to hurt her.",42
S03E16 The Morning After.txt,Issac,"Oh, hey, man I know, doesn’t matter how much we love ‘em, monogamy is too cruel a rule.",42
S03E16 The Morning After.txt,Ross,"Yeah. Listen, can you keep this information to yourself?",42
S03E16 The Morning After.txt,Issac,"Aw, no problem dude. Y'know we got to look out for each other. We’re the same, you and me.",42
S03E16 The Morning After.txt,Ross,"Actually, no, we’re not.",42
S03E16 The Morning After.txt,Issac,"Yeah, we are.",42
S03E16 The Morning After.txt,Ross,"No, we’re not.",42
S03E16 The Morning After.txt,Issac,"Yeah, we are.",42
S03E16 The Morning After.txt,Ross,"No, we’re not!!",42
S03E16 The Morning After.txt,Issac,"Okay, we’re not.",42
S03E16 The Morning After.txt,Ross,Right.,42
S03E16 The Morning After.txt,Issac,"But, we are.",42
S03E16 The Morning After.txt,Ross,Fine. I just need to know that you’re not gonna tell your sister.,42
S03E16 The Morning After.txt,Issac,I can promise not to tell her again.,42
S03E16 The Morning After.txt,Jasmine,Uh-huh.,44
S03E16 The Morning After.txt,Ross,"We met at Phoebe’s birthday party, I’m, I’m Ross Geller.",44
S03E16 The Morning After.txt,Jasmine,You did a bad thing!,44
S03E16 The Morning After.txt,Ross,"Yes, I did.",44
S03E16 The Morning After.txt,Jasmine,Very bad!,44
S03E16 The Morning After.txt,Ross,Very bad.,44
S03E16 The Morning After.txt,Jasmine,"Very, very bad.",44
S03E16 The Morning After.txt,Ross,"I’m agreeing with you. Did you, listen, did you happen to tell Phoebe yet?",44
S03E16 The Morning After.txt,Jasmine,No.,44
S03E16 The Morning After.txt,Ross,"Okay, Jasmine, please, please don’t. I love my girlfriend very much, and I want more than anything to just work it out with her. Okay?",44
S03E16 The Morning After.txt,Jasmine,All right.,44
S03E16 The Morning After.txt,Ross,"Thank you, thank you.",44
S03E16 The Morning After.txt,Jasmine,"But you should probably talk to my roommate, because I told him and he knows Phoebe too.",44
S03E16 The Morning After.txt,Ross,"Gunther! Gunther. Gunther, please tell me you didn’t say anything to Rachel about me and the girl from the Xerox place.",46
S03E16 The Morning After.txt,Gunther,I’m sorry. Was I not supposed to?,46
S03E16 The Morning After.txt,Monica,Ow!,48
S03E16 The Morning After.txt,Phoebe,Oh!!,48
S03E16 The Morning After.txt,Monica,Ow!! Ow!!,48
S03E16 The Morning After.txt,Phoebe,Ow!!!,48
S03E16 The Morning After.txt,Phoebe,We’re all right.,49
S03E16 The Morning After.txt,Monica,"It’s okay, it’s okay.",49
S03E16 The Morning After.txt,Phoebe,We’re all right.,49
S03E16 The Morning After.txt,Monica,We were just waxing our legs.,49
S03E16 The Morning After.txt,Chandler,Off?!!,49
S03E16 The Morning After.txt,Phoebe,"For your information, this happens to be a pain like no man will ever experience.",49

S03E16 The Morning After.txt,Chandler,Are you actually saying these words?,102
S03E16 The Morning After.txt,Monica,Hey. It’s three in the morning. They don’t know that I’ve come home yet. You notice how neither one of them are wondering where I am.,106

S03E16 The Morning After.txt,Ross,"Y'know what, y'know what, I’m-I’m not the one that wanted that, that break, okay. You’re the one that bailed on us. You’re the one that, that ran when things got just a little rough!",107

S04E23 Rosss Wedding.txt,Phoebe,"Yeah, I do. What’s the matter?",43
S04E23 Rosss Wedding.txt,Rachel,I’m just bummed about the way I left things with Ross. I shouldn’t have lied to him about having to work. He seemed so mad at me.,43
S04E23 Rosss Wedding.txt,Phoebe,"Eh, don’t be so hard on yourself. If someone I was still in love with was getting married…",43
S04E23 Rosss Wedding.txt,Phoebe,Yeah!,44
S04E23 Rosss Wedding.txt,Rachel,I’m not in love with Ross!,44
S04E23 Rosss Wedding.txt,Phoebe,"Oh. No. No. Good! Yeah, me neither.",44
S04E23 Rosss Wedding.txt,Rachel,"Phoebe, I’m going to Ross’s wedding because he is my ex-boyfriend and that would be really uncomfortable. Not because, I’m still in love with him! I mean, hey, y’know, I like Ross as much as the next guy, y’know? Clearly I have feelings for him, but feelings don’t mean love! I mean, I still have loving feelings for Ross. Yeah! But, I have, I have continuing feelings of love, but that doesn’t mean that-that I’m still in love with him. Y’know? I-I have sexual feelings for him, but I do love him—Ohh! Oh my God! Oh my—why didn’t you tell me?!!",44
S04E23 Rosss Wedding.txt,Phoebe,We thought you knew!,44

S04E23 Rosss Wedding.txt,Rachel,"Oh, I can not believe you didn’t tell me!",44
S04E23 Rosss Wedding.txt,Phoebe,"Well, because we thought you knew!! It’s so obvious! God, that would be like telling Monica, ""Hey, you like things clean.""",44
S04E23 Rosss Wedding.txt,Joey,Hey!,45
S04E23 Rosss Wedding.txt,Chandler,"Well, I don’t have to buy that, ""I’m with stupid"" T-shirt anymore.",46
S04E23 Rosss Wedding.txt,Chandler,"All right, look, you’re not really gonna buy that are you? Don’t you think you’ve embarrassed me enough for one day?",47
S04E23 Rosss Wedding.txt,Joey,"Oh, I embarrass you?",47
S04E23 Rosss Wedding.txt,Chandler,How can I answer that when I’m pretending I don’t know you?,47
S04E23 Rosss Wedding.txt,Chandler,Oh really? Then how come no one here is wearing them?,47
S04E23 Rosss Wedding.txt,Chandler,"All right, look, if you insist on wearing that, in public, y’know, you’re gonna spend the rest of the afternoon all by yourself.",48
S04E23 Rosss Wedding.txt,Joey,Thanks.,49
S04E23 Rosss Wedding.txt,Emily,Hello?,51
S04E23 Rosss Wedding.txt,Ross,"Hey! I just spoke to your dad, and you know what? He seems to think we’ll be able to find a new place for the wedding.",51
S04E23 Rosss Wedding.txt,Emily,We don’t have to.,51
S04E23 Rosss Wedding.txt,Ross,Whoa-whoa-what? You found a place?,51
S04E23 Rosss Wedding.txt,Emily,"No. But, Monica and I were talking, and-and I was so upset about the hall being knocked down, and she suggested that we put the wedding off for a bit.",51
S04E23 Rosss Wedding.txt,Ross,She said what?,51
S04E23 Rosss Wedding.txt,Emily,"She said, ""If I’m not gonna be happy getting married somewhere that we find in a day, well then we should just postpone it.""",51
S04E23 Rosss Wedding.txt,Emily,"I realize that people are going to be disappointed. But, I’m sure they’ll come back when we can do it right.",52
S04E23 Rosss Wedding.txt,Ross,The only thing I understand is; postponing it is not an option. This is when we’re getting married.,54
S04E23 Rosss Wedding.txt,Emily,So what are you saying? It’s now or never?,54
S04E23 Rosss Wedding.txt,Emily,Or?,55
S04E23 Rosss Wedding.txt,Ross,There’s no ‘or’ in mind. What is wrong with these pants?!!,55
S04E23 Rosss Wedding.txt,Phoebe,Hey!,58
S04E23 Rosss Wedding.txt,Phoebe,"So, did shopping make you feel any better about Ross?",59
S04E23 Rosss Wedding.txt,Rachel,Manhattan does not have enough stores.,59
S04E23 Rosss Wedding.txt,Phoebe,"Well, I think I can help you get over him.",59
S04E23 Rosss Wedding.txt,Rachel,You can?,59
S04E23 Rosss Wedding.txt,Phoebe,Yeah. I just need you to bring me some photos of Ross.,59
S04E23 Rosss Wedding.txt,Rachel,Um-hmm.,59
S04E23 Rosss Wedding.txt,Phoebe,And a small piece of chocolate.,59
S04E23 Rosss Wedding.txt,Rachel,Okay.,59
S04E23 Rosss Wedding.txt,Rachel,"Ooh, is this one of those things where you throw it in a bag with some graveyard dirt and hang it from a north-facing tree?",60
S04E23 Rosss Wedding.txt,Phoebe,"Uh, only if you have the hiccups too. Yeah, the pictures are for you, the water and the chocolate is for me. I just didn’t feel like getting up. Okay, I’m gonna show you a picture of Ross. Okay? And you’re going to remember all of the bad things about him. All right? Really focus on his flaws.",60
S04E23 Rosss Wedding.txt,Rachel,I can do that. I certainly did it when we were going out.,60
S04E23 Rosss Wedding.txt,Rachel,"I don’t know, his uh, his hair never really bothered me that much, and y’know it was always more crunchy than it was greasy.",61
S04E23 Rosss Wedding.txt,Phoebe,"Okay, this is going to be harder than I thought. Umm, let’s try some uh, aversion therapy.",61
S04E23 Rosss Wedding.txt,Rachel,Okay.,61
S04E23 Rosss Wedding.txt,Phoebe,Okay?,61
S04E23 Rosss Wedding.txt,Rachel,All right.,61
S04E23 Rosss Wedding.txt,Phoebe,"So uh, now look at the picture…",61
S04E23 Rosss Wedding.txt,Rachel,Okay.,61
S04E23 Rosss Wedding.txt,Rachel,Ow!,62
S04E23 Rosss Wedding.txt,Phoebe,"Okay, how do you feel now?",62
S04E23 Rosss Wedding.txt,Rachel,"Well, I like you less!",62
S04E23 Rosss Wedding.txt,Joey,Hey.,63
S04E23 Rosss Wedding.txt,Chandler,"No-no-no, y’know what? I really shouldn’t have said that you were embarrassing me, I mean that really wasn’t cool. And if it makes you feel any better, I’ve had a really lousy day.",65
S04E23 Rosss Wedding.txt,Joey,Me too.,65
S04E23 Rosss Wedding.txt,Chandler,Yeah?,65
S04E23 Rosss Wedding.txt,Joey,"Noo!! I’ve had the best day ever! Dude, check this out!",65
S04E23 Rosss Wedding.txt,Chandler,That’s… That’s was…,72

S04E23 Rosss Wedding.txt,Joey,That’s Fergie baby!!,72
S04E23 Rosss Wedding.txt,Fergie,"Joey says you don’t really like his hat, but I think it’s kinda dashing.",72
S04E23 Rosss Wedding.txt,Chandler,How did you? How? How?,72
S04E23 Rosss Wedding.txt,Monica,Hey!,73
S04E23 Rosss Wedding.txt,Ross,Hi. I understand you had a little talk with Emily.,73
S04E23 Rosss Wedding.txt,Ross,Am I?! And was it your idea to postpone the wedding?!,74
S04E23 Rosss Wedding.txt,Monica,Umm…,74
S04E23 Rosss Wedding.txt,Chandler,I’m gonna go to the bathroom.,74
S04E23 Rosss Wedding.txt,Ross,"Hey-hey, since you’re the ‘fix-it’ lady, here’s a pickle, what do you do when the bride says she doesn’t want to have the wedding at all?",75
S04E23 Rosss Wedding.txt,Monica,She said that?!,75
S04E23 Rosss Wedding.txt,Ross,Yeah.,75
S04E23 Rosss Wedding.txt,Monica,Why?!,75
S04E23 Rosss Wedding.txt,Ross,"I don’t know, I told her it was stupid to put off the wedding just because the hall was gone and she liked flipped out.",75
S04E23 Rosss Wedding.txt,Monica,Oh my God. You’re even dumber than I am!,75
S04E23 Rosss Wedding.txt,Ross,Excuse me?,75
S04E23 Rosss Wedding.txt,Monica,"Ross, how long have you been planning this wedding?",75
S04E23 Rosss Wedding.txt,Ross,I don’t know. A month?,75
S04E23 Rosss Wedding.txt,Ross,"I had no idea. And that-that pillowcase thing, I thought you guys were just doing the flying nun.",76
S04E23 Rosss Wedding.txt,Monica,Sometimes we were.,76
S04E23 Rosss Wedding.txt,Ross,Come on. You gotta help me figure out what to do. Okay?,76

S04E23 Rosss Wedding.txt,Phoebe,"Hey, Joey! Hey! Ooh! Ooh! I just say someone on the—that looks just like you on the subway. And I was gonna go over and say ‘hi!’ but then I figured, he doesn’t care if he looks like you.",81
S04E23 Rosss Wedding.txt,Joey,"That just cost me four bucks. But uh listen, I just called to see how the chick and the duck are doing?",81
S04E23 Rosss Wedding.txt,Phoebe,"Ohh, they’re having a great time with their Aunt Phoebe! Aunt Rachel hasn’t been helpful at all. So, do you miss me?",81
S04E23 Rosss Wedding.txt,Joey,"Kinda, but I’ve just been having way too much fun.",81
S04E23 Rosss Wedding.txt,Phoebe,So you’re not homesick yet?,81
S04E23 Rosss Wedding.txt,Joey,"No, I don’t think so.",81
S04E23 Rosss Wedding.txt,Phoebe,"All right, the seven of us miss you.",81

S09E03 The Pediatrician.txt,Monica,"Well, if you really think about it, I mean four days is not that long. I mean, I see you Monday before you go to work, and I see you Thursday when you get back, and I always work late on Tuesdays, so really if you think about it, it's really just one day. And well, if we can't make it one day, we've got real problems my friend.",62

S09E03 The Pediatrician.txt,Rachel,"Ross, seriously! You've gotta go to an appropriate doctor.",65
S09E03 The Pediatrician.txt,Ross,"Why? Why? I know it's a little weird, but hey, he's a great doctor, okay? He knows my medical history, and every time I go in there, he makes a big deal. 'Ah look, it's my favorite patient!'",65
S09E03 The Pediatrician.txt,Chandler,Does he say that before he sticks his thermometer in your touchy?,65
S09E03 The Pediatrician.txt,Ross,"Hey, I seem to remember someone bringing his security blanket to college!",65

S09E03 The Pediatrician.txt,Phoebe,Why did you go along with that?,66

S09E03 The Pediatrician.txt,Mike,"My name in Mike, and I do play piano.",67
S09E03 The Pediatrician.txt,Phoebe,Prove it.,67

S09E03 The Pediatrician.txt,Sally,"It's hard isn't it? There's almost no time for a social life. I mean, where are you gonna meet someone?",73
S09E03 The Pediatrician.txt,Ross,"Well, let's say, I don't know, you met someone in the pediatrician's office.",73
S09E03 The Pediatrician.txt,Girl,"Mommy, what's wrong with that man?",76

S09E17 The Memorial Service.txt,Rachel,"All right... Oh, Emma loves him!",14
S09E17 The Memorial Service.txt,Joey,Why wouldn't she? He's a wonderful person!,14

S09E17 The Memorial Service.txt,Chandler,You're not gonna need my help?,16
S09E17 The Memorial Service.txt,Phoebe,"Well no, when I get to the point where... you know... I'm ready to hear cruel mocking jokes about Mike... I'm gonna come to you.",16
S09E17 The Memorial Service.txt,Phoebe,"Ok. I mean I know I did the right thing. You know, Mike never wants to get married and I shouldn't be in a relationship that has no future... but... pretty soon I'm gonna miss him so much. I'm gonna wanna see him again and you have to stop me from doing that.",17
S09E17 The Memorial Service.txt,Monica,"Ok, you got it!",17
S09E17 The Memorial Service.txt,Monica,Really? If that's what you want...,18
S09E17 The Memorial Service.txt,Phoebe,That was a test and you just failed.,18

S09E17 The Memorial Service.txt,Chandler,I believe I read that somewhere!,20
S09E17 The Memorial Service.txt,Chandler,I respectfully disagree.,21
S09E17 The Memorial Service.txt,Ross,I can't believe you put that on my alumni page!,21
S09E17 The Memorial Service.txt,Chandler,Who cares? Nobody reads those things,21
S09E17 The Memorial Service.txt,Ross,You'd better hope not because I just read what you put on your page today.,21
S09E17 The Memorial Service.txt,Chandler,I don't have a page.,21
S09E17 The Memorial Service.txt,Ross,Oh oh oh! I RESPECTFULLY DISAGREE!!,21
S09E17 The Memorial Service.txt,Joey,"It's okay, it's okay Rach, it's me. Put down the scrunchy.",24
S09E17 The Memorial Service.txt,Rachel,What are you doing?,24
S09E17 The Memorial Service.txt,Joey,"Well, I heard Emma stirring, so I came to make sure she could reach Hugsy.",24
S09E17 The Memorial Service.txt,Rachel,"Oh, oh thanks. Alright well, now that I'm up I'm going to go to the bathroom.",24
S09E17 The Memorial Service.txt,Chandler,Because I told everyone he slept with dinosaurs.,27
S09E17 The Memorial Service.txt,Chandler,Would you get that please? People have been calling to congratulate me all day.,28
S09E17 The Memorial Service.txt,Monica,What are you doing?,30
S09E17 The Memorial Service.txt,Chandler,"Oh, you'll see my friend.",30
S09E17 The Memorial Service.txt,Ross,Posting that I died? That really isn't funny.,33
S09E17 The Memorial Service.txt,Chandler,"Well, how you died was funny.",33
S09E17 The Memorial Service.txt,Ross,"Oh please, hit by a blimp?",33
S09E17 The Memorial Service.txt,Chandler,It kills over one americans every year.,33
S09E17 The Memorial Service.txt,Ross,"Unbelievable, my classmates are gonna think I'm dead, my professors, my... my parents are gonna get phone calls. You're messing with people's feelings here.",33
S09E17 The Memorial Service.txt,Chandler,You wanna talk about people's feelings? You should have heard how hurt professor Stern was yesterday when I told him I wouldn't be able to go with him to Key West!,33
S09E17 The Memorial Service.txt,Ross,"You've really crossed the line here, but that's okay, it's ok 'cause I'm on my way to buy some Photoshop software and a stack of gay porn. That's right! Your coming out is about to get real graphic.",33
S09E17 The Memorial Service.txt,Phoebe,"God, I wish Mike were here.",34
S09E17 The Memorial Service.txt,Monica,Okay if Mike were here what would the two of you be doing?,34
S09E17 The Memorial Service.txt,Monica,"What are you, animals? It's 4 o'clock in the afternoon!",35
S09E17 The Memorial Service.txt,Phoebe,"I gotta call him. Just to talk to him, there's no harm in that.",35
S09E17 The Memorial Service.txt,Phoebe,Here.,36
S09E17 The Memorial Service.txt,Monica,And now your cell.,36
S09E17 The Memorial Service.txt,Monica,This is your cellphone?,37

S09E17 The Memorial Service.txt,Monica,"No, no! Give it to me!",38
S09E17 The Memorial Service.txt,Phoebe,You can't have it.,38
S09E17 The Memorial Service.txt,Monica,Give it to me!,38
S09E17 The Memorial Service.txt,Monica,I'll go in there.,39

S09E17 The Memorial Service.txt,Joey,"Hey, look who's here! It's Joey, and he brought home a friend.",42
S09E17 The Memorial Service.txt,Rachel,"Joey, Emma's right here! You promised not to bring girls home in the middle of the day anymore.",42
S09E17 The Memorial Service.txt,Joey,"No, no, it's not a girl, it's... a brand new Hugsy!",42
S09E17 The Memorial Service.txt,Rachel,"Oh that's so great, now Emma has two Hugsy's.",42
S09E17 The Memorial Service.txt,Joey,"No, no, Emma has one Hugsy, the new Hugsy, huh? The other Hugsy, I don't know, I guess I'll just take it back.",42
S09E17 The Memorial Service.txt,Rachel,"Oh you know what? When I was a little girl I had a little pink pony named Cotton. Oh I loved her so much, I took her everywhere, I would braid her tail...",42
S09E17 The Memorial Service.txt,Rachel,Should I be concerned that a button fell off the old Hugsy and I can't find it?,43
S09E17 The Memorial Service.txt,Joey,"Oh, no don't worry about that, I swallowed that years ago.",43
S09E17 The Memorial Service.txt,Rachel,"Oh, I don't think she likes the new Hugsy.",44
S09E17 The Memorial Service.txt,Joey,But he's the same.,44
S09E17 The Memorial Service.txt,Rachel,"Yeah, I think she wants the old one back.",44
S09E17 The Memorial Service.txt,Joey,But he's the same.,44
S09E17 The Memorial Service.txt,Rachel,"Joey, come on!",44
S09E17 The Memorial Service.txt,Joey,He's the same!,44
S09E17 The Memorial Service.txt,Monica,Haha!,47
S09E17 The Memorial Service.txt,Phoebe,"You know, it's a lot less surprising to do that after I've buzzed you into the building.",47
S09E17 The Memorial Service.txt,Monica,"So Phoebe, why are there men's shoes by the door.",47
S09E17 The Memorial Service.txt,Phoebe,Those are my shoes.,47
S09E17 The Memorial Service.txt,Monica,"Oh, when you get over this breakup we need to go shopping.",47
S09E17 The Memorial Service.txt,Phoebe,"Monica, I really appreciate you checking in on me, but I'm actually feeling a lot better. Yeah, I just kinda want to be alone right now.",47
S09E17 The Memorial Service.txt,Phoebe,I ordered Chinese food.,49
S09E17 The Memorial Service.txt,Phoebe,What are the chances? 1 billion Chinese people and they send Mike!?,50
S09E17 The Memorial Service.txt,Mike,Phoebe called me.,51
S09E17 The Memorial Service.txt,Monica,Phoebe!,51
S09E17 The Memorial Service.txt,Phoebe,"I'm sorry, I broke down... I wanted to see him.",51
S09E17 The Memorial Service.txt,Monica,Damnit Phoebe! How did you even call him?,51
S09E17 The Memorial Service.txt,Phoebe,There is a speakerphone on the base unit...,51
S09E17 The Memorial Service.txt,Monica,Base Unit! Think Monica! Think!,51
S09E17 The Memorial Service.txt,Mike,"Look, if I wanna see Phoebe and she wants to see...",51
S09E17 The Memorial Service.txt,Mike,"Oh! Sorry, I guess I was thrown off by the mention of my name!",52
S09E17 The Memorial Service.txt,Monica,"Look, guys, you can't do this, it's just going to make getting over each other, that much harder.",52
S09E17 The Memorial Service.txt,Phoebe,Not if nothing happens. Why can't... why can't we just hang out as friends?,52
S09E17 The Memorial Service.txt,Phoebe,Sit down.,53
S09E17 The Memorial Service.txt,Monica,I've been pretty good!,56
S09E17 The Memorial Service.txt,Phoebe,"Thanks, you look good too.",57
S09E17 The Memorial Service.txt,Monica,Oh no no no no... this is dangerous territory. Keep it clean!,57
S09E17 The Memorial Service.txt,Phoebe,So how's the piano playing going?,57
S09E17 The Memorial Service.txt,Mike,Actually I've been playing a lot of love songs lately. I've missed you.,57
S09E17 The Memorial Service.txt,Phoebe,I've missed you too.,57
S09E17 The Memorial Service.txt,Monica,"You know, on the way over here, I saw this drunk guy throw up. And then a pigeon ate it!",58
S09E17 The Memorial Service.txt,Chandler,Huh! So that's what I would look like if I worked out... and was being serviced by a policeman. You're not actually going to send these out are ya?,61
S09E17 The Memorial Service.txt,Chandler,"No, come on, you know that's not true.",62
S09E17 The Memorial Service.txt,Ross,What are you talking about? You get sixty responses just for coming out of the closet! I didn't get one response! And I'm dead!,62
S09E17 The Memorial Service.txt,Chandler,"Well, the gay community is a lot more vocal than the dead community.",62
S09E17 The Memorial Service.txt,Chandler,"Alright look, let's think about this, ok, do you really think that people are gonna stir up your family at this tragic time? That people are gonna post condolences on a website? This is not about people not caring that you're dead .This is about people not having a decent outlet for their grief.",63
S09E17 The Memorial Service.txt,Ross,You're right. There isn't a decent outlet.,63
S09E17 The Memorial Service.txt,Chandler,"Right, I mean, come on, I'm sure that if you had a funeral or a memorial service, tons of people would come.",63
S09E17 The Memorial Service.txt,Ross,No! That would be stupid! You're having it for me!,65
S09E17 The Memorial Service.txt,Chandler,"Ross, don't press send, don't press se... !",65
S09E17 The Memorial Service.txt,Ross,"oh, too late, too late! It's sent... oops sorry and so is the picture of you and the police man...",65
S09E17 The Memorial Service.txt,Rachel,"I'm trying to put Emma down for a nap, have you seen Hugsy?",66
S09E17 The Memorial Service.txt,Joey,Original or crappy?,66
S09E17 The Memorial Service.txt,Rachel,Original.,66
S09E17 The Memorial Service.txt,Joey,"No, sorry haven't seen him.",66
S09E17 The Memorial Service.txt,Rachel,Then what's that big lump under your covers?,66
S09E17 The Memorial Service.txt,Joey,"It's Monica, ok?",66
S09E17 The Memorial Service.txt,Rachel,That's not Monica!,66
S09E17 The Memorial Service.txt,Joey,"Alright!! Fine! It's original Hugsy! No, now I know that Emma wants him but he's mine and I need him..",66
S09E17 The Memorial Service.txt,Joey,... she's being unreasonable!,67
S09E17 The Memorial Service.txt,Joey,It does?,68
S09E17 The Memorial Service.txt,Rachel,Yeah! And she's comforted by him because she loves her uncle Joey so much.,68
S09E17 The Memorial Service.txt,Joey,Really? She... she loves me?,68
S09E17 The Memorial Service.txt,Joey,"Ok, wait wait wait wait a minute wait a minute, I mean Rach, I mean if if... . If Hugsy means that much to Emma then... well she can have him.",69
S09E17 The Memorial Service.txt,Joey,Look forget it forget it... I can't do it.,70
S09E17 The Memorial Service.txt,Rachel,Are you gonna... you're going to take Hugsy away from a little child?,70
S09E17 The Memorial Service.txt,Joey,How do you think I got him in the first place?,70
S09E17 The Memorial Service.txt,Monica,"Alright you two, I'm gonna go to the bathroom. Now I don't want anything going on while I'm gone. Here's a few things you can discuss: mucus, fungus and the idea of me and Ross doing it.",72
S09E17 The Memorial Service.txt,Mike,"I've missed you so much! No, I'm not gonna ask you to get back together because I know we want different things, but just to be with you one more night.",72
S09E17 The Memorial Service.txt,Phoebe,"I know, I want that too, but IS that going to make it too hard?",72
S09E17 The Memorial Service.txt,Mike,"It can't be any harder than this... I mean, If I had known the last time I saw you would be the last time, I... I would have stopped to memorize your face, the way you move, everything about you. If I had known the last time I kissed you would have been the last time... I never would have stopped.",72
S09E17 The Memorial Service.txt,Phoebe,What?,73
S09E17 The Memorial Service.txt,Monica,Didn't you hear that speech? If you don't kiss him then I will!,73
S09E17 The Memorial Service.txt,Mike,"Oh, crap!",75
S09E17 The Memorial Service.txt,Phoebe,Who is this?,75
S09E17 The Memorial Service.txt,Mike,My friend Manny. I asked him to keep me away from you.,75
S09E17 The Memorial Service.txt,Monica,"Hi, that's what I'm doing for Phoebe!",75
S09E17 The Memorial Service.txt,Manny,"Well, you are not doing a very good job!",75
S09E17 The Memorial Service.txt,Monica,Excuse me?,75
S09E17 The Memorial Service.txt,Manny,What's with the kissing?,75
S09E17 The Memorial Service.txt,Monica,"Hey, at least I knew where my guy was.",75
S09E17 The Memorial Service.txt,Manny,"Oh yeah yeah, thank God you were here to oversee all the kissing!",75
S09E17 The Memorial Service.txt,Monica,You didn't hear the speech!,75
S09E17 The Memorial Service.txt,Monica,"Hey, it was very moving! You're just heartless!",76
S09E17 The Memorial Service.txt,Manny,You're weak!,76
S09E17 The Memorial Service.txt,Monica,You're... weird!,76
S09E17 The Memorial Service.txt,Manny,Your pants are undone!,76
S09E17 The Memorial Service.txt,Monica,Damn it!,78
S09E17 The Memorial Service.txt,Manny,Oh we blew it. I blame myself.,78
S09E17 The Memorial Service.txt,Monica,And I blame you too.,78
S09E17 The Memorial Service.txt,Ross,"It's been an hour and not one of my classmates has shown up! I tell you, when I actually die some people are gonna get seriously haunted!",79
S09E17 The Memorial Service.txt,Chandler,There you go! Someone came!,80
S09E17 The Memorial Service.txt,Monica,"Hi, glad you could come.",82
S09E17 The Memorial Service.txt,Tom,"Hi, you're Chandler Bing, right? I'm Tom Gordon, I was in your class.",83
S09E17 The Memorial Service.txt,Chandler,"Oh yes, yes... let me... take your coat.",83
S09E17 The Memorial Service.txt,Tom,"Thanks... uh... I'm so sorry about Ross, it's...",83
S09E17 The Memorial Service.txt,Ross,Who is he?,84
S09E17 The Memorial Service.txt,Chandler,"Some guy, Tom Gordon.",84
S09E17 The Memorial Service.txt,Monica,"So, did you know Ross well?",85
S09E17 The Memorial Service.txt,Tom,"Oh, actually I barely knew him. Yeah, I came because I heard Chandler's news. D'you know if he's seeing anyone?",85
S09E17 The Memorial Service.txt,Tom,What? You... You... Oh! Can I ask you a personal question? Ho-how do you shave your beard so close?,86
S09E17 The Memorial Service.txt,Monica,I look like a man??,90
S09E17 The Memorial Service.txt,Chandler,"Please, one ridiculous problem at a time!",90
S09E17 The Memorial Service.txt,Ross,"It isn't ridiculous, look around! No one's here!",90
S09E17 The Memorial Service.txt,Chandler,"You gave them one day's notice, not everyone in our class checks the web site everyday and Monica... it's probably the way you stand!",90
S09E17 The Memorial Service.txt,Ross,"Yes, you're right. Still somebody must have seen it... I mean, I went to that school for 4 years, I didn't have an impact on anyone?",90
S09E17 The Memorial Service.txt,Chandler,"Oh, that's not true. You had an impact on me, I mean, it's 15 years later and we're still best friends. Doesn't that count for something?",90
S09E17 The Memorial Service.txt,Kori,Hi. I'm here for Ross Geller's memorial service.,94
S09E17 The Memorial Service.txt,Chandler,Kori? Kori Weston?,94

S09E17 The Memorial Service.txt,Chandler,"Chandler, Chandler Bing. I'm not gay, I'm not gay at all.",94
S09E17 The Memorial Service.txt,Monica,You are married though.,94
S09E17 The Memorial Service.txt,Kori,I can't believe that Ross is gone. It is just so sad.,95
S09E17 The Memorial Service.txt,Chandler,I didn't know Ross and you were so close.,95
S09E17 The Memorial Service.txt,Kori,We weren't but we had one class together. He was such a great guy and he talked so passionately about science. I always remembered him.,95
S09E17 The Memorial Service.txt,Chandler,"I'm sure that would mean a lot to him. And if heaven has a door, I'm sure he's pressing his ear up against it and listening intently.",95
S09E17 The Memorial Service.txt,Kori,I thought so many times about calling him and asking him out. I guess I really missed my chance.,95
S09E17 The Memorial Service.txt,Ross,Did you hear that? Kori Weston had a crush on me!!,97
S01E24 Rachel Finds Out.txt,Ross,And here's little Ben nodding off...,2
S01E24 Rachel Finds Out.txt,Monica,"Awww, look at Aunt Monica's little boy!",2
S01E24 Rachel Finds Out.txt,Phoebe,"Oh, look, he's got Ross's haircut!",2

S01E24 Rachel Finds Out.txt,Monica,"Oh, Joey, please tell me you're only donating your time.",13
S01E24 Rachel Finds Out.txt,Joey,"Alright, come on you guys, it's not that big a deal. Really... I mean, I just go down there every other day and... make my contribution to the project. Hey, hey, but at the end of two weeks, I get seven hundred dollars.",13
S01E24 Rachel Finds Out.txt,Ross,Hey.,13
S01E24 Rachel Finds Out.txt,Phoebe,"Wow, ooh, you're gonna be making money hand over fist!",13

S01E24 Rachel Finds Out.txt,Joey,"Well, the tough thing is, she really wants to have sex with me.",18
S01E24 Rachel Finds Out.txt,Chandler,Crazy bitch.,18
S01E24 Rachel Finds Out.txt,Joey,"Yeah, well, I still got a week left to go in the program, and according to the rules, if I want to get the money I'm not allowed to conduct any... ersonal experiments, if you know what I mean.",18
S01E24 Rachel Finds Out.txt,Monica,Joey... we always know what you mean.,18
S01E24 Rachel Finds Out.txt,Phoebe,Hey.,19
S01E24 Rachel Finds Out.txt,Monica,Hey.,19
S01E24 Rachel Finds Out.txt,Phoebe,How long did you think this barbecue was gonna last?,20

S01E24 Rachel Finds Out.txt,Joey,Oh no! How can she do that when she's never shown any interest in you?!?,29
S01E24 Rachel Finds Out.txt,Chandler,Forget about her.,29

S01E24 Rachel Finds Out.txt,Rachel,"It was like months ago. We were walking by this antique store, and I saw this pin in the window, and I told him it was just like one my grandmother had when I was a little girl. Oh! I can't believe he remembered!",47
S01E24 Rachel Finds Out.txt,Phoebe,"Oh, it's so pretty. This must have cost him a fortune.",48
S01E24 Rachel Finds Out.txt,Monica,I can't believe he did this.,48

S01E24 Rachel Finds Out.txt,Joey,"Oh, it was amazing. You know how you always think you're great in bed?",79
S01E24 Rachel Finds Out.txt,Chandler,The fact that you'd even ask that question shows how little you know me.,79
S01E24 Rachel Finds Out.txt,Joey,"Well, it's like, last night, I couldn't do the thing that usually makes me great. So I had to do all this other stuff. And the response I got... man, oh man, it was like a ticker tape parade!",79

S01E24 Rachel Finds Out.txt,Joey,"It was amazing! And not just for her... uh-uh. For me, too. It's like, all of a sudden, I'm blind. But all my other senses are heightened, y'know? It's like... I was able to appreciate it on another level.",79

S01E24 Rachel Finds Out.txt,Rachel,"Uh, yeah. Uh, Monica, y'know, honey, I've been thinking about it and I've decided this—this whole Ross thing, it's just not a good idea.",80
S01E24 Rachel Finds Out.txt,Monica,"Oh, why?",80
S01E24 Rachel Finds Out.txt,Rachel,"Because, I feel like I wouldn't just be going out with him. I would be going out with all of you. Oh, and there would just be all this pressure, and I don't wanna...",80
S01E24 Rachel Finds Out.txt,Rachel,"Monica, nothing has even happened yet, and you're already so...",81

S05E07 Ross Moves In.txt,Joey,"Dude, stop talking crazy and make us some tea!",119
S07E19 Ross And Monicas Cousin.txt,Joey,"I’m sorry, do I know you?",3
S07E19 Ross And Monicas Cousin.txt,Phoebe,What are you doing?,3
S07E19 Ross And Monicas Cousin.txt,Joey,"Nothing, I’m just practicing blowing you off because I’m gonna be a big movie star!",3
S07E19 Ross And Monicas Cousin.txt,Phoebe,Oh! You got it?!,3
S07E19 Ross And Monicas Cousin.txt,Joey,"Well, no not yet. But the audition went really good.",3
S07E19 Ross And Monicas Cousin.txt,Monica,What was it for?,3
S07E19 Ross And Monicas Cousin.txt,Joey,"Oh, it’s this big budget period movie about these three Italian brothers who come to America around the turn of the century. It’s really classy! Oh, and the director is supposed to be the next, next Martin Scorcese.",3
S07E19 Ross And Monicas Cousin.txt,Phoebe,"The next, next?",3
S07E19 Ross And Monicas Cousin.txt,Estelle,Joey! It’s Estelle! I just talked to the casting people; they loved you!,4
S07E19 Ross And Monicas Cousin.txt,Estelle,"Yeah, they wanna see you again tomorrow.",5
S07E19 Ross And Monicas Cousin.txt,Estelle,There’s just one thing. Do you have a problem with full frontal nudity?,6
S07E19 Ross And Monicas Cousin.txt,Phoebe,What’s the matter?,7
S07E19 Ross And Monicas Cousin.txt,Joey,They want me to be totally naked in the movie!,7
S07E19 Ross And Monicas Cousin.txt,Monica,Wow!,7
S07E19 Ross And Monicas Cousin.txt,Joey,I know! My grandmother’s gonna see this!,7
S07E19 Ross And Monicas Cousin.txt,Phoebe,Grandma’s gonna have to get in line.,7
S07E19 Ross And Monicas Cousin.txt,Phoebe,Hey the wedding is so close! Are you getting nervous?,8
S07E19 Ross And Monicas Cousin.txt,Monica,Yeah. But a part of me also can’t wait ‘til it’s over. Chandler and I have this pact not to have sex again until the wedding.,8
S07E19 Ross And Monicas Cousin.txt,Ross,A no sex pact huh? I actually have one of those going on with every woman in America.,8
S07E19 Ross And Monicas Cousin.txt,Monica,"Hey Phoebe, will you give me a hand?",8
S07E19 Ross And Monicas Cousin.txt,Phoebe,Sure.,8
S07E19 Ross And Monicas Cousin.txt,Ross,Cassie?,9
S07E19 Ross And Monicas Cousin.txt,Monica,Uh-hmm.,9
S07E19 Ross And Monicas Cousin.txt,Ross,"Wow, I haven’t seen her for like forever. I wonder if she still carries that Barbie everywhere she goes.",9
S07E19 Ross And Monicas Cousin.txt,Monica,"Ross, she’s 25 years old.",9
S07E19 Ross And Monicas Cousin.txt,Ross,So what! I still have—No you’re probably right.,9
S07E19 Ross And Monicas Cousin.txt,Monica,Hey!,10
S07E19 Ross And Monicas Cousin.txt,Phoebe,Hey!,10
S07E19 Ross And Monicas Cousin.txt,Rachel,"Hey Pheebs, can I talk to you over here for a second?",10
S07E19 Ross And Monicas Cousin.txt,Phoebe,Yeah!,10
S07E19 Ross And Monicas Cousin.txt,Monica,Subtle guys!,10
S07E19 Ross And Monicas Cousin.txt,Phoebe,What?!,10
S07E19 Ross And Monicas Cousin.txt,Monica,I know you’re planning my surprise bridal shower.,10
S07E19 Ross And Monicas Cousin.txt,Monica,Hey! What did you decide to do about the movie?,14
S07E19 Ross And Monicas Cousin.txt,Joey,"I don’t know! It’s not like it’s porn! This is a serious, legitimate movie. Y’know? And the nudity is really important to the story.",14
S07E19 Ross And Monicas Cousin.txt,Monica,That’s what you say about porn.,14
S07E19 Ross And Monicas Cousin.txt,Joey,You’re right. Maybe I shouldn’t even go on the call back.,14
S07E19 Ross And Monicas Cousin.txt,Monica,No! No you should! A lot of major actors do nude scenes! I mean the chance to star in a movie? Come on!,14
S07E19 Ross And Monicas Cousin.txt,Joey,Well that’s true. And I am only naked in one scene. Plus it sounds really great. My character’s catholic and he falls in love with this Jewish girl. Who run away together and they get caught in this big rainstorm. So we go into this barn and undress each other and hold each other. It’s really sweet and-and tender.,14
S07E19 Ross And Monicas Cousin.txt,Phoebe,Well when can we have this shower?,16
S07E19 Ross And Monicas Cousin.txt,Rachel,She has got so much going on we-we have only two options. We have Friday…,16
S07E19 Ross And Monicas Cousin.txt,Phoebe,Well that’s only two days away. What is the other option?,16
S07E19 Ross And Monicas Cousin.txt,Rachel,Yesterday!,16
S07E19 Ross And Monicas Cousin.txt,Phoebe,"Well if we make it yesterday, woo-hoo! We’re done!",16
S07E19 Ross And Monicas Cousin.txt,Rachel,"Oh my God Phoebe, this is impossible! We can’t do this by Friday! We have to find a place. We have to invite people! We have to get food! There’s just too much to do! It’s impossible! We can’t do it! We cannot do it! We cannot do it!",16
S07E19 Ross And Monicas Cousin.txt,Phoebe,"Rachel, calm down!",16
S07E19 Ross And Monicas Cousin.txt,Rachel,"Phoebe, I already, I already did.",18
S07E19 Ross And Monicas Cousin.txt,Phoebe,"Oh okay. All right, then I need to calm down a little.",18
S07E19 Ross And Monicas Cousin.txt,Phoebe,"Uh, here. What time?",19
S07E19 Ross And Monicas Cousin.txt,Rachel,4 o’clock. Food?,19
S07E19 Ross And Monicas Cousin.txt,Phoebe,Finger sandwiches and tea.,19
S07E19 Ross And Monicas Cousin.txt,Rachel,Ooh great! Very Monica.,19
S07E19 Ross And Monicas Cousin.txt,Phoebe,And chili!,19
S07E19 Ross And Monicas Cousin.txt,Rachel,"Ah you went one too far. Uh, flowers or balloons?",19
S07E19 Ross And Monicas Cousin.txt,Phoebe,Both!,19
S07E19 Ross And Monicas Cousin.txt,Rachel,We’re paying for this y’know.,19
S07E19 Ross And Monicas Cousin.txt,Phoebe,Neither.,19
S07E19 Ross And Monicas Cousin.txt,Rachel,"Okay. Umm, what should we do for the theme?",19
S07E19 Ross And Monicas Cousin.txt,Phoebe,Lusts of the flesh.,19
S07E19 Ross And Monicas Cousin.txt,Chandler,Hey!,22
S07E19 Ross And Monicas Cousin.txt,Monica,Hey!,22
S07E19 Ross And Monicas Cousin.txt,Chandler,Y’know I’m-I’m really glad we decided not to sleep together before the wedding.,22
S07E19 Ross And Monicas Cousin.txt,Monica,Oh boy me too!,22
S07E19 Ross And Monicas Cousin.txt,Chandler,Y’know I was thinking if we had a…a big fight and uh we broke up for a few hours…,22
S07E19 Ross And Monicas Cousin.txt,Monica,Yeah?,22
S07E19 Ross And Monicas Cousin.txt,Chandler,"Technically we could have sex again. What do you think, bossy and domineering?!",22
S07E19 Ross And Monicas Cousin.txt,Monica,"The wedding is off, sloppy and immature!",22
S07E19 Ross And Monicas Cousin.txt,Chandler,That’s me! Come on!,22
S07E19 Ross And Monicas Cousin.txt,Chandler,"Well get rid of her, obsessive and shrill.",23
S07E19 Ross And Monicas Cousin.txt,Monica,Shrill?! The wedding is back on!,23
S07E19 Ross And Monicas Cousin.txt,Cassie,I thought I heard voices. You must be Chandler.,24
S07E19 Ross And Monicas Cousin.txt,Cassie,Nice to meet you too.,25
S07E19 Ross And Monicas Cousin.txt,Monica,"So, are you ready to go?",25
S07E19 Ross And Monicas Cousin.txt,Cassie,Yeah.,25
S07E19 Ross And Monicas Cousin.txt,Chandler,I’ll be right with you.,27
S07E19 Ross And Monicas Cousin.txt,Ross,What—why?,29
S07E19 Ross And Monicas Cousin.txt,Monica,Because Purvry Perverson over here can’t stop staring at her.,29
S07E19 Ross And Monicas Cousin.txt,Ross,What?! Chandler she’s our cousin!,29
S07E19 Ross And Monicas Cousin.txt,Monica,You were staring about eight inches south of there.,30
S07E19 Ross And Monicas Cousin.txt,Ross,"Fine, she can stay at my place. By the way, what-what does Cassie even look like now.",30
S07E19 Ross And Monicas Cousin.txt,Monica,She looks exactly like Aunt Marilyn.,30
S07E19 Ross And Monicas Cousin.txt,Chandler,"Umm, so this Aunt Marilyn is-is-is-is she coming to the wedding?",30
S07E19 Ross And Monicas Cousin.txt,Monica,Wafer thin ice!,30
S07E19 Ross And Monicas Cousin.txt,Joey,"Hey, I’m back!",31
S07E19 Ross And Monicas Cousin.txt,Joey,"Uh so, will-will I be reading the same scene again?",31
S07E19 Ross And Monicas Cousin.txt,Joey,And scene! Huh? Wasn’t that fun? We did a little improv there. Yeah! Okay! So you-you-you-you were saying?,32
S07E19 Ross And Monicas Cousin.txt,Joey,Wow! Sure! That’s great!,32
S07E19 Ross And Monicas Cousin.txt,Joey,"Yeah! Yeah sure, just long as it’s handled tastefully and that barn is not too cold.",32
S07E19 Ross And Monicas Cousin.txt,Joey,So…What?,33
S07E19 Ross And Monicas Cousin.txt,Joey,Yes!,33
S07E19 Ross And Monicas Cousin.txt,Joey,No. What?,33
S07E19 Ross And Monicas Cousin.txt,Joey,Barmifsaed?,33
S07E19 Ross And Monicas Cousin.txt,Monica,So to get this part you can’t be?,35
S07E19 Ross And Monicas Cousin.txt,Joey,Nope.,35
S07E19 Ross And Monicas Cousin.txt,Monica,But you are?,35
S07E19 Ross And Monicas Cousin.txt,Joey,Yep.,35
S07E19 Ross And Monicas Cousin.txt,Monica,But you told them you weren’t?,35
S07E19 Ross And Monicas Cousin.txt,Joey,That’s right.,35
S07E19 Ross And Monicas Cousin.txt,Joey,"I don’t know! I really want this part! And they tell you no matter what you get asked at an audition you say yes. Like if-if they want you to ride a horse, you tell ‘em you can! And just figure out how to do it later.",36
S07E19 Ross And Monicas Cousin.txt,Monica,Joey! This is not like learning to ride a horse! This is like learning to…grow a turtleneck!,36
S07E19 Ross And Monicas Cousin.txt,Joey,I kn-I know! I know! Okay? And apparently tomorrow when I go in to meet the director I have to take off my clothes so that they can see what my body looks like.,36
S07E19 Ross And Monicas Cousin.txt,Monica,"Oh my God, what are you gonna do?!",36
S07E19 Ross And Monicas Cousin.txt,Monica,Unless!,37
S07E19 Ross And Monicas Cousin.txt,Joey,Unless what?,37
S07E19 Ross And Monicas Cousin.txt,Monica,"Well, this may sound crazy, but there maybe something we could fashion.",37
S07E19 Ross And Monicas Cousin.txt,Joey,Like what?,37
S07E19 Ross And Monicas Cousin.txt,Monica,"Well I’m not sure yet, but umm of the top of my head I’m thinking double sided tape and some sort of luncheon meat.",37
S07E19 Ross And Monicas Cousin.txt,Phoebe,"Hey! I’ve got a great idea for party favors for the shower. Okay, we get some uh mahogany boxes and carve everyone’s names in them and inside is everyone’s individual birth stone.",38
S07E19 Ross And Monicas Cousin.txt,Rachel,"Okay. Okay. All right, you take care of that. And meanwhile, the party is tomorrow and we still don’t have a guest list.",38
S07E19 Ross And Monicas Cousin.txt,Phoebe,"Okay. Okay! Well okay, who do we know that’s coming? Me. Are you?",38
S07E19 Ross And Monicas Cousin.txt,Phoebe,Hey!,39
S07E19 Ross And Monicas Cousin.txt,Rachel,Hey! What’s up Mon?,39
S07E19 Ross And Monicas Cousin.txt,Monica,"Well uh, I’m trying to make something for Joey. Do you mind if I raid your fridge?",39
S07E19 Ross And Monicas Cousin.txt,Rachel,Have at it.,39
S07E19 Ross And Monicas Cousin.txt,Rachel,Are you makin’ him a sandwich?,40
S07E19 Ross And Monicas Cousin.txt,Monica,"No it’s umm, more like a wrap. Okay so uh, I’m gonna go guys.",40
S07E19 Ross And Monicas Cousin.txt,Rachel,Oh my God you’re amazing! Did you just pull that out of her purse?,43
S07E19 Ross And Monicas Cousin.txt,Cassie,Hey Ross!,46
S07E19 Ross And Monicas Cousin.txt,Ross,Hey!,46
S07E19 Ross And Monicas Cousin.txt,Ross,"Oh. Oh, that’s right. So-so you did see me that day because it seemed like you didn’t.",47
S07E19 Ross And Monicas Cousin.txt,Cassie,"Ah yeah, sorry about that.",47
S07E19 Ross And Monicas Cousin.txt,Ross,"It’s okay. Come, come on in.",47
S07E19 Ross And Monicas Cousin.txt,Cassie,"Thanks for letting me stay here! I mean Monica’s place was nice, but her fiancee sure stares a lot.",47
S07E19 Ross And Monicas Cousin.txt,Ross,Oh.,47
S07E19 Ross And Monicas Cousin.txt,Cassie,Oh my God! You do a great Chandler!,48
S07E19 Ross And Monicas Cousin.txt,Ross,Uh-huh. Yeah I-I have a knack for impressions.,48
S07E19 Ross And Monicas Cousin.txt,Cassie,"Well, maybe after we get reacquainted uh, you can do me.",48
S07E19 Ross And Monicas Cousin.txt,Ross,Yeah—No!!,48
S07E19 Ross And Monicas Cousin.txt,Ross,"Cassie, how you-how you doin’ on that…hot dog.",49
S07E19 Ross And Monicas Cousin.txt,Cassie,I’m all done.,49
S07E19 Ross And Monicas Cousin.txt,Cassie,I guess the last time we really hung out was when our parents rented that beach house together.,50
S07E19 Ross And Monicas Cousin.txt,Cassie,"It took you that long to figure it out, huh?",53
S07E19 Ross And Monicas Cousin.txt,Phoebe,Hi!,55
S07E19 Ross And Monicas Cousin.txt,Woman,Hi!,55
S07E19 Ross And Monicas Cousin.txt,Woman,Oh thank you.,56

S07E19 Ross And Monicas Cousin.txt,Phoebe,Who the hell are all these people?,59
S07E19 Ross And Monicas Cousin.txt,Rachel,"Well, I don’t know. I called all the people in Monica’s phone book and these are the only ones who could show up on 24 hours notice.",59
S07E19 Ross And Monicas Cousin.txt,Phoebe,"Hmm, y’know there’s another word for people like that. Losers!",59
S07E19 Ross And Monicas Cousin.txt,Woman,I was her accountant four years ago.,61
S07E19 Ross And Monicas Cousin.txt,Rachel,Ohhhh!,61
S07E19 Ross And Monicas Cousin.txt,Woman,I’m very interested to find out who’s been doing her taxes these last four years.,61
S07E19 Ross And Monicas Cousin.txt,Rachel,That’s great!,61
S07E19 Ross And Monicas Cousin.txt,Woman,"So, what time is Monica supposed to get here?",61
S07E19 Ross And Monicas Cousin.txt,Phoebe,You were supposed to tell her!,63
S07E19 Ross And Monicas Cousin.txt,Rachel,No I wasn’t! You were supposed to tell her to come and I was supposed to bring the cake!,63
S07E19 Ross And Monicas Cousin.txt,Phoebe,"Fine, I’ll go call her.",63
S07E19 Ross And Monicas Cousin.txt,Rachel,Yes! And please tell her to bring a cake!,63

S07E19 Ross And Monicas Cousin.txt,Rachel,"Well first, for forgetting to throw you a bridal shower.",78
S07E19 Ross And Monicas Cousin.txt,Phoebe,And then for forgetting to invite you to it.,78
S07E19 Ross And Monicas Cousin.txt,Monica,You al-you already had it?,78
S07E19 Ross And Monicas Cousin.txt,Phoebe,"Yeah. Well, we called everyone in your phone book and bunch of people came, but it took us so long to get you here that they-they had to leave.",78
S07E19 Ross And Monicas Cousin.txt,Rachel,"Yeah, we wanted to throw you a big surprise and a great shower, and now you don’t have either.",78
S07E19 Ross And Monicas Cousin.txt,Phoebe,We ruined everything.,78
S07E19 Ross And Monicas Cousin.txt,Rachel,Ugh…,78
S07E19 Ross And Monicas Cousin.txt,Monica,"Well no wait a minute that’s not true! No, what did, that was really sweet. And it kinda works out for the best.",78
S07E19 Ross And Monicas Cousin.txt,Rachel,"What do you, what do you mean?",78

S08E22 Rachel Is Late.txt,Rachel,"Well obviously I won’t be able to come, for those of you who haven’t checked their calendars today is my due date. Well y’know, I just want to take a moment and thank you guys for how great you’ve been during this time. I really couldn’t have done it without you. And I have loved these last nine months! And even though I am so looking forward to the next part, I am really gonna miss being pregnant.",3
S08E22 Rachel Is Late.txt,Rachel,You. Like you haven’t done enough.,6

S08E22 Rachel Is Late.txt,Rachel,Do you want me to come over there and sit on you? ‘Cause I’ll do it.,12
S08E22 Rachel Is Late.txt,Monica,What are you doing here so early?,12
S08E22 Rachel Is Late.txt,Rachel,"They sent me home from work. They were like, ""Start your maternity leave now! Just rest, get ready for the baby."" Well y’know what? Screw ‘em! If they don’t want me there, I’ll just hang out with you guys.",12
S08E22 Rachel Is Late.txt,Phoebe,Or you can do volunteer work.,12
S08E22 Rachel Is Late.txt,Joey,Hello?,13

S08E22 Rachel Is Late.txt,Joey,You said you didn’t want to go.,16
S08E22 Rachel Is Late.txt,Rachel,I don’t. But I would still like to be acknowledged. What? Just because I’m pregnant you think I’m invisible.,16
S08E22 Rachel Is Late.txt,Joey,Definitely not invisible.,16
S08E22 Rachel Is Late.txt,Monica,"Well, well Ross didn’t care enough to be here, so I think he’s out. You snooze you lose.",16
S08E22 Rachel Is Late.txt,Chandler,"He’s not snoozing, he’s teaching a class.",16

S08E22 Rachel Is Late.txt,Joey,Well uh…I think I want to take Chandler.,18
S08E22 Rachel Is Late.txt,Chandler,You really want to take me?,19
S08E22 Rachel Is Late.txt,Joey,"Yeah! Yeah! I mean I’m sorry, I wish I can take everybody, but y’know Chandler always supported my career. He’s paid for acting classes and head shots and stuff and well this will be my way of paying you back.",19
S08E22 Rachel Is Late.txt,Chandler,So you’re never actually going to pay me back?,19
S08E22 Rachel Is Late.txt,Monica,"Wait a minute, just because he paid for your head shots you’re gonna take him? Joey, I don’t think you’re comprehending just how slutty this dress is!",19
S08E22 Rachel Is Late.txt,Joey,"It’s not just the stuff he paid for, I mean it’s-it’s everything. Y’know? He read lines with me. He-he went with me on auditions when I was really nervous, and then he consoled me after I didn’t get parts that I really wanted. You always believed in me man. Even, even when I didn’t believe in myself.",19
S08E22 Rachel Is Late.txt,Chandler,I always knew you were gonna make it. I’m so proud of you.,19
S08E22 Rachel Is Late.txt,Joey,Thanks. That means a lot to me.,19
S08E22 Rachel Is Late.txt,Phoebe,"Mon, maybe one of these guys wants to wear your dress.",20
S08E22 Rachel Is Late.txt,Monica,"She’s over a week late! She gotta have it today, right?",24
S08E22 Rachel Is Late.txt,Phoebe,I don’t know. I-I think it’s still gonna be a while.,24

S08E22 Rachel Is Late.txt,Phoebe,You’re on!,24
S08E22 Rachel Is Late.txt,Monica,"Okay, how much?",24
S08E22 Rachel Is Late.txt,Phoebe,One hundred thousand dollars!,24
S08E22 Rachel Is Late.txt,Monica,How about fifty bucks?,24
S08E22 Rachel Is Late.txt,Phoebe,Fine! I’ll call Zurich and move some money around.,24
S08E22 Rachel Is Late.txt,Chandler,This is so exciting! It’s so glamorous! People taking our picture. How do I look?,28
S08E22 Rachel Is Late.txt,Joey,A little tall.,28

S08E22 Rachel Is Late.txt,Ross,"Rach, we gotta go.",34
S08E22 Rachel Is Late.txt,Rachel,In a minute!!!,34
S08E22 Rachel Is Late.txt,Ross,"People ask me why we’re not together, I just don’t know what to tell them.",34
S08E22 Rachel Is Late.txt,Ross,"Uh, do you wanna go change first? The doctor’s keeping the office open late for us, but if you hurry…",35

S08E22 Rachel Is Late.txt,Rachel,Well then you just must have a natural talent for it.,41
S08E22 Rachel Is Late.txt,Ross,"Y’know what? The doctor will be in soon, why don’t we not speak until then.",41
S08E22 Rachel Is Late.txt,Ross,Y’know we should probably ask the doctor if she even knows how to deliver a baby that’s half human and half pure evil!,42
S08E22 Rachel Is Late.txt,Rachel,"Hi Dr. Long, how are you?",43
S08E22 Rachel Is Late.txt,Rachel,She has the drugs!,44

S08E22 Rachel Is Late.txt,Phoebe,"Oh I-I don’t know about that. No, I think that if the two of you had sex the-the-the repercussions would be catastrophic.",51
S08E22 Rachel Is Late.txt,Monica,"All right, let’s be practical, if Ross isn’t willing to do it, he’s not the only guy in the world you can have sex with. You can borrow Chandler—Chandler is good!",51
S08E22 Rachel Is Late.txt,Ross,"Monica, what is the matter with you?",51
S08E22 Rachel Is Late.txt,Monica,Nothing. I just want the baby to be born today.,51
S08E22 Rachel Is Late.txt,Rachel,Why? Why today?,51
S08E22 Rachel Is Late.txt,Monica,Okay fine! I keep betting Phoebe that you’re gonna have the baby and I don’t want to lose again!,51

S08E22 Rachel Is Late.txt,Chandler,I’m so sorry.,55
S08E22 Rachel Is Late.txt,Joey,"Uh-huh look, the only reason I can over here was to settle things between us! Okay? You’ve done a lot for me and my career, I wanted to pay you back so I took you to the premiere but you missed it! Okay, so how much do I owe you?",55
S08E22 Rachel Is Late.txt,Chandler,What?!,55

S08E22 Rachel Is Late.txt,Chandler,Uh then there was that dialect coach who helped you with that play where you needed a southern accent. Which after twenty hours of lessons still came out Jamaican.,57
S08E22 Rachel Is Late.txt,Chandler,"Yes, money well spent!",58

S08E22 Rachel Is Late.txt,Ross,"Come on, finish your enchilada.",59
S08E22 Rachel Is Late.txt,Rachel,Ross I—We tried all the spicy food. It’s not working.,59

S08E22 Rachel Is Late.txt,Rachel,"Oh come on Ross, we’ve done it before we’ll do it again, it’ll be a nice way to bookend the pregnancy.",60
S08E22 Rachel Is Late.txt,Ross,"This is insane, I’m not gonna make love to you just so that you’ll go into labor.",60
S08E22 Rachel Is Late.txt,Rachel,Make love? What are you a girl?,60
S08E22 Rachel Is Late.txt,Ross,Always a great way to get in a man’s pants.,60
S08E22 Rachel Is Late.txt,Rachel,"But you will, you will be performing a service. Okay? Just-just think of me as a ketchup bottle, y’know you sometimes you have to bang on the end of it just to get something to come out.",60
S08E22 Rachel Is Late.txt,Ross,I love when you talk dirty to me.,60
S08E22 Rachel Is Late.txt,Ross,"Okay enough! This is, this is not going to happen.",61

S01E11 Mrs. Bing.txt,Chandler,"Yes, well, I expect this from her. Okay? She's always been a Freudian nightmare.",77
S01E11 Mrs. Bing.txt,Ross,"Okay, well, if she always behaves like this, why don't you say something?",77
S01E11 Mrs. Bing.txt,Chandler,"Because it's complicated, it's complex- Hey, you kissed my mom!",77
S01E11 Mrs. Bing.txt,Chandler,That's very funny. We done now?,79
S01E11 Mrs. Bing.txt,Ross,"No! Okay, you mean, you're not gonna talk to her, you're not gonna tell her how you feel?",79
S01E11 Mrs. Bing.txt,Chandler,"That would be no. Look, just because you played tonsil tennis with my mom doesn't mean you know her. Alright? Trust me, you can't talk to her.",79
S01E11 Mrs. Bing.txt,Phoebe,"Alright, whadyou do with him?",81

S01E11 Mrs. Bing.txt,Phoebe,"What, that's it?",83
S01E11 Mrs. Bing.txt,Monica,"""See you around?""",83
S01E11 Mrs. Bing.txt,Monica,"Oh, I don't know. Maybe, um, ""That was nice?"" Admit something to me? ""I'll call you?""",83
S01E11 Mrs. Bing.txt,Phoebe,I don't think you mean that.,83
S01E11 Mrs. Bing.txt,Monica,"This is so typical. Y'know, we give, and we give, and we give. And then- we just get nothing back! And then one day, y'know, it's just, you wake up, and ""See you around!"" Let's go, Phoebe.",83
S01E11 Mrs. Bing.txt,Phoebe,Y'know what? We thought you were different. But I guess it was just the coma.,83
S01E11 Mrs. Bing.txt,Chandler,"No, just knowing you're gonna be there is enough.",84
S01E11 Mrs. Bing.txt,Chandler,You kissed my best Ross! ...Or something to that effect.,85
S01E11 Mrs. Bing.txt,Chandler,Really stupid.,86

S01E11 Mrs. Bing.txt,Ross,You're kidding.,87
S01E11 Mrs. Bing.txt,Joey,"No, no. He said ""When are you gonna grow up and start being a mom?""",87
S01E11 Mrs. Bing.txt,Ross,Wow!,87
S01E11 Mrs. Bing.txt,Joey,"Then she came back with ""The question is, when are you gonna grow up and realise I have a bomb?""",87
S01E11 Mrs. Bing.txt,Ross,"'Kay, wait a minute, are you sure she didn't say ""When are you gonna grow up and realise I am your mom?""",87
S01E11 Mrs. Bing.txt,Joey,That makes more sense.,87
S01E11 Mrs. Bing.txt,Ross,"So, what's going on now?",87
S01E11 Mrs. Bing.txt,Ross,Whaddya see?,88

S01E11 Mrs. Bing.txt,Joey,You usually find them on the 'heaving beasts'.,97
S01E11 Mrs. Bing.txt,Rachel,"Alright, alright, so I'm not a great typist...",97
S01E11 Mrs. Bing.txt,Ross,"Wait, did you get to the part about his 'huge throbbing pens'? Tell ya, you don't wanna be around when he starts writing with those!",97
S01E11 Mrs. Bing.txt,Rachel,"Alright, that's it! Give it back! That's it!",97

S07E12 Theyre Up All Night.txt,Tag,"Rach, I’m sorry, but you didn’t give me any contracts!",45
S07E12 Theyre Up All Night.txt,Rachel,"Yes I did! And I put a little Post-It on it that said, ""Must go out today,"" and underlined today three times and, and then I put a little heart in the corner because I didn’t want to seem to bossy.",45
S07E12 Theyre Up All Night.txt,Tag,"I’m telling you, you never gave them to me.",45
S07E12 Theyre Up All Night.txt,Rachel,"Y’know what Tag, if we went down to the office you would see those contracts sitting on your desk.",45
S07E12 Theyre Up All Night.txt,Tag,"No, I would see you looking embarrassed because they are not on my desk!",45
S07E12 Theyre Up All Night.txt,Rachel,Or maybe you would see me looking embarrassed because you are talking on the phone with your crotch!,45
S07E12 Theyre Up All Night.txt,Tag,You wanna go down to the office right now?,45

S07E12 Theyre Up All Night.txt,Tag,So when do you imagine you gave them to me? In the morning or in the afternoon?,60
S07E12 Theyre Up All Night.txt,Tag,It’s not here.,62
S07E12 Theyre Up All Night.txt,Rachel,"Puzzler. A bit of a puzzle. Why don’t you um, check the copy room, maybe you left the contracts in there?",62
S07E12 Theyre Up All Night.txt,Tag,How could I have left them in the copy room?,62
S07E12 Theyre Up All Night.txt,Rachel,I don’t know Tag! How can your genitals make phone calls? Okay? It’s not a perfect world! Just go please.,62
S07E12 Theyre Up All Night.txt,Tag,Fine.,62

S07E12 Theyre Up All Night.txt,Joey,All right.,89
S07E12 Theyre Up All Night.txt,Ross,"I prefer not to answer that right now, I’m still carrying a little holiday weight.",91
S07E12 Theyre Up All Night.txt,Joey,"Y’know, when we talked about face to face, I don’t think we thought it all the way through.",92
S07E12 Theyre Up All Night.txt,Ross,So what do you want me to do?,92
S07E12 Theyre Up All Night.txt,Joey,"Well, just shimmy down me and drop!",92
S07E12 Theyre Up All Night.txt,Ross,Hi.,93

S07E12 Theyre Up All Night.txt,Chandler,Do you wanna?,99
S07E12 Theyre Up All Night.txt,Monica,Okay! You get the vacuum cleaner and I’ll get the furniture polish!,99

S06E10 The Routine.txt,Rachel,"That’s a good story, Grandpa.",2
S06E10 The Routine.txt,Ross,Hey,3
S06E10 The Routine.txt,All,Hey,3
S06E10 The Routine.txt,Ross,"Wow, Monica’s letting other people help decorate her tree! Did someone get her drunk again or?",3
S06E10 The Routine.txt,Monica,Having a perfectly decorated tree is not what Christmas is about. It’s about being with the people that you love.,3
S06E10 The Routine.txt,Phoebe,That is nice and we’re done. TADA!,3
S06E10 The Routine.txt,Chandler,"I dunno what it is, it just doesn’t quite feel like Christmas to me.",4
S06E10 The Routine.txt,Monica,"Oh, here.",4
S06E10 The Routine.txt,Chandler,See now it feels like Christmas!,5
S06E10 The Routine.txt,Ross,"… and that’s the story of the dreidle. Now, some people trace the Christmas tree back to the Egyptians, who used to bring green palm branches into their huts on the shortest day of the year, symbolising life’s triumph over death. And that was like 4000 years ago.",6
S06E10 The Routine.txt,Rachel,"So, pretty much around the same time that you started telling this story.",6
S06E10 The Routine.txt,Joey,Hey you guys.,7
S06E10 The Routine.txt,Chandler,Hey Joe what’s up?,7
S06E10 The Routine.txt,Chandler,I can see why that’s hard to resist.,8
S06E10 The Routine.txt,Joey,I like her so much!,8
S06E10 The Routine.txt,Monica,"Aw, I’m sorry sweetie that she doesn’t feel the same way.",8
S06E10 The Routine.txt,Joey,I know. And she’s so sweet. I just wanna feed her grapes and brush her hair.,8
S06E10 The Routine.txt,Chandler,"You are aware that she’s not a monkey, right?",8
S06E10 The Routine.txt,Ross,"I am so over Janine. I mean, yeah, at first I thought she was hot, but now she’s like OLD NEWS!",8
S06E10 The Routine.txt,Janine,Hey guys!,9
S06E10 The Routine.txt,Ross,Hi Janine!,9
S06E10 The Routine.txt,Janine,I just got a call to be a dancer on a television special for New Year’s Eve. It’s called some sort of Dick’n Rock’n Dickie Eve.,9
S06E10 The Routine.txt,Monica,Hold it! Are you talking about Dick Clark’s New Year’s Rocking Eve?,9
S06E10 The Routine.txt,Janine,"Yeah, that’s what I said.",9
S06E10 The Routine.txt,Monica,Oh my God! We love that show! I mean Ross and I have been watching it since I can remember!,9

S06E10 The Routine.txt,Joey,Totally! I would love to spend New Year’s with you.,11
S06E10 The Routine.txt,Janine,Well actually they’re taping tomorrow. I don’t really understand why.,11
S06E10 The Routine.txt,Ross,"Oh, well you see how it works is, the part with Dick Clark in Times Square is actually live, but they tape some of the party stuff ahead of time. Yeah, not a lot of people know that.",11
S06E10 The Routine.txt,Janine,"Yeah well, do you guys wanna come too?",11
S06E10 The Routine.txt,Ross,Are you serious?,11
S06E10 The Routine.txt,Monica,We are there!,11
S06E10 The Routine.txt,Chandler,"What, what are you laughing at?",12
S06E10 The Routine.txt,Rachel,"Well, I used to date him, but you’re still going out with her!",12
S06E10 The Routine.txt,All,Bye!,15
S06E10 The Routine.txt,Ross,Bye Janine!,15
S06E10 The Routine.txt,Joey,Did she just ask me out on a date?,15
S06E10 The Routine.txt,Chandler,I don’t think so.,15
S06E10 The Routine.txt,Monica,What are you talking about? She just invited him to the biggest party of the millennium!,15
S06E10 The Routine.txt,Rachel,"Yeah, but she also invited you and Ross. Yeah, honey, I’m sorry, but I don’t think that was a romantic thing.",15
S06E10 The Routine.txt,Joey,"Oh. Maybe. But hey I know how I can find out. We’re going to a New Year’s Eve party, right? So at midnight, I can kiss her. And if she kisses me back, great! Y’know? But if she says ‘Dude, what the hell are you doing?’ I can say ‘It wasn’t me, it was New Years!’",15
S06E10 The Routine.txt,Rachel,"Well, that’s a lot better than Ross trying to kiss me in High School, and saying that he did it because he needed chapstick.",15
S06E10 The Routine.txt,Ross,It was a dry day.,15
S06E10 The Routine.txt,Monica,We are going to Dick Clark’s New Year’s Rocking Eve!,15
S06E10 The Routine.txt,Ross,Oh my God!,15
S06E10 The Routine.txt,Monica,Oh my God!,15
S06E10 The Routine.txt,Joey,"OK, listen I’ve been on sets before, so let me give you a little advice, alright? It’s a show, but we’re just dancing, OK? It’s no big deal. The important thing to remember – stay cool.",17
S06E10 The Routine.txt,Ross,Got it!,17
S06E10 The Routine.txt,Ross,Oh my God it’s just like I dreamed it!,18
S06E10 The Routine.txt,Director,"OK, everyone gather up.",18
S06E10 The Routine.txt,Director,"Here’s what’s gonna happen. The music’s gonna start, you’re gonna dance, we’re gonna tape, you don’t look at the camera. Any questions?",19
S06E10 The Routine.txt,Ross,"Yeah, I have a question. When is this gonna air?",19
S06E10 The Routine.txt,Director,"Uh, yeah. Now you guys dance over there, you guys over there, and I want you two right around here, and everyone else spread out.",20
S06E10 The Routine.txt,Joey,Ross! So when is it gonna air?,20
S06E10 The Routine.txt,Rachel,"Okay, you look in the kitchen, I will look in the back closet.",21
S06E10 The Routine.txt,Chandler,"I can save you time ladies, I’m right here.",21
S06E10 The Routine.txt,Phoebe,"Yeah, Chandler why don’t you take a walk? This doesn’t concern you.",21
S06E10 The Routine.txt,Rachel,We are looking for our Christmas presents from Monica.,21
S06E10 The Routine.txt,Chandler,What? That’s terrible!,21
S06E10 The Routine.txt,Phoebe,"No-no, we do it every year!",21
S06E10 The Routine.txt,Chandler,"Oh well, that makes it not terrible.",21
S06E10 The Routine.txt,Phoebe,"No, yeah, we never find them! She’s always best at us that wily minx.",21
S06E10 The Routine.txt,Rachel,"Don’t worry, we’re just gonna search here for an hour, them we’re gonna go over to Joey’s and search, OK?",21
S06E10 The Routine.txt,Chandler,"No not okay, you can’t look for Monica’s presents!",21
S06E10 The Routine.txt,Phoebe,But we have to!,21

S06E10 The Routine.txt,Chandler,"Yes, if the presents are hidden south for the winter.",59
S06E10 The Routine.txt,Phoebe,"Or we could just follow your clever jokes – any ideas? No! Didn’t think so! Okay, c’mon guys, show us where the presents are!",59
S06E10 The Routine.txt,Chandler,"Oh, the duck seems to think that Monica got me garbage! Hmm, I wonder what I could get Monica that’s as good as garbage?",59

S06E10 The Routine.txt,Chandler,"I don’t wanna know what Monica got me. Y’know? I mean, look, I’m sure she worked really hard at getting you a present, and wanting to surprise me, and you guys are gonna ruin that, and I, look we have to put these back, this is not what Christmas is about.",61
S06E10 The Routine.txt,Rachel,"Whatever Linus, I’m opening mine.",61
S06E10 The Routine.txt,Chandler,"Nobody is opening anything ok? Look, I don’t know about you guys, but I wanna see the look on Monica’s face when I give her my present, and I’m sure she wants to see the look on my face when I get mine. So please, please, can we just, can we put them back?",61

S06E10 The Routine.txt,Monica,"We were on the platform, ready to dance the world into the new Millennium, and the guy yelled ‘CUT!’",67
S06E10 The Routine.txt,Rachel,"Uh, wait, so you guys are telling me you actually did the routine from eighth grade?",67
S06E10 The Routine.txt,Rachel,‘Cos I was gonna say there’s no way you could’ve done the end the way you guys did it back then!,68
S06E10 The Routine.txt,Monica,What? We could do it!,68
S06E10 The Routine.txt,Ross,"I don’t know, I mean you were a lot bigger, I mean, stronger back then.",68

S05E16 The Cop.txt,Ross,"Yeah, you got it right? You got it right? You got it?",41
S05E16 The Cop.txt,Rachel,Any chance you think the couch looks good there?,42
S05E16 The Cop.txt,Phoebe,I know but I'm having so much fun doing good deeds.,45
S05E16 The Cop.txt,Chandler,"Okay, but impersonating a police officer is a serious thing. You could get arrested.",45
S05E16 The Cop.txt,Chandler,"Hi, Joe.",48
S05E16 The Cop.txt,Joey,"Yeah, I didn’t know you guys were going to be here.",48
S05E16 The Cop.txt,Monica,What is going on with you?,50

S05E16 The Cop.txt,Chandler,"Oh, come on! You've been acting strange all day!",50
S05E16 The Cop.txt,Joey,"Well, it involved Monica.",52
S05E16 The Cop.txt,Joey,"Don't worry, there wasn't any sex in it or anything. I haven't dreamt about her like that since I found out about you two--ish.",53
S05E16 The Cop.txt,Monica,What was the dream about?,53
S05E16 The Cop.txt,Joey,"Well, okay. You were my girlfriend and we were doing the crossword puzzle. Y'know like you guys were doing last night. So, that's it. I'm in love with Monica and I'll be moving out.",53
S05E16 The Cop.txt,Monica,"Wait, Joey! Joey! That doesn’t mean that-that you're in love with me!",53
S05E16 The Cop.txt,Joey,It-it doesn’t?,53
S05E16 The Cop.txt,Monica,No!,53
S05E16 The Cop.txt,Chandler,"No, it can mean anything. Like uh, all of the sudden you're jealous because I've become the apartment stud.",53
S05E16 The Cop.txt,Joey,That kinda sounds like your dream dude.,53
S05E16 The Cop.txt,Monica,"Or, it could mean that-that you saw Chandler and me together and we y'know were being close and stuff and then you just want to have that with someone too.",53
S05E16 The Cop.txt,Joey,In the dream I did enjoy the closeness.,53
S05E16 The Cop.txt,Monica,Um-hmm.,53
S05E16 The Cop.txt,Chandler,"Joey, look, are you attracted to Monica? Right here, right now, are you attracted to her?",53
S05E16 The Cop.txt,Chandler,Well there you have it!,54
S05E16 The Cop.txt,Joey,"No, I don't think it's just about just getting a girlfriend. Y'know? I mean, yeah, I can get a girlfriend! Yeah, we could sit in the chair and do crosswords, but y'know are we ever going to have y'know the closeness like-like you guys have?",55
S05E16 The Cop.txt,Chandler,"Well y'know, Monica and I were friends before we started dating. So maybe-maybe that's it?",55
S05E16 The Cop.txt,Joey,Friends first? That's interesting.,55
S05E16 The Cop.txt,Monica,You become friends after?,55
S05E16 The Cop.txt,Joey,"No, never done that either.",55
S05E16 The Cop.txt,Chandler,"Oh yeah, it's actually in my bedroom.",56
S05E16 The Cop.txt,Phoebe,"Excuse me, is this your car?",63
S05E16 The Cop.txt,Guy,Yeah.,63
S05E16 The Cop.txt,Phoebe,"Well I don't think it's very nice of you to park here, y'know you're blocking the entrance.",63
S05E16 The Cop.txt,Guy,Don't worry about it. It's not a problem.,63
S05E16 The Cop.txt,Phoebe,"I-I'm with the umm, the 57th.",67
S05E16 The Cop.txt,Cop,"Oh, I know a guy in homicide up there.",67
S05E16 The Cop.txt,Phoebe,"I'm in vice. Yeah, in fact I'm undercover right now. I'm a whore.",67
S05E16 The Cop.txt,Cop,Who-who else is in vice up there?,67
S05E16 The Cop.txt,Phoebe,"Umm, do you know, umm Sipowicz?",67
S05E16 The Cop.txt,Cop,"Sipowicz? No, I don't think so.",67
S05E16 The Cop.txt,Phoebe,"Yeah, big guy, kinda bald.",67
S05E16 The Cop.txt,Cop,"No, I don't know him.",67
S05E16 The Cop.txt,Cop,"Wow umm, tell Sipowicz I'm real sorry for his loss.",68
S05E16 The Cop.txt,Rachel,"Hey! Joey, would you mind giving me and Ross a hand moving his couch?",72
S05E16 The Cop.txt,Rachel,Thanks!,74
S05E16 The Cop.txt,Joey,"Uh, hey, Rach let me ask you something. Uh, I was just over there talking to Monica and Chandler, boy they are really tight.",74
S05E16 The Cop.txt,Rachel,I know.,74
S05E16 The Cop.txt,Joey,Yeah that's not such a bad situation they got going over there. I'm thinking of getting me one of those.,74
S05E16 The Cop.txt,Rachel,What's up Joe?,74
S05E16 The Cop.txt,Joey,"Well, the reason I think Monica and Chandler are so great…",74
S05E16 The Cop.txt,Rachel,Yeah?,74
S05E16 The Cop.txt,Joey,"…is because they were friends first. Y'know? So I asked myself, ""Who are my friends?"" You and Phoebe, and I saw you first. So…",74
S05E16 The Cop.txt,Joey,I'm saying maybe you and I crank it up a notch.,75
S05E16 The Cop.txt,Rachel,"Y'know honey, umm, as uh, as flattered as I am that uh, you saw me first, uhh, I just, I-I don't think we should be cranking anything up.",75
S05E16 The Cop.txt,Joey,Won't-won't that take longer?,77
S05E16 The Cop.txt,Rachel,"Yeah. Yeah. Oh, but once you find it, ohh it's so worth the wait.",77
S05E16 The Cop.txt,Ross,"Come here to me. No-no, you come here to me.",79
S05E16 The Cop.txt,Ross,"Oh great! What, you brought Joey?",80
S05E16 The Cop.txt,Rachel,"Well, I brought the next best thing.",80
S05E16 The Cop.txt,Ross,Chandler?! You brought Chandler?! The next best thing would be Monica!,81
S05E16 The Cop.txt,Chandler,"Y'know, I would be offended, but Monica is freakishly strong, so…",81
S05E16 The Cop.txt,Ross,"Oh, that's me.",83
S05E16 The Cop.txt,Rachel,Wow! You certainly think a lot of yourself.,83
S05E16 The Cop.txt,Ross,No! That's-that's my arm!,83
S05E16 The Cop.txt,Ross,Y'know what? Just-just follow my lead.,84
S05E16 The Cop.txt,Rachel,Okay!,85
S05E16 The Cop.txt,Chandler,Okay.,85

S05E16 The Cop.txt,Ross,"All right, ready?",88
S05E16 The Cop.txt,Chandler,Yeah.,88
S05E16 The Cop.txt,Ross,Turn.,88
S05E16 The Cop.txt,Ross,Turn! Turn!,89
S05E16 The Cop.txt,Chandler,"Okay, I don't think we can turn anymore!",90
S05E16 The Cop.txt,Rachel,"Ross, I don't, I just don't think it's going to fit.",90
S05E16 The Cop.txt,Chandler,Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!!,91
S05E16 The Cop.txt,Ross,"Okay, I don't think it's going to pivot anymore.",92
S05E16 The Cop.txt,Ross,"All right, let's uh, let's bring it back down and-and try again.",92
S05E16 The Cop.txt,Chandler,"Okay, yeah, I think it's really stuck now.",93
S05E16 The Cop.txt,Ross,I can't believe that didn't work!,93
S05E16 The Cop.txt,Rachel,"I know, me neither! I mean, you had a sketch!",93
S05E16 The Cop.txt,Chandler,"Oh, y'know, what did you mean when you said pivot?",93
S05E16 The Cop.txt,Rachel,Hey! How's it going? Did you make any new friends?,95
S05E16 The Cop.txt,Joey,"Uhh, well, she's…really good in bed.",97
S05E16 The Cop.txt,Monica,"Joey, I thought you were gonna try to be friends first!",97
S05E16 The Cop.txt,Rachel,What?! Why?!,98
S05E16 The Cop.txt,Monica,What about the closeness?,99
S05E16 The Cop.txt,Joey,Closeness-shmoshness! There was three of us for crying out loud!,99
S05E16 The Cop.txt,Chandler,"Ooh, I do! I do! I do!",101

S05E16 The Cop.txt,Phoebe,Yep! As long as you understand that I'm going to call my lawyer and once he puts you on the stand he'll make you look like a fool. A fool!,106
S05E16 The Cop.txt,Cop,"I don't like looking foolish. Y'know what? Maybe uh, I don't arrest you today. Maybe I came by and you weren't here.",106
S05E16 The Cop.txt,Phoebe,I would love it if I weren't here!,106
S05E16 The Cop.txt,Cop,"Okay, so since umm, you're not going to jail tonight I was wondering if you would like to go to dinner with me?",106
S05E16 The Cop.txt,Phoebe,Me?!,106
S05E16 The Cop.txt,Cop,"Yeah. Ever since you flashed my badge at me, I kinda can't stop thinking about you. You're the prettiest, fake undercover whore I've ever seen.",106

S06E23 The Ring.txt,Phoebe,"Now, have you told anyone else?",3
S06E23 The Ring.txt,Chandler,"No, I don’t want to tell anybody else because I don’t want Monica to find out.",3
S06E23 The Ring.txt,Phoebe,You told me.,3
S06E23 The Ring.txt,Chandler,"Well, it’s because I trust you, you’re one of my best friends, and you walked in on me when I was looking at ring brochures.",3
S06E23 The Ring.txt,Phoebe,"Yeah well, once again not knocking pays off. I only wish you hadn’t been on the toilet.",3
S06E23 The Ring.txt,Chandler,Me too.,3

S06E23 The Ring.txt,Chandler,"Oh well, we don’t because we got…the…other pl-place.",5
S06E23 The Ring.txt,Ross,How rude.,6
S06E23 The Ring.txt,Phoebe,So how are things going with Paul?,8
S06E23 The Ring.txt,Rachel,"Good. Although y’know, he-he’s a private guy. Y’know, I wish I could get him to open up a little bit, share some feelings.",8
S06E23 The Ring.txt,Phoebe,That’s easy! You just have to think of him as a-as a jar of pickles that won’t open.,8
S06E23 The Ring.txt,Rachel,So what are you saying; I should run him under hot water and bang his head against a table?,8
S06E23 The Ring.txt,Phoebe,No that’s what you do when you want to get the truth out of someone.,8
S06E23 The Ring.txt,Rachel,Hi!,9
S06E23 The Ring.txt,Phoebe,Hi Paul!,12
S06E23 The Ring.txt,Paul,Hi Phoebe.,12

S06E23 The Ring.txt,Ross,How you doing?,17
S06E23 The Ring.txt,Ross,Okay! You take care!,18
S06E23 The Ring.txt,Ross,"Hey Pheebs, what-what was the deal with you and Chandler blowing us off before?",19
S06E23 The Ring.txt,Phoebe,"Yeah! That was so weird, huh?",19
S06E23 The Ring.txt,Ross,"Phoebe, why’d you do it?",19
S06E23 The Ring.txt,Phoebe,I didn’t do it! It was Chandler! He’s… He’s mad at you!,19
S06E23 The Ring.txt,Ross,What?! Why?!,19
S06E23 The Ring.txt,Phoebe,"Please, I think you know why.",19
S06E23 The Ring.txt,Ross,I can’t think of anything.,19
S06E23 The Ring.txt,Phoebe,"Come on Ross, you’re a paleontologist, dig a little deeper.",19
S06E23 The Ring.txt,Ross,"Wait a minute, is it because Joey and I didn’t invite him to that Knicks game a couple of weeks ago?",19
S06E23 The Ring.txt,Phoebe,Do you think that’s something that he’d be mad at you for?,19
S06E23 The Ring.txt,Ross,I guess it could.,19
S06E23 The Ring.txt,Phoebe,Well then I think that’s it.,19
S06E23 The Ring.txt,Ross,"Well, if he’s angry, he really shouldn’t just cover it up. I-I wish he would just tell me the truth.",19
S06E23 The Ring.txt,Phoebe,"Oh, if that’s what you want you then you really should run his head under hot water and bang his head against a table.",19
S06E23 The Ring.txt,Paul,"Honey I made a reservation at China Garden, is that okay?",20
S06E23 The Ring.txt,Rachel,"Yeah that’s great. But first, wait, talk to me, talk to me. Tell me about your day.",20
S06E23 The Ring.txt,Paul,It was fine.,20
S06E23 The Ring.txt,Rachel,"Okay. Hey, what are you thinking? What are you thinking right now?",20
S06E23 The Ring.txt,Paul,I’m thinking that you are looking really fine it that dress.,20
S06E23 The Ring.txt,Paul,Are you talking about having sex?,21
S06E23 The Ring.txt,Rachel,"No Paul, I don’t know anything about you! Y’know, like-like your childhood! Tell me about your childhood!",21
S06E23 The Ring.txt,Paul,Normal.,21
S06E23 The Ring.txt,Rachel,"Okay, well then how about puberty! Come on, that’s always a painful time! Y’know your friends invite you to a slumber party and then they stick your hand in warm water while you’re sleeping so that you pee in your sleeping bag.",21
S06E23 The Ring.txt,Paul,Nope! That never happened to me!,21
S06E23 The Ring.txt,Rachel,"Well, you’re lucky you never met that bitch Sharon Majesky. Anyway, umm… The rest of you life, y’know? Any regrets?",21
S06E23 The Ring.txt,Paul,Nope.,21
S06E23 The Ring.txt,Rachel,"All right Paul, I’m not asking for a lot here. Okay? Just give me something. Anything!",21
S06E23 The Ring.txt,Paul,Okay.,21
S06E23 The Ring.txt,Rachel,Okay.,21
S06E23 The Ring.txt,Paul,Okay.,21
S06E23 The Ring.txt,Rachel,All right.,21
S06E23 The Ring.txt,Paul,When I was six years old.,21
S06E23 The Ring.txt,Rachel,Hm-mmm.,21
S06E23 The Ring.txt,Paul,I wanted a big wheel. And instead my parents got me this little plastic chicken that you hop around on. It was embarrassing; kids made fun of me. That was a pretty tough year.,21
S06E23 The Ring.txt,Paul,It was horrible. They called me chicken boy.,22
S06E23 The Ring.txt,Rachel,Oh!,22
S06E23 The Ring.txt,Rachel,"Yeah. Yeah, I-I-I see the scare. Listen, Paul, I think this is really great that-that y’know, you shared your feelings. It’s really, it’s beautiful, but umm, what do you say we go share some food?",24
S06E23 The Ring.txt,Paul,"Oh, I couldn’t eat now.",24
S06E23 The Ring.txt,Rachel,What?! Wait! What are you talking about?! You love their Kung Pao Chicken!,24
S06E23 The Ring.txt,Rachel,"My God, I’m sorry! I’m sorry! I didn’t mean to do that! I wouldn’t do that!",25
S06E23 The Ring.txt,Phoebe,"Okay, so maybe you don’t get her a ring. Maybe you-maybe you do something different. Y’know? Maybe you get her an engagement bracelet, y’know? Or an engagement tiara? Or—ooh! An engagement Revolutionary War musket! (Picks one up from the display in the corner.",28
S06E23 The Ring.txt,Chandler,"Y’know, I’m so glad I picked you to help me with this.",28
S06E23 The Ring.txt,Phoebe,Huh? Can you just imagine getting down on one knee and handing her this gorgeous piece of weaponry?,28
S06E23 The Ring.txt,Chandler,"Uh-uh, yes. I would like to see that ring please.",30
S06E23 The Ring.txt,Phoebe,"Or not, whatever.",30
S06E23 The Ring.txt,Chandler,"Sir, can I ask you to umm, could you…hold out that ring and ask me to marry you?",30
S06E23 The Ring.txt,Phoebe,We will give you $10.,33
S06E23 The Ring.txt,Chandler,"Yes! Yes, but I can only pay $8,000.",34
S06E23 The Ring.txt,Phoebe,We stand firm at $10.,34
S06E23 The Ring.txt,Phoebe,I’ll give you $1 for them.,38
S06E23 The Ring.txt,Ross,"Hey, remember how Chandler and Phoebe blew us off yesterday?",39
S06E23 The Ring.txt,Joey,No.,39
S06E23 The Ring.txt,Ross,Remember? You-you were eating pizza.,39
S06E23 The Ring.txt,Joey,Yeah.,39
S06E23 The Ring.txt,Ross,"Okay. Well, apparently Chandler’s angry at us for not getting him a ticket to that Knicks game a couple of weeks ago.",39
S06E23 The Ring.txt,Joey,"Oh, we’re supposed to just get him a ticket?! That guy is always mooching off of us!",39
S06E23 The Ring.txt,Ross,"Yeah! Anyway, I-I still think we should try to patch things up, y’know? Like uh, maybe we could get him to get tickets to another Knicks game and invite him.",39
S06E23 The Ring.txt,Joey,Oh wow that’s a great idea! And I still have his credit card.,39
S06E23 The Ring.txt,Ross,All the time?,42
S06E23 The Ring.txt,Joey,All the time!,42
S06E23 The Ring.txt,Rachel,Oh my God! Oh my God!!,43
S06E23 The Ring.txt,Monica,Still crying?,43
S06E23 The Ring.txt,Rachel,"Like a little girl. I know. I know. I know. This is all my fault; I wanted him to open up. But God, I didn’t know that I was gonna unleash this-this weepy, clingy, moist monster!",43
S06E23 The Ring.txt,Monica,"Y’know, I only know of two surefire ways to shut a man up. And one of them is sex.",43
S06E23 The Ring.txt,Rachel,What’s the other one?,43
S06E23 The Ring.txt,Monica,"I don’t know, I’ve never had to use the other one. I’m just saying y’know, if we’re having sex, he’s not gonna be talking.",43
S06E23 The Ring.txt,Monica,"Oh, we have some…",44
S06E23 The Ring.txt,Rachel,No you don’t!,44
S06E23 The Ring.txt,Paul,Rachel?,51
S06E23 The Ring.txt,Chandler,"No, did he hug you?!",53
S06E23 The Ring.txt,Paul,"No! No! It’s just that, my dad never did. I miss my dad.",53
S06E23 The Ring.txt,Chandler,"Well, you can see my dad in Vegas kissing other dads.",53
S06E23 The Ring.txt,Paul,Hey Chandler?,53
S06E23 The Ring.txt,Chandler,Yeah?,53
S06E23 The Ring.txt,Paul,Would you…….Would you hug me?,53
S06E23 The Ring.txt,Chandler,I’m a little busy here Paul.,53
S06E23 The Ring.txt,Paul,Five more seconds.,55
S06E23 The Ring.txt,Chandler,Do you have my credit card?,59
S06E23 The Ring.txt,Joey,Oh hey listen I got us tickets to a Knicks game tonight.,61
S06E23 The Ring.txt,Chandler,"Oh, I can’t go.",61
S06E23 The Ring.txt,Joey,"Come on! It’ll be fun! Me, you, and Ross, and… Paul probably…",61
S06E23 The Ring.txt,Chandler,"Oh, that’s uh, that’s pretty nice but I’m gonna go with the one I picked first.",63
S06E23 The Ring.txt,Phoebe,"Oh my God Chandler, the one you picked is gone. It’s over!",63
S06E23 The Ring.txt,Chandler,What?,63
S06E23 The Ring.txt,Chandler,They put you in jail?,64
S06E23 The Ring.txt,Phoebe,The little jail between the doors!,64
S06E23 The Ring.txt,Chandler,"Phoebe, I asked you to guard the ring!",64
S06E23 The Ring.txt,Phoebe,"I know, I’m sorry! But y’know, this ring is better! Monica never even saw the other ring.",64
S06E23 The Ring.txt,Chandler,Yeah but when he proposed to me with the ring I got goose bumps.,64
S06E23 The Ring.txt,Phoebe,Maybe it was the guy.,64
S06E23 The Ring.txt,Chandler,It was the ring!,64
S06E23 The Ring.txt,Ross,"Hey! So uh, was he excited about the tickets?",65
S06E23 The Ring.txt,Joey,No! He blew us off!,65
S06E23 The Ring.txt,Ross,What?!,65
S06E23 The Ring.txt,Joey,I know!,65
S06E23 The Ring.txt,Joey,Can I tell you something? Me too.,66
S06E23 The Ring.txt,Ross,"Y’know what? He didn’t want to talk to us about being angry, well maybe we don’t talk to him at all!",66
S06E23 The Ring.txt,Joey,Ooooh! Freeze him out.,66
S06E23 The Ring.txt,Ross,That’s right!,66
S06E23 The Ring.txt,Joey,I like it!,66
S06E23 The Ring.txt,Ross,Eh? We’ll show him!,66
S06E23 The Ring.txt,Rachel,Hi. I’m back.,68
S06E23 The Ring.txt,Paul,"Hey! I have so much more to tell ya, I’ve written it all down!",68
S06E23 The Ring.txt,Rachel,A lover?,70
S06E23 The Ring.txt,Paul,A surfer.,70
S06E23 The Ring.txt,Rachel,Oh yeah surfer?,70
S06E23 The Ring.txt,Paul,"I wanted to be one with the waves, y’know?",70
S06E23 The Ring.txt,Rachel,"I don’t care about the little dude! I can’t! I cannot listen to anymore of this! Y’know, the only person who would want to listen to this is a mental health professional! And then it’s only because they get paid $100 an hour! Do you know how much money I could’ve made listening to you? $2,000! And do you know when I figured that out? While you were talking!",72
S06E23 The Ring.txt,Paul,What?! I can’t believe you’re trying to stifle me! When just 14 hours ago we figured out that that is exactly what my mother was trying to do to me!,72
S06E23 The Ring.txt,Rachel,Oh… I’m sorry. I… I-I don’t mean—I didn’t mean to stifle you. I… This is all just a little overwhelming.,72
S06E23 The Ring.txt,Chandler,I can’t believe I let you talk me into buying this stupid gumball machine looking ring!,79
S06E23 The Ring.txt,Phoebe,It’s not a stupid gumball machine looking ring! It’s a beautiful ring!,79
S06E23 The Ring.txt,Phoebe,Okay. There may be a way that we can get the other ring back. ‘Cause I heard the guy tell the jeweler where he was going to propose. So maybe we can get him to trade rings or something.,80
S06E23 The Ring.txt,Chandler,I can’t do that.,80
S06E23 The Ring.txt,Phoebe,Well you certainly can’t give her that stupid gumball ring.,80
S06E23 The Ring.txt,Chandler,Okay and he hasn’t proposed yet because she has no ring on her finger.,82
S06E23 The Ring.txt,Phoebe,"Wow! You’re good! After this, we should solve crimes.",82
S06E23 The Ring.txt,Chandler,"Yeah! Okay, go, go, go get him.",82
S06E23 The Ring.txt,Customer,Who is it?,83
S06E23 The Ring.txt,Phoebe,It is your office.,83
S06E23 The Ring.txt,Customer,Do you know who at my office?,83
S06E23 The Ring.txt,Phoebe,John?,83
S06E23 The Ring.txt,Customer,Oh John! Great!,83
S06E23 The Ring.txt,Phoebe,Wow! I would trade.,86
S06E23 The Ring.txt,Customer,"It is beautiful, but I’m gonna use this one. Now, if you’ll excuse me.",86
S06E23 The Ring.txt,Phoebe,"Yeah, do you want to break a dying woman’s heart?",87
S06E23 The Ring.txt,Customer,You’re dying?!,87
S06E23 The Ring.txt,Chandler,"Yeah, she’s dying… Of a cough apparently.",88
S06E23 The Ring.txt,Phoebe,"Yes, and it is my dying wish to have that ring. See, if I’m not buried with that ring then my spirit is going to wander the nether world for all eternity…",88
S06E23 The Ring.txt,Ross,"Wait a minute, is this, is this for real?",96
S06E23 The Ring.txt,Joey,Oh my God!!,97
S06E23 The Ring.txt,Ross,So you two are really serious?!,97
S06E23 The Ring.txt,Chandler,"Yep, pretty much.",97
S06E23 The Ring.txt,Joey,"And-and-and-and-and-and, and we’re gonna be friends again!",98
S06E23 The Ring.txt,Joey,"Oh it’s water under the bridge, forget it!",99
S06E23 The Ring.txt,Joey,I think I’m gonna cry!,100
S06E23 The Ring.txt,Chandler,I’m gonna ask Monica to marry me.,102
S06E23 The Ring.txt,Chandler,I know.,103
S06E23 The Ring.txt,Chandler,Check out the ring.,105
S06E23 The Ring.txt,Ross,Hey-hey Pheebs!,107
S06E23 The Ring.txt,Phoebe,What?,107
S06E23 The Ring.txt,Ross,Chandler’s gonna ask Monica to marry him!,107
S06E23 The Ring.txt,Phoebe,"Oh I know, I helped pick out the ring.",107
S06E23 The Ring.txt,Ross,You told her before you told us?,108
S02E08 The List.txt,Rach,Ross kissed me.,2
S02E08 The List.txt,Mnca,"Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god!",2
S02E08 The List.txt,Rach,It was unbelievable!,2
S02E08 The List.txt,Mnca,"Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god!",2
S02E08 The List.txt,Phoe,"Ok, all right. We want to hear everything. Monica, get the wine and unplug the phone. Rachel, does this end well or do we need to get tissues?",2
S02E08 The List.txt,Rach,"Oh, it ended very well.",2
S02E08 The List.txt,Phoe,Oh.,2
S02E08 The List.txt,Phoe,"Ok, all right, let's hear about the kiss. Was it like, was it like a soft brush against your lips? Or was it like a, you know, a ""I gotta have you now"" kind of thing?",3
S02E08 The List.txt,Rach,"Well, at first it was really intense, you know. And then, oh, god, and then we just sort of sunk into it.",3
S02E08 The List.txt,Phoe,"Ok, so, ok, was he holding you? Or was his hand like on your back?",3
S02E08 The List.txt,Rach,"No, actually first they started on my waist. And then, they slid up, and then, they were in my hair.",3
S02E08 The List.txt,Ross,"And, uh, and then I kissed her.",4
S02E08 The List.txt,Joey,Tongue?,4
S02E08 The List.txt,Ross,Yeah.,4
S02E08 The List.txt,Joey,Cool.,4
S02E08 The List.txt,Chan,"All right, check out this bad boy. 12 megabytes of ram. 500 megabyte hard drive. Built-in spreadsheet capabilities and a modem that transmits at over 28,000 b.p.s.",5
S02E08 The List.txt,Phoe,Wow. What are you gonna use it for?,5
S02E08 The List.txt,Mnca,There's an ad for a naked chef?,8
S02E08 The List.txt,Ross,Hi.,10
S02E08 The List.txt,Phoe,"Hey, oh, so, um...how'd you make out last night?",10
S02E08 The List.txt,Ross,"That, that is funny. That is painfully funny. No, wait. Wait, yeah, that's just painful",10
S02E08 The List.txt,Mnca,Wait a minute. I thought last night was great.,10
S02E08 The List.txt,Ross,"Yeah, it was, but...I get home, ok, and I see Julie's saline solution on my night table. And I'm thinking to myself, oh my god, what the hell am I doing? I mean, here I am, I am with Julie, this incredible, great woman, who I care about and who cares about me, and I'm like, what, am I just gonna throw all that away?",10
S02E08 The List.txt,Joey,You got all that from saline solution?,10
S02E08 The List.txt,Mnca,We are talking about Rachel here. You and Rachel.,10
S02E08 The List.txt,Ross,How are you?,12
S02E08 The List.txt,Rach,Good. How are you?,12

S02E08 The List.txt,Rtst,Mockolate.,20
S02E08 The List.txt,Mnca,I'm sorry?,20
S02E08 The List.txt,Rtst,Mockolate. It's a completely synthetic chocolate substitute.,20
S02E08 The List.txt,Mnca,Ohh.,20
S02E08 The List.txt,Rtst,"Go ahead. Try a piece. Yeah, we think that Mockolate is even better than chocolate.",21
S02E08 The List.txt,Mnca,All right. Mmm-mmm.,21
S02E08 The List.txt,Rtst,Yeah?,22
S02E08 The List.txt,Rtst,"No, ma'am. Well, anyhoo, we should be getting our F.D.A. approval any day now, hopefully, in time for Thanksgiving. See, the way we look at it, chocolate already dominates most of your major food-preparation holidays: Easter, Christmas, what have you.",23
S02E08 The List.txt,Rtst,"But, we're thinking, given the right marketing, we can make Thanksgiving the Mockolate holiday.",24
S02E08 The List.txt,Mnca,Wow.,24
S02E08 The List.txt,Rtst,Aren't you going to swallow that?,24
S02E08 The List.txt,Mnca,Just waiting for it to stop bubbling.,24

S02E08 The List.txt,Rtst,"Well, anyhoo, um, we are looking for a couple of chefs who can create some Thanksgiving-themed recipes. You think you might be interested?",25
S02E08 The List.txt,Rtst,Really?,26
S02E08 The List.txt,Mnca,"Especially the after taste, you know, I'll tell ya, that'll last ya till Christmas.",26
S02E08 The List.txt,Mnca,How about Mockolate mousse?,27
S02E08 The List.txt,Phoe,"It's not, it's not very Thanksgiving-y.",27
S02E08 The List.txt,Mnca,"Ok, how about pilgrim Mockolate mousse?",27

S02E08 The List.txt,Mnca,"No, I'm sorry.",28
S02E08 The List.txt,Rach,"Why didn't he call? He's gonna stay with Julie, isn't he? He's gonna stay with her and she's going to be all, ""Hi, I'm Julie, Ross picked me, and we're gonna to get married, have a lot of kids and dig up stuff together.""",28
S02E08 The List.txt,Phoe,"No offense, but that sounds nothing like her.",28

S02E08 The List.txt,Chan,"Oh, I know. This must be so hard. Oh, no. Two women love me. They're both gorgeous and sexy. My wallet's too small for my fifties, and my diamond shoes are too tight.",29
S02E08 The List.txt,Chan,Don't touch the computer. Don't ever touch the computer.,30
S02E08 The List.txt,Joey,"Ross, listen. I got two words for you. Threesome.",30
S02E08 The List.txt,Chan,"Ok, all right, look. Let's get logical about this, ok? We'll make a list. Rachel and Julie, pros and cons. Oh. We'll put their names in bold, with different fonts, and I can use different colors for each column.",31

S02E08 The List.txt,Chan,"No, Amish boy.",31
S02E08 The List.txt,Joey,"Ok, let's start with the cons, 'cause they're more fun. All right, Rachel first.",31
S02E08 The List.txt,Ross,"I don't know. I mean, all right, I guess you can say she's a little spoiled sometimes.",31
S02E08 The List.txt,Joey,You could say that.,31
S02E08 The List.txt,Ross,"And I guess, you know, sometimes, she's a little ditzy, you know. And I've seen her be a little too into her looks. Oh, and Julie and I, we have a lot in common 'cause we're both paleontologists, but Rachel's just a waitress.",31
S02E08 The List.txt,Chan,Waitress. Got it. You guys wanna play Doom? Or we could keep doing this. What else?,31
S02E08 The List.txt,Ross,I don't know.,31

S02E08 The List.txt,Chan,"Ok, let's do Julie. What's wrong with her?",31
S02E08 The List.txt,Mnca,"Ok, this is pumpkin pie with mockolate cookie crumb crust. This is mockolate cranberry cake, and these are mockolate chip cookies. Just like the Indians served.",33

S02E08 The List.txt,Phoe,"Oh, oh sweet Lord! This is what evil must taste like!",35
S02E08 The List.txt,Chan,"I'm telling you this thing won't print. Yes, I pressed that button like 100 times. You know, for a hot line you are not so hot. What? What is that in the background? Are you watching Star Trek?",36
S02E08 The List.txt,Ross,"Yes, it was horrible. She cried. I cried. She threw things, they hit me. Anyway, I did the right thing.",38
S02E08 The List.txt,Ross,Hi.,41
S02E08 The List.txt,Ross,"I uh, I just got back from uh, from Julie's.",42

S02E08 The List.txt,Rach,Well what is it? Let me see.,52
S02E08 The List.txt,Ross,"Hey, someone order a coat?",53
S02E08 The List.txt,Rach,"Ross, Chandler wrote something about me on his computer and he won't let me see.",53
S02E08 The List.txt,Chan,"Yes, yes it is, short story, that I was writing.",54
S02E08 The List.txt,Rach,And I'm in it? Then let me read it.,54
S02E08 The List.txt,Rach,Come on.,54
S02E08 The List.txt,Joey,"Hey, uh, why don't you read it to her?",54
S02E08 The List.txt,Ross,That's it? That's all you wrote? You're the worst writer in the whole world.,56
S02E08 The List.txt,Rach,"All right, you know what? This isn't funny anymore. There's something about me on that piece of paper and I want to see it.",56
S02E08 The List.txt,Ross,"No, you don't.",56
S02E08 The List.txt,Rach,"What is this? Ross, what is this?",57
S02E08 The List.txt,Chan,Good luck.,57
S02E08 The List.txt,Ross,"Ok, just, just remember how crazy I am about you, ok?",58
S02E08 The List.txt,Rach,Kind of ditzy? Too into her looks? Spoiled?,58
S02E08 The List.txt,Ross,"Now that's a little spoiled. He was supposed to type ""little"", the idiot.",58
S02E08 The List.txt,Rach,Just a waitress?,58
S02E08 The List.txt,Ross,"No, that, that was, I mean, as opposed to uh, the uh, ok. Is this over yet Rach?",58
S02E08 The List.txt,Rach,Oh! I do not have chubby ankles!,58
S02E08 The List.txt,Ross,"No, no, wait, ok, ok, look at the other side. Look at Julie's column.",59
S02E08 The List.txt,Rach,She is not Rachem. What the hell's a Rachem? Is that some stupid paleontology word that I wouldn't know because I'm just a waitress.,59
S02E08 The List.txt,Ross,"No, Rach, come on. Rach! Rach, no, no! She's not Rachel, she is, she is not, Ra--Rachel?",60
S02E08 The List.txt,Chan,"My diary! My diary, that's brilliant. I should have told her it was my diary, she never would have made me read her my diary.",61
S02E08 The List.txt,Mnca,"You know, that's true. You'd be a great person to have around the day after an emergency.",61
S02E08 The List.txt,Phoe,I... I cannot believe Ross even made this list. What a dinkus.,61
S02E08 The List.txt,Joey,"Hey, cut him some slack. It was Chandler's idea.",61
S02E08 The List.txt,Phoe,What?,61
S02E08 The List.txt,Mnca,What?,61
S02E08 The List.txt,Chan,"Oh good, I was hoping that would come up.",61
S02E08 The List.txt,Mnca,This was your idea?,61
S02E08 The List.txt,Phoe,What were you thinking?,61
S02E08 The List.txt,Mnca,Yeah. You!,62
S02E08 The List.txt,Chan,"All right, Pheebs, back me up here, ok? You believe in that karma crap, don't you?",62

S02E08 The List.txt,Ross,"Rach, come on, look, I know how you must feel.",71
S02E08 The List.txt,Ross,"No, but, but I wanna be with you in spite of all those things.",72
S02E08 The List.txt,Ross,"You know what? You know what? If, things were the other way around, there's nothing you could put on a list that would ever make me not want to be with you.",73
S02E08 The List.txt,Rach,"Well, then, I guess that's the difference between us. See, I'd never make a list.",73
S02E08 The List.txt,Mnca,"Now, in some of these recipes, the quantities may seem just a little unusual, uh, like these coconut mockolate holiday nut bars. I've indicated four cups of coconut, and four cups of crushed nut, and only, uh, one tablespoon of mockolate.",76
S02E08 The List.txt,Rtst,Doesn't matter.,76
S02E08 The List.txt,Mnca,What?,76
S02E08 The List.txt,Rtst,Our FDA approval didn't come through. Something about laboratory rats.,76

S02E08 The List.txt,Rtst,"Oh, some, that's fine. Some is fine. Some is not a lot. So, it doesn't burn when you pee, does it?",77
S02E08 The List.txt,Mnca,Hello?,79
S02E08 The List.txt,Ross,Hi.,80
S02E08 The List.txt,Ross,"Look, can, can you do something for me?",82
S02E08 The List.txt,Radio,"Uh, we've just gotten a call from Rachel, and she told us what Ross did. It's pretty appalling, and Ross, if you're listening, I don't wanna play your song anymore. Why don't we devote our time to a couple that stands a chance? Avery, Michelle's sorry she hit you with her car and she hopes you two will work it out.",86
S02E08 The List.txt,Rtst,"Hi, thanks for coming in again.",87
S02E08 The List.txt,Mnca,"Oh, not at all. I have no morals and I need the cash.",87
S02E08 The List.txt,Rtst,"It's like I'm lookin' in a mirror. Anyway, they're called ""fishtachios"". They taste exactly like pistachios, but they're made primarily of reconstituted fish bits. Here, try one. You're not allergic to anything, are you?",87

S06E03 Rosss Denial.txt,Chandler,"Pheebs, I don’t understand. How can you have a roommate that none of us know anything about?",6
S06E03 Rosss Denial.txt,Phoebe,Maybe because you never listen to anything that I say. I talk about her all the time! DENISE!!!!!,6
S06E03 Rosss Denial.txt,Joey,"Hey Rach, listen I was thinkin’ uh, I’m gonna have an extra room over at my place…",6
S06E03 Rosss Denial.txt,Rachel,"Oh, that’s true.",6
S06E03 Rosss Denial.txt,Joey,"Yeah, why don’t you move in with me? It’ll be great! We could stay up late, watch movies, and you know about Naked Thursday’s right?",6

S06E03 Rosss Denial.txt,Phoebe,Hey.,7
S06E03 Rosss Denial.txt,Ross,Hey!,7
S06E03 Rosss Denial.txt,Phoebe,"So, what did Rachel say when you told her you were still married to her?",7
S06E03 Rosss Denial.txt,Ross,"Oh, that. Umm, she took it really well.",7
S06E03 Rosss Denial.txt,Phoebe,You didn’t tell her did you?,7
S06E03 Rosss Denial.txt,Ross,No.,7
S06E03 Rosss Denial.txt,Phoebe,"Of course not, because you’re in love with her.",7
S06E03 Rosss Denial.txt,Ross,"I am not in love with her. She was very upset about having to move out so I eh, didn’t tell her we were still married because she would only get more upset. I-I just comforted her, as a friend.",7
S06E03 Rosss Denial.txt,Phoebe,"What do you mean, comforted her?",7
S06E03 Rosss Denial.txt,Ross,"It’s nothing, I just gave her a hug.",7
S06E03 Rosss Denial.txt,Phoebe,"Ah-ha! A classic sign of love, the hug!",7
S06E03 Rosss Denial.txt,Ross,It’s also a sign of friendship.,7
S06E03 Rosss Denial.txt,Phoebe,"Okay, just tell me this, did you or did you not smell her hair?",9
S06E03 Rosss Denial.txt,Ross,S-s-smell her hair? What if I did?,9
S06E03 Rosss Denial.txt,Phoebe,"Okay, I didn’t understand that, but y’know, maybe that’s ‘cause you were speaking the secret language of love!",13
S06E03 Rosss Denial.txt,Chandler,Who was it?,16
S06E03 Rosss Denial.txt,Monica,"Okay listen, y’know when you move in Rachel’s room is gonna be empty, you wanna talk about what we want to do with it?",17
S06E03 Rosss Denial.txt,Chandler,Sure!,17
S06E03 Rosss Denial.txt,Monica,"Okay, I was thinking we should have a beautiful guest room, right? With a mahogany sleigh bed and bedside tables with flowers on them all the time! And we could have a roll top desk with comment cards on them so people could say how much they loved staying here!! Okay, whatever, I really haven’t thought about it that much.",17
S06E03 Rosss Denial.txt,Chandler,"Well, I like that idea. Obviously! I was thinking maybe-maybe-maybe it could be a game room, y’know? I mean you can buy old arcade games like uh, like Space Invaders and Asteroids for $200, the real ones! The big-big ones!",17
S06E03 Rosss Denial.txt,Monica,No.,17
S06E03 Rosss Denial.txt,Chandler,"Okay so you mean no as in, ""Gee Chandler, what an interesting idea. Let’s discuss it before we reject it completely.""",17
S06E03 Rosss Denial.txt,Monica,"Oh, I’m sorry. Of course I mean that. Interesting idea, umm, talk about it, but no.",17
S06E03 Rosss Denial.txt,Chandler,"So, that’s it?",17
S06E03 Rosss Denial.txt,Monica,I just don’t think arcade games go in the beautiful guest room. The beautiful guest room is gonna be filled with antiques.,17
S06E03 Rosss Denial.txt,Chandler,Which is why Asteroids is perfect! It’s the oldest game!,17
S06E03 Rosss Denial.txt,Monica,What do you have against the beautiful guest room?,17
S06E03 Rosss Denial.txt,Chandler,"I don’t have anything against the beautiful guest room, especially since everybody we know lives about 30 seconds away!",17
S06E03 Rosss Denial.txt,Monica,Are you mocking me?,17
S06E03 Rosss Denial.txt,Joey,"Hey, what’s up?",19
S06E03 Rosss Denial.txt,Chandler,"Nothing, Monica and I had a stupid fight.",19
S06E03 Rosss Denial.txt,Rachel,"Pheebs, I have to ask you…",23
S06E03 Rosss Denial.txt,Phoebe,Shhhhhh! I’m swamped right now.,23
S06E03 Rosss Denial.txt,Rachel,You’re just staring into space.,23
S06E03 Rosss Denial.txt,Phoebe,It worked!,25

S06E03 Rosss Denial.txt,Ross,"Rach, uh, you still looking for a place?",28
S06E03 Rosss Denial.txt,Rachel,Yeah! Why?,28
S06E03 Rosss Denial.txt,Ross,"Okay, there’s this guy, Warren, from the museum and he’s going on a dig for like two years and he’s got this great place he needs to sublet. So uh, you interested?",28
S06E03 Rosss Denial.txt,Rachel,That sounds great! I’d love to live at Warren’s!! I love Warren! Thank you!,28
S06E03 Rosss Denial.txt,Ross,"Okay, you go grab it!",31
S06E03 Rosss Denial.txt,Phoebe,I saw it.,31
S06E03 Rosss Denial.txt,Ross,I don’t know what you’re talking about.,31
S06E03 Rosss Denial.txt,Phoebe,"Umm, I’m talking about that which you already know but won’t admit. You love her again; you re-love her!",31
S06E03 Rosss Denial.txt,Ross,"Look, I do not re-love her.",31
S06E03 Rosss Denial.txt,Ross,"Look, we’re just friends now! Okay? Why would I do anything stupid?",32
S06E03 Rosss Denial.txt,Ross,You can live with me.,33
S06E03 Rosss Denial.txt,Rachel,What?!,33
S06E03 Rosss Denial.txt,Phoebe,What?!,33
S06E03 Rosss Denial.txt,Ross,What?,33
S06E03 Rosss Denial.txt,Rachel,Oh my God! Are you serious?!,34
S06E03 Rosss Denial.txt,Rachel,I would love to live with you Ross; that’s-that’s great! Thank you!,35
S06E03 Rosss Denial.txt,Ross,"Well, I’m-I’m just glad I could, y’know, help you out.",35
S06E03 Rosss Denial.txt,Rachel,"Ross-Ross, you have no idea what this means to me! I mean, I mean I was gonna be homeless. You just saved me! You’re my hero!",36
S06E03 Rosss Denial.txt,Ross,"Hero, I uh, I don’t know—well, all right.",36
S06E03 Rosss Denial.txt,Chandler,Hi.,40
S06E03 Rosss Denial.txt,Monica,Hi.,40
S06E03 Rosss Denial.txt,Chandler,Really?,42
S06E03 Rosss Denial.txt,Monica,Yeah! Oh yes!,42
S06E03 Rosss Denial.txt,Chandler,Ohh.,42
S06E03 Rosss Denial.txt,Monica,"Listen, we don’t have to make that a guest room, we can think of something to do with the room together.",42
S06E03 Rosss Denial.txt,Chandler,That’s a great idea! We can easily think of a way for us both to enjoy the room.,42
S06E03 Rosss Denial.txt,Monica,Totally!,42
S06E03 Rosss Denial.txt,Chandler,We don’t have to come up with this now.,43
S06E03 Rosss Denial.txt,Monica,Oh good.,43
S06E03 Rosss Denial.txt,Chandler,"Hey, y’know what? Why don’t we think about changes we can make in the living room?",43
S06E03 Rosss Denial.txt,Monica,Changes?,43
S06E03 Rosss Denial.txt,Monica,You’re-you’re-you’re gonna bring the Barca Lounger over here?,44
S06E03 Rosss Denial.txt,Chandler,Is that a problem?,44
S06E03 Rosss Denial.txt,Monica,"Well, it’s a set and they should probably stay together.",44
S06E03 Rosss Denial.txt,Chandler,"Oh, that’s cool. Then I’ll just bring them both over.",44
S06E03 Rosss Denial.txt,Monica,See now-now you’re taking them away from their home.,44
S06E03 Rosss Denial.txt,Chandler,"Okay, I get it. So, I get nothing! Nothing here is mine! Everything here is yours! I’ll get up in the morning put on your clothes, and head off to work!",44
S06E03 Rosss Denial.txt,Monica,"Yeah-yeah, y’know what? Yeah, that’s it-that’s it, everything will be mine! Nothing will be yours! That’s-that’s what I said! Oh come on, Chandler! I’m talking about the barca lounger! It just, it doesn’t match! Where is it gonna go?!",44
S06E03 Rosss Denial.txt,Chandler,In the game room!,44
S06E03 Rosss Denial.txt,Monica,Look it is not my fault that your chairs are incredibly ugly!,44
S06E03 Rosss Denial.txt,Joey,"Whoa!! Now look, don’t be just blurtin’ stuff out. I want you to really think about your answers. Okay?",47
S06E03 Rosss Denial.txt,Joey,"Oh don’t listen to him, he’s just some guy who really wants the apartment, but I don’t think he’s gonna get it.",48
S06E03 Rosss Denial.txt,Chandler,Why did you take the shower curtain down?,48
S06E03 Rosss Denial.txt,Rachel,Hey!,50
S06E03 Rosss Denial.txt,Ross,"Hey! Oh listen, I was just clearing some space for your stuff.",50
S06E03 Rosss Denial.txt,Rachel,"Oh thanks, but listen, I was just at Monica’s and she and Chandler had a big fight and they’re not moving in.",50
S06E03 Rosss Denial.txt,Ross,"What do you mean, they’re not moving in? They-they’re still moving in right?",50
S06E03 Rosss Denial.txt,Rachel,"No-no, they just had a big blowout over what to do with my room.",50
S06E03 Rosss Denial.txt,Ross,What?! Over a stupid room!,50
S06E03 Rosss Denial.txt,Rachel,"Yeah, I feel kinda bad for them, but I’m also really psyched ‘cause I don’t have to move in here!",50
S06E03 Rosss Denial.txt,Ross,"Oh no, yeah no, that part’s great!",50
S06E03 Rosss Denial.txt,Ross,"What’s all this about you guys fighting?! Is this really over a room?! I mean, that is so silly!",51
S06E03 Rosss Denial.txt,Monica,"Ross, we can handle this.",51
S06E03 Rosss Denial.txt,Ross,"Well, apparently not, and I can’t just stand by and watch two people I care about very much be hurt over something that is so silly. I mean, enough of the silliness!",51
S06E03 Rosss Denial.txt,Chandler,"Well, we are fond of the silliness, but we also have a soft spot for the love.",53
S06E03 Rosss Denial.txt,Monica,Love is the best medicine.,53
S06E03 Rosss Denial.txt,Chandler,That’s laughter.,53
S06E03 Rosss Denial.txt,Monica,Why do you do it?,53
S06E03 Rosss Denial.txt,Chandler,I don’t know.,53
S06E03 Rosss Denial.txt,Ross,"Okay! All right! Now, Chandler you-you wanna live with Monica, right?",53

S06E03 Rosss Denial.txt,Gunther,"Oh, I was going to offer you my apartment.",55
S06E03 Rosss Denial.txt,Rachel,"Why, where are you going?",55
S06E03 Rosss Denial.txt,Gunther,I don’t know.,55
S06E03 Rosss Denial.txt,Rachel,Hi!,56
S06E03 Rosss Denial.txt,Ross,"You’re never gonna believe it uh, Monica and Chandler are moving in again. That’s great news right—I mean for them. Right?",56
S06E03 Rosss Denial.txt,Rachel,Oh wow.,56
S06E03 Rosss Denial.txt,Ross,"Yeah but, on the bright side, we get to be roommates again.",56
S06E03 Rosss Denial.txt,Rachel,"Yeah. Y’know umm, uh, umm, about that, umm, Ross I really appreciate your offer to let me move in and everything, but don’t you think it’s gonna be weird?",56
S06E03 Rosss Denial.txt,Ross,"Wh-why?! Why-why-why would it, why would it be weird?",56
S06E03 Rosss Denial.txt,Rachel,"Well, because of us! Because of our history.",56
S06E03 Rosss Denial.txt,Ross,No!,56
S06E03 Rosss Denial.txt,Rachel,No?,56
S06E03 Rosss Denial.txt,Ross,"No! No! It would be weird if we were still in that place, I mean are you still in that place?",56
S06E03 Rosss Denial.txt,Rachel,No! Not at all!,56
S06E03 Rosss Denial.txt,Ross,Good! Me neither! So it’s not a problem. We’re just two friends who happen to be roommates.,56
S06E03 Rosss Denial.txt,Rachel,"Okay, but Ross, eventually you and I are gonna be dating.",56
S06E03 Rosss Denial.txt,Ross,Really?! We are?,56
S06E03 Rosss Denial.txt,Rachel,"Yeah! I’m gonna have a boyfriend, you’re gonna have a girlfriend…",56
S06E03 Rosss Denial.txt,Ross,Ohh! That would be great.,56
S06E03 Rosss Denial.txt,Ross,So are you sure about this whole moving in thing?! I mean it’s a really big step! And-and what’s the rush?!,59
S06E03 Rosss Denial.txt,Monica,That’s very funny!,60
S06E03 Rosss Denial.txt,Chandler,"He’s being silly, because he knows that we enjoy the silliness!",60
S06E03 Rosss Denial.txt,Ross,"No, I-I-I’m serious, okay? I mean, think about it. You move in, you start fighting over stupid game rooms, next thing y’know you break up!",60
S06E03 Rosss Denial.txt,Monica,"Ross, you were right before, it was just a stupid fight about a room.",60
S06E03 Rosss Denial.txt,Chandler,"Yeah, I'm not so worried.",61
S06E03 Rosss Denial.txt,Monica,"Yeah, no, me neither.",61
S06E03 Rosss Denial.txt,Monica,You still want to move in together right?,62
S06E03 Rosss Denial.txt,Chandler,Of course!,62
S06E03 Rosss Denial.txt,Monica,Ross didn’t scare you?,62
S06E03 Rosss Denial.txt,Chandler,Scared me out of ever wanting to live with him.,62
S06E03 Rosss Denial.txt,Monica,"Come here, I want to show you something!",62
S06E03 Rosss Denial.txt,Chandler,Okay!,62
S06E03 Rosss Denial.txt,Chandler,Oh my God! Someone’s killed Square Man!,63
S06E03 Rosss Denial.txt,Monica,This is where I thought the barca lounger could go! You see you could see the TV and it’s still walking distance to the kitchen.,63
S06E03 Rosss Denial.txt,Chandler,Oh that’s so sweet! I want to show you something too!,63
S06E03 Rosss Denial.txt,Monica,Okay!,63
S06E03 Rosss Denial.txt,Chandler,"Y’know those big-big uh, road signs that say ""Merge?""",63
S06E03 Rosss Denial.txt,Monica,Uh-hmm.,63
S06E03 Rosss Denial.txt,Chandler,"Y’know? So I was thinking that we could get one of those signs and hang it over our bed. Because, that’s you and I together! Merge!",63
S06E03 Rosss Denial.txt,Monica,Oh my God! I love that!,63
S06E03 Rosss Denial.txt,Chandler,Really?!,63

S06E03 Rosss Denial.txt,Ross,Fighting?!,67
S06E03 Rosss Denial.txt,Rachel,"No, the other thing. I really think it’s great they work things out.",67
S06E03 Rosss Denial.txt,Ross,"Yeah. There’s no breaking them up, is there?",67
S06E03 Rosss Denial.txt,Rachel,"Hey, can I borrow the key to your house so I can run across the street and make a copy?",67
S06E03 Rosss Denial.txt,Joey,"Umm, listen, Ross do you really think this moving in with Rachel is a good idea?",70
S06E03 Rosss Denial.txt,Ross,I’ve been back and forth.,70
S06E03 Rosss Denial.txt,Joey,"Yeah well, maybe you should go back! Okay? Rachel moves in, and before you know it you’re right where you don’t want to be! Back together!",70
S06E03 Rosss Denial.txt,Ross,"Ehh, I don’t, I don’t think so. She’s already talked about y’know, dating other guys.",70
S06E03 Rosss Denial.txt,Joey,"That’s not gonna work out! Then she’s gonna come home all weepy and you’ll be tellin’ her, ""Oh that’s okay. You’ll find someone."" And then, bamn! She finds you!",70
S06E03 Rosss Denial.txt,Ross,"Yeah, well, m-maybe you’re right.",70

S06E03 Rosss Denial.txt,Rachel,"All right, well the place was closed. I’ll just copy it later.",72
S06E03 Rosss Denial.txt,Ross,"Whoa! Whoa! Whoa, Joey!",73
S06E03 Rosss Denial.txt,Joey,"No-no-no-no-no-no-no-no… It’s okay, I mean I—look Rach, I know I scared you off with that whole Naked Thursday’s thing, but we don’t have to do that!",73
S06E03 Rosss Denial.txt,Rachel,"Well, it would be easier to move just right across the hall. Wait a minute, unless you’re thinking about Naked Wednesday’s.",73
S06E03 Rosss Denial.txt,Joey,"Thursday’s clearly not good for ya, pick a day!",73
S06E03 Rosss Denial.txt,Joey,"Come in. Thanks for comin’ back, umm, okay there have been a lot of people interested in the room, but I have narrowed it down and you are one of the finalists!",75
S06E03 Rosss Denial.txt,Joey,"Okay now, before I make my final decision I uh, I just want to make sure our personalities match. Okay, so I made up a little test. Now, I’m gonna say a word and then you say the first thing that comes to mind.",75

S04E04 The Ballroom Dancing.txt,Monica,God! If you’re gonna cry about it! (She grabs the box and goes to through it out.],9
S04E04 The Ballroom Dancing.txt,Joey,"Whoa-whoa, Treeger made you cry?",10
S04E04 The Ballroom Dancing.txt,Rachel,Yes! And he said really mean things that were only partly true.,10
S04E04 The Ballroom Dancing.txt,Joey,I’m gonna go down there and teach that guy a lesson.,10
S04E04 The Ballroom Dancing.txt,Monica,"Joey, please don’t do that. I think it’s best that we just forget about it.",10
S04E04 The Ballroom Dancing.txt,Rachel,"That’s easy for you to say, you weren’t almost just killed.",10
S04E04 The Ballroom Dancing.txt,Chandler,"Oh yeah, gym member. I try to go four times a week, but I’ve missed the last 1200 times.",12
S04E04 The Ballroom Dancing.txt,Ross,So why don’t you quit?,12
S04E04 The Ballroom Dancing.txt,Chandler,"You don’t think I’ve tried? You think I like having 50 dollars taken out of my bank account every month? No, they make you go all the way down there! Then they use all of these phrases and peppiness to try and confuse you! Then they bring out Maria.",12
S04E04 The Ballroom Dancing.txt,Ross,Who is Maria?,12
S04E04 The Ballroom Dancing.txt,Chandler,"Oh Maria. You can’t say no to her, she’s like this lycra spandex covered gym…treat.",12
S04E04 The Ballroom Dancing.txt,Ross,You need me to go down there with you and hold your hand?,12
S04E04 The Ballroom Dancing.txt,Chandler,No!,12

S07E03 Phoebes Cookies.txt,Chandler,An old cookie?,15
S07E03 Phoebes Cookies.txt,Phoebe,"See no-no, I made a batch and I froze it, and this is the only one left.",16
S07E03 Phoebes Cookies.txt,Chandler,We can’t accept this.,16
S07E03 Phoebes Cookies.txt,Phoebe,Why not?,16
S07E03 Phoebes Cookies.txt,Chandler,‘Cause it’s gross.,16

S07E03 Phoebes Cookies.txt,Joey,"Uh, boat rope.",22
S07E03 Phoebes Cookies.txt,Rachel,Wrong! How do you get the mainsail up?,22
S07E03 Phoebes Cookies.txt,Joey,"Uhh, rub it?",22
S07E03 Phoebes Cookies.txt,Rachel,No. What do you do if I say we are coming about?,22
S07E03 Phoebes Cookies.txt,Joey,"I’d say, come again. No-no, wait I-I-I know this one, I know this one, uh…",22
S07E03 Phoebes Cookies.txt,Rachel,"Time’s up, now your dead.",23
S07E03 Phoebes Cookies.txt,Joey,And deaf!,23
S07E03 Phoebes Cookies.txt,Joey,Yes.,24
S07E03 Phoebes Cookies.txt,Rachel,"Don’t just say yes! This isn’t a game, Joey you can really get hurt out here. Okay, so do you want to pay attention or do you want to die?!",24
S07E03 Phoebes Cookies.txt,Joey,I want to make a ship to shore call to Chandler.,24
S07E03 Phoebes Cookies.txt,Monica,"All right, I definitely taste nutmeg.",25

S07E03 Phoebes Cookies.txt,Chandler,I will tell the story! It was going great. I let him win. We were bonding. He even said I could call him dad.,31
S07E03 Phoebes Cookies.txt,Ross,And what did he ask you not to call him?,31
S07E03 Phoebes Cookies.txt,Chandler,Guys?,33
S07E03 Phoebes Cookies.txt,Monica,Oh my God Chandler! I can’t believe it!,36
S07E03 Phoebes Cookies.txt,Chandler,I know.,36
S07E03 Phoebes Cookies.txt,Monica,You gave my father a lap dance!,36
S07E03 Phoebes Cookies.txt,Chandler,Why do they put so much steam in there?!,36
S07E03 Phoebes Cookies.txt,Ross,‘Cause otherwise they’d have to call it the room room.,36
S07E03 Phoebes Cookies.txt,Chandler,Why? Okay? Why? Wh-wh-why did that have to happen?,36
S07E03 Phoebes Cookies.txt,Phoebe,"Come on, it’s not that big a deal!",36
S07E03 Phoebes Cookies.txt,Chandler,Not that big a deal? There…there was touching of things.,36
S07E03 Phoebes Cookies.txt,Ross,"Now, I know you wanted to bond with my dad, but did you really have to bond to that part?",36
S07E03 Phoebes Cookies.txt,Monica,"Listen, I’m sure that dad doesn’t care. He probably thought this was funny; he’ll be telling this story for years!",36
S07E03 Phoebes Cookies.txt,Chandler,I don’t want him to tell this story for years.,36
S07E03 Phoebes Cookies.txt,Ross,"Oh, but he will. He still tells the story how Monica tried to escape from fat camp.",36
S07E03 Phoebes Cookies.txt,Monica,I wasn’t escaping.,36
S07E03 Phoebes Cookies.txt,Ross,Then how did you get caught in the barbed wire?,36
S07E03 Phoebes Cookies.txt,Monica,I was trying to help out a squirrel.,36
S07E03 Phoebes Cookies.txt,Ross,You were trying to eat it!,36
S07E03 Phoebes Cookies.txt,Chandler,If that is your father calling to tell this story then the marriage is off!,37
S07E03 Phoebes Cookies.txt,Ross,"Whoa-whoa, aren’t you a little over dressed?",40
S07E03 Phoebes Cookies.txt,Rachel,"I don’t know. Y’know, they didn’t get us anything.",43
S07E03 Phoebes Cookies.txt,Ross,Thank you!,43
S07E03 Phoebes Cookies.txt,Ross,Hey.,44
S07E03 Phoebes Cookies.txt,Rachel,"Well hello! So, when are we gettin’ back out on the water matey?",44
S07E03 Phoebes Cookies.txt,Joey,"Oh uh, I don’t know the boat way to say this, but uh never!",44
S07E03 Phoebes Cookies.txt,Rachel,Why not?,44
S07E03 Phoebes Cookies.txt,Joey,Because! You’re mean on the boat!,44
S07E03 Phoebes Cookies.txt,Rachel,What? I was just trying to teach you.,44
S07E03 Phoebes Cookies.txt,Joey,"Well, lesson learned! Rachel is mean!",44
S07E03 Phoebes Cookies.txt,Ross,Yeeeeeep… Yep-yep-yep-yep-yep. I remember when she took out on her dad’s boat she wouldn’t let me help at all.,44
S07E03 Phoebes Cookies.txt,Rachel,"Excuse me, I wanted you to help, but you couldn’t move your arms because you were wearing three life jackets.",44
S07E03 Phoebes Cookies.txt,Rachel,"Look Joey, I’m sorry if-if you thought that was mean, but I gotta tell ya something. That was not mean. Okay, my father is mean. He used to yell at me all the time on the boat, I mean it was horrible. I was just being a good teacher.",45
S07E03 Phoebes Cookies.txt,Joey,"Does a good teacher say, ""Put down the beer pinhead!?""",45
S07E03 Phoebes Cookies.txt,Rachel,"Well, does a good student drink seven beers during his first lesson?",45
S07E03 Phoebes Cookies.txt,Joey,Six and a half! You knocked that last one out of my hand! Remember?,45
S07E03 Phoebes Cookies.txt,Rachel,"Yeah, I didn’t want you to get hit by the boom!",45
S07E03 Phoebes Cookies.txt,Joey,Well it hit me anyway! And it would’ve hurt a lot less if I had finished that last beer.,45
S07E03 Phoebes Cookies.txt,Rachel,"All right, y’know what? I-I’m sorry. I will try to tone it down and uh stop yelling.",45
S07E03 Phoebes Cookies.txt,Joey,You won’t boss me around anymore?,45
S07E03 Phoebes Cookies.txt,Rachel,I won’t boss you around.,45
S07E03 Phoebes Cookies.txt,Joey,And you’ll be nice?,45
S07E03 Phoebes Cookies.txt,Rachel,"And, I’ll be nice.",45
S07E03 Phoebes Cookies.txt,Joey,And you’ll be topless?,45
S07E03 Phoebes Cookies.txt,Rachel,And—Joey!,45
S07E03 Phoebes Cookies.txt,Joey,Do you want me to learn?!,45
S07E03 Phoebes Cookies.txt,Monica,"Okay, here’s batch 22. Ohh, maybe these’ll taste a little like your grandmother’s. This has a little bit of orange peel, but no nutmeg.",46
S07E03 Phoebes Cookies.txt,Ross,Let’s give it a shot.,46
S07E03 Phoebes Cookies.txt,Monica,"Okay. Man, I have not made this many cookies since I was in the ninth grade.",46
S07E03 Phoebes Cookies.txt,Phoebe,"Oh, what was that for? Like a bake sale?",46
S07E03 Phoebes Cookies.txt,Monica,"No, just a Friday night.",46
S07E03 Phoebes Cookies.txt,Ross,"Ohh, these are pretty good.",47
S07E03 Phoebes Cookies.txt,Phoebe,"Yeah, but not as good as batch 17.",47
S07E03 Phoebes Cookies.txt,Ross,Which one was that?,47
S07E03 Phoebes Cookies.txt,Monica,The ones we had right after you almost threw up.,47
S07E03 Phoebes Cookies.txt,Phoebe,Are there anymore from the good batch? ‘Cause we could just work off of those.,48
S07E03 Phoebes Cookies.txt,Joey,Ohh yeah.,51
S07E03 Phoebes Cookies.txt,Rachel,Right?,51
S07E03 Phoebes Cookies.txt,Joey,Nope.,51
S07E03 Phoebes Cookies.txt,Rachel,"It’s left sweetie, but that’s okay sweetie, that’s a tough one.",51
S07E03 Phoebes Cookies.txt,Joey,I don’t know why you just don’t say left.,51
S07E03 Phoebes Cookies.txt,Joey,Huh?,52
S07E03 Phoebes Cookies.txt,Rachel,"No! No-no, no-no-no, very quiet, said with love, no yelling.",54
S07E03 Phoebes Cookies.txt,Joey,"Uh, wow, you just said a bunch of stuff I didn’t know there.",56
S07E03 Phoebes Cookies.txt,Joey,"Oh, y’know, when we did that was when that bird was flying overhead with the fish in his mouth. Did you see it? It was gross!",57
S07E03 Phoebes Cookies.txt,Joey,All right that’s it! You’re yelling and I don’t see you taking your top off! I quit!,58
S07E03 Phoebes Cookies.txt,Rachel,What do you mean you quit?! You can’t quit!,58
S07E03 Phoebes Cookies.txt,Joey,Why not?!,58
S07E03 Phoebes Cookies.txt,Rachel,Because you’re not finished yet and I won’t have it! Greens do not quit!,58
S07E03 Phoebes Cookies.txt,Joey,Greens? I’m a Tribbiani! And Tribbianis quit!,58
S07E03 Phoebes Cookies.txt,Joey,Yes! Yes! You did and you’re still yelling at me!,59
S07E03 Phoebes Cookies.txt,Rachel,"No! No! No! I’m not yelling at you, I’m just yelling near you. Oh God Joey, ohh I’m my father. Oh my God, this is horrible! I’ve been trying so hard not to be my mother I did not see this comin’. Oh, Joey, I’m sorry. I’m so sorry. I just wanted you to learn.",59
S07E03 Phoebes Cookies.txt,Joey,"Well, hey I did learn.",59
S07E03 Phoebes Cookies.txt,Rachel,Really?,59
S07E03 Phoebes Cookies.txt,Joey,Yeah! Come on.,59

S07E03 Phoebes Cookies.txt,Joey,Damnit!,60
S07E03 Phoebes Cookies.txt,Phoebe,"Y’know, I bet it would actually make my grandmother very happy to know that we’re trying to figure out her recipe. I bet she’s l-l-lookin’ up at us and smiling right now.",61
S07E03 Phoebes Cookies.txt,Ross,Looking up?,61
S07E03 Phoebes Cookies.txt,Phoebe,"Oh yeah—No, she was really nice to me, but she’s in hell for sure.",61
S07E03 Phoebes Cookies.txt,Monica,"Well, I’ve tried everything. I give up. I guess I’m not gonna be the mom who makes the world’s best chocolate cookies. I do make the best duck confit with broccoli rabe.  Kids love that right.",61
S07E03 Phoebes Cookies.txt,Ross,"Aww, Pheeb, come on isn’t there any relative that would have the recipe? What about, what about your sister?",61
S07E03 Phoebes Cookies.txt,Phoebe,"Oh no-no, no, I made a promise to myself that the next time I would talk to Ursula would be over my dead body. And that’s not happening ‘til October 15th, 2032.",61
S07E03 Phoebes Cookies.txt,Ross,"That’s the day you’re gonna die? See—darnit, I’ve got shuffleboard that day.",61
S07E03 Phoebes Cookies.txt,Phoebe,That’s what you think.,61
S07E03 Phoebes Cookies.txt,Monica,"Well, I mean what about friends of your grandmother’s? Wouldn’t they have the recipe?",61
S07E03 Phoebes Cookies.txt,Phoebe,"Well, y’know I may have relatives in France who would know. My grandmother said she got the recipe from her grandmother, Nesele Tolouse.",61
S07E03 Phoebes Cookies.txt,Monica,What was her name?,61
S07E03 Phoebes Cookies.txt,Phoebe,Nesele Toulouse.,61

S07E03 Phoebes Cookies.txt,Phoebe,"Oh, you Americans always butcher the French language.",61
S07E03 Phoebes Cookies.txt,Monica,I cannot believe that I just spent the last two days trying to figure out the recipe and it was in my cupboard the whole time!,63
S07E03 Phoebes Cookies.txt,Chandler,"So you understand, I’d feel a lot more comfortable if you didn’t tell people what happened. Y’know, I’m a little…I’m a little embarrassed about it.",65
S07E03 Phoebes Cookies.txt,Chandler,What did you do when they found out?,65
S07E03 Phoebes Cookies.txt,Chandler,So I guess we wear swimsuits in here!,66
S07E03 Phoebes Cookies.txt,Rachel,"Well Joey, I hate to admit it, your way of sailing is a lot more fun.",67
S07E03 Phoebes Cookies.txt,Rachel,Ohh we’re not sailing.,68

S10E06 Rosss Grant.txt,Phoebe,"Oh, my first love!",8

S10E06 Rosss Grant.txt,Chandler,"First of all. Bravo. Uh, but I really don't think you're right for this. The part calls for a stuffy college professor.",15

S10E06 Rosss Grant.txt,Charlie,"Wow, that's great! So, tell me about the grant!",19
S10E06 Rosss Grant.txt,Ross,"Well, ok, it's for 25 thousand dollars. And if I get it, I'll finally be able to complete my field research! And there will be an article about me in the ""Paleontology Review""! Yeah! That'll be the first time my name is in there, without people raising serious questions about my work!",19
S10E06 Rosss Grant.txt,Charlie,Wait. Are you talking about the Dewar grant?,19
S10E06 Rosss Grant.txt,Ross,Yeah. Why?,19

S10E06 Rosss Grant.txt,Charlie,"No, no, we ended up in great terms. I mean, if anything, I think this could help you. You know what? Why don't we all go out to dinner together, and I can introduce you.",19
S10E06 Rosss Grant.txt,Ross,"Well, if you think it would help.",19
S10E06 Rosss Grant.txt,Charlie,"Yes, absolutely. I'll call him.",19

S10E06 Rosss Grant.txt,Monica,"Oh, well. Now that I'm here I might as well help you with the cleaning and organizing! Just happen to have my label maker!",21
S10E06 Rosss Grant.txt,Phoebe,"Oh, it's so hard to get rid of stuff! Did you and Chandler have to make compromises when you first moved in together?",21
S10E06 Rosss Grant.txt,Monica,"Uh, Chandler did! What does he want you to give up?",21
S10E06 Rosss Grant.txt,Phoebe,A bunch of stuff. And the worst one... he wants me to get rid of Gladys.,21

S10E06 Rosss Grant.txt,Phoebe,"Why, you don't like her?",23
S10E06 Rosss Grant.txt,Monica,"Well, of course I do. What's not to like! I'll take her in a minute! But, you know, I think that you're giving up too easy, honey. I think that you need to fight for her!",23
S10E06 Rosss Grant.txt,Phoebe,Really? You think?,23
S10E06 Rosss Grant.txt,Monica,"Absolutely! Yes, you say to him ""I'm sorry Mike I can't live without her, she means too much to me!""",23
S10E06 Rosss Grant.txt,Phoebe,"Ok, I'll fight for her. Ok! Oh, wait, oh I just realized... if I do that, that means you don't get her.",23

S10E06 Rosss Grant.txt,Joey,Just pass it to your boss!,28
S10E06 Rosss Grant.txt,Chandler,"He's not right for the part. So if I suggest him, my bosses are gonna think I'm an idiot! And that's something they should learn on their own!",28
S10E06 Rosss Grant.txt,Rachel,"Just tell Joey that you watched the tape and you liked it, but your bosses didn't. Then that way, you're the good guy and they're the bad guys.",28
S10E06 Rosss Grant.txt,Ross,I can't believe I'm about to meet Benjamin Hobart. I've always thought of him as one of the people I'd invite to my fantasy dinner party. Do you think there's any chance he'll bring Christie Brinkley or C3PO?,30

S10E06 Rosss Grant.txt,Charlie,"Ross, why don't you tell Benji about your proposal, while I go to the ladies room?",39
S10E06 Rosss Grant.txt,Benjamin,"So, tell me about it.",39
S10E06 Rosss Grant.txt,Ross,"Ok well, I would like to do a dig in the painted desert.",39

S10E06 Rosss Grant.txt,Ross,"Kind of inappropriate, don't you think?",39
S10E06 Rosss Grant.txt,Benjamin,"I'm sorry. I just haven't seen her for so long! All these feelings are rushing back! I'm starting to realize how much I missed her, and I'm gonna need you to break up with her.",39

S10E06 Rosss Grant.txt,Rachel,Who's Gladys?,40

S10E06 Rosss Grant.txt,Chandler,Bad news. I watched the tape and passed it along to my bosses and they weren't interested.,44
S10E06 Rosss Grant.txt,Joey,"Look, it's one thing not to cast me, but to lie to me?",50
S10E06 Rosss Grant.txt,Chandler,"I'm not lying to you, I watched it!",50
S10E06 Rosss Grant.txt,Chandler,I watched it!,51
S10E06 Rosss Grant.txt,Joey,Keep going Pinocchio!,51
S10E06 Rosss Grant.txt,Rachel,Did you watch the tape?,54
S10E06 Rosss Grant.txt,Benjamin,"The selection committee has chosen the three of you as our finalists today. The ultimate decision will be based upon the answers you give to the questions I ask here. I'm gonna start with Dr. Li. Dr. Li, you claim the field is too reliant on the Linnaean taxonomic system. How do you propose to correct this problem?",56
S10E06 Rosss Grant.txt,Benjamin,"Dr. Biely, your proposal includes some field work. Where might that take place?",58
S10E06 Rosss Grant.txt,Benjamin,"Certainly. Very well. And Dr. Geller, when is my birthday?",58
S10E06 Rosss Grant.txt,Benjamin,Care to venture a guess?,59
S10E06 Rosss Grant.txt,Benjamin,"I see, and Dr. Biely?",61
S10E06 Rosss Grant.txt,Benjamin,"Certainly. Dr. Geller, which 1965 Shirelles hit was later covered by a popular British invasion band?",61
S10E06 Rosss Grant.txt,Benjamin,"No! I'm sorry, we were looking for ""Baby It's You"". Baby It's You.",62
S10E06 Rosss Grant.txt,Ross,"Wha...? Wait, wait, wait, just a minute. None of my questions have anything to do with Paleontology.",62
S10E06 Rosss Grant.txt,Benjamin,"You're right, I apologize. Scratch the last question. Spell ""Boscodictiasaur"".",62
S10E06 Rosss Grant.txt,Benjamin,"Yeah, I just made it up. Spell it.",63
S10E06 Rosss Grant.txt,Benjamin,"No, it starts with a silent ""M"".",64
S10E06 Rosss Grant.txt,Ross,Oh come on!!,64
S10E06 Rosss Grant.txt,Chandler,I can't believe Joey. I hate being called a liar!,65
S10E06 Rosss Grant.txt,Rachel,But you are a liar.,65
S10E06 Rosss Grant.txt,Chandler,What did I just say?,65
S10E06 Rosss Grant.txt,Joey,You still here?,66
S10E06 Rosss Grant.txt,Chandler,"Yes, and I have to say, I am not just hurt. I am insulted. When I tell somebody I did something...",66
S10E06 Rosss Grant.txt,Chandler,Why are you so sure I didn't watch this tape?,67
S10E06 Rosss Grant.txt,Chandler,He really is a chameleon.,72
S10E06 Rosss Grant.txt,Phoebe,Really? It doesn't have anything coming out of it. Or maybe there is some place for her in your bedroom?,80
S10E06 Rosss Grant.txt,Benjamin,I've come here to apologize. I think I may have let my feelings for Charlie interfere with the interview process.,84
S10E06 Rosss Grant.txt,Benjamin,"Anyway, I've decided to offer you the grant.",85
S10E06 Rosss Grant.txt,Benjamin,Well... there is just one small... stipulation...,86
S10E06 Rosss Grant.txt,Ross,I have to break up with Charlie?,86

S10E06 Rosss Grant.txt,Joey,I got it from Monica. She sold it to me for a very reasonable price.,91
S10E06 Rosss Grant.txt,Rachel,"Joey, we're not keeping this!",91
S10E06 Rosss Grant.txt,Joey,But it's an original Buffay...,91
S10E06 Rosss Grant.txt,Rachel,"Alright, fine. You can keep it. As long as you don't mind that she's haunted.",91
S10E06 Rosss Grant.txt,Joey,Hey? what? what? wey! whoo! what? what!?,91
S10E06 Rosss Grant.txt,Rachel,"Well, legend has it Joey, that... she comes alive when you're asleep.",91
S10E06 Rosss Grant.txt,Joey,GET THAT LEGLESS WITCH OUT OF HERE!,93
S10E06 Rosss Grant.txt,Monica,Hey! I sold that to Joey.,94

S10E06 Rosss Grant.txt,Rachel,She's mine!,100
S10E06 Rosss Grant.txt,Chandler,"Look, I'm sorry I didn't give them your tape. And I promise, next time to submit you whether I think you are right for the part or not.",101
S10E06 Rosss Grant.txt,Joey,That's not the point Chandler. The point is that you lied.,101
S10E06 Rosss Grant.txt,Chandler,I know. You're right. What's it gonna take for you to forgive me?,101
S10E06 Rosss Grant.txt,Monica,Oh my God!,102
S10E06 Rosss Grant.txt,Rachel,Excellent!,103

S10E06 Rosss Grant.txt,Chandler,I'm a pretty little girl.,103
S10E06 Rosss Grant.txt,Phoebe,I knew it!,103
S10E06 Rosss Grant.txt,Ross,Your ex-boyfriend is insane.,104
S10E06 Rosss Grant.txt,Charlie,Did you get the grant?,104
S10E06 Rosss Grant.txt,Ross,"No I didn't, and you want to know why? Because your ex-boyfriend is still in love with you.",104
S10E06 Rosss Grant.txt,Charlie,What?,104
S10E06 Rosss Grant.txt,Ross,"Yeah. He wouldn't give me the grant, because I wouldn't give you up.",104
S10E06 Rosss Grant.txt,Charlie,"Benji isn't in love with me. I mean, he broke up with me. And besides, he's a very ethical man.",104
S10E06 Rosss Grant.txt,Ross,"Really? Is it ethical to ask someone in a grant review, who was the voice of ""Underdog""?",104
S10E06 Rosss Grant.txt,Charlie,"I'm sure he was just joking, Ross.",104
S10E06 Rosss Grant.txt,Ross,"If you don't believe me, let's go talk to him, okay? I'm telling you, he didn't ask me one paleontological question.",104
S10E06 Rosss Grant.txt,Charlie,Seriously?,104
S10E06 Rosss Grant.txt,Ross,"Oh, I'm sorry, no. He did ask me one. Uhm... How do you spell Mboscodictiosaur?",104
S10E06 Rosss Grant.txt,Charlie,"Well, if it's like the lake Mbosco in Congo, then M-B-O...",104
S10E06 Rosss Grant.txt,Ross,Damnit!,104
S10E06 Rosss Grant.txt,Benjamin,Dr. Geller...? Charlie... What are you... what are you doing here?,105
S10E06 Rosss Grant.txt,Ross,"I want you to tell her everything. About the deal you tried to make with me, about the crazy questions you... Wally Cox! That's the voice of Underdog!",105
S10E06 Rosss Grant.txt,Benjamin,"Like I tried to tell you in the interview Ross, this grant is not based on your knowledge of pretty useless trivia.",105
S10E06 Rosss Grant.txt,Ross,"No, no, no. Don't do that! I want you to look her in the eyes, and tell her the truth.",105
S10E06 Rosss Grant.txt,Charlie,Benji?,105
S10E06 Rosss Grant.txt,Benjamin,"Alright, it's true. I behaved horribly. But it's only because I still love you. And I would do anything to have you back in my life.",105
S10E06 Rosss Grant.txt,Ross,"Too little, too late, Benji!",105
S10E06 Rosss Grant.txt,Charlie,I can't believe this.,105
S10E06 Rosss Grant.txt,Benjamin,"I never should have broken up with you. I think about you all the time. I mean, do you ever still think about me?",105
S10E06 Rosss Grant.txt,Charlie,Yes!,106
S10E06 Rosss Grant.txt,Ross,What?,106
S10E06 Rosss Grant.txt,Charlie,"I don't know what to say, Benji. This is all so.... romantic.",106
S10E06 Rosss Grant.txt,Ross,or...,106
S10E06 Rosss Grant.txt,Benjamin,"Listen, I know, I may be way out of bounds here, but is there any chance you will take me back?",106
S10E06 Rosss Grant.txt,Charlie,Maybe...,106
S10E06 Rosss Grant.txt,Ross,"Sweetie, this conversation is starting to make me a little uncomfortable.",106
S10E06 Rosss Grant.txt,Benjamin,I love you!,109
S10E06 Rosss Grant.txt,Ross,"Okay, that's it. WE ARE SEEING OTHER PEOPLE!",110

S07E04 Rachels Assistant.txt,Hilda,What?,21
S07E04 Rachels Assistant.txt,Rachel,"I’ve never interviewed anyone before. I’ve actually never had anyone work for me before. Although when I was a kid, we did have a maid, but this is-this isn’t the same thing.",21

S07E04 Rachels Assistant.txt,Chandler,"Hi sweetie. So, what was with all the whispering?",31
S07E04 Rachels Assistant.txt,Monica,I can’t tell you. It’s a secret.,31
S07E04 Rachels Assistant.txt,Chandler,Secret? Married people aren’t supposed to have secrets between one another. We have too much love and respect for one another.,31

S07E04 Rachels Assistant.txt,Monica,"Really? Okay, so why don’t you tell me what happened to Ross Junior year at Disneyland?",32

S07E04 Rachels Assistant.txt,Rachel,"Chandler, you have an assistant right?",35
S07E04 Rachels Assistant.txt,Rachel,"No, I-I just don’t know how you decide who to hire. I mean I’ve got it narrowed down to two people. One of them has great references and a lot of experience and then there’s this guy…",36
S07E04 Rachels Assistant.txt,Chandler,What about him?,36
S07E04 Rachels Assistant.txt,Rachel,I love him. He’s so pretty I wanna cry! I don’t know what to do. Tell me what to do.,36
S07E04 Rachels Assistant.txt,Phoebe,"Come on you know what to do! You hire the first one! You don’t hire an assistant because they’re cute, you hire them because they’re qualified.",36

S07E04 Rachels Assistant.txt,Ross,"And this girl is making eyes at Chandler, okay? So after awhile he-he goes over to her and uh, after a minute or two, I see them kissing. Now, I know what you’re thinking, Chandler’s not the type of guy who just goes to bars and makes out with girls, and you’re right, Chandler’s not the type of guy who just goes to bars and makes out with…girls.",63
S07E04 Rachels Assistant.txt,Chandler,"In my defense, it was dark and he was a very pretty guy.",64
S07E04 Rachels Assistant.txt,Ross,"Oh Mon, I laughed so hard…",64

S04E10 The Girl From Poughkeepsie.txt,Ross,"Not her. Yeah, this is someone else I meet, and I-I can’t decide between the two of them. Y’know the one from Poughkeepsie, even though she’s a two hour train ride away, is really pretty, really smart, and-and a lot of fun. But this other girl, well, she lives right uptown. Y’know she’s, well she’s-she’s just as pretty, I guess she’s smart, she’s not fun.",29
S04E10 The Girl From Poughkeepsie.txt,Phoebe,"If she’s no fun, why do you want to date her at all?",29
S04E10 The Girl From Poughkeepsie.txt,Ross,"Well, I-I want to give her another chance, y’know? She lives so close. And, at the end of the date, the other time, she-she said something that was—if she was kidding was very funny. On the other hand, if she wasn’t kidding, she’s not fun, she’s stupid, and kind of a racist.",29
S04E10 The Girl From Poughkeepsie.txt,Ross,Hey!,30

S04E10 The Girl From Poughkeepsie.txt,Joey,"Yeah. Listen uh, I’d prefer it if you didn’t call me Joey. Since I don’t know anyone here, I thought it’d be cool to try out a cool work nickname.",40
S04E10 The Girl From Poughkeepsie.txt,Monica,"Okay. Could the waiters gather around to hear tonight’s specials? Okay, first there is a Chilean Sea Bass prepared with a Mango relish on a bag—Why is nobody writing these down?",42
S04E10 The Girl From Poughkeepsie.txt,Monica,Because your all gonna make up fake specials and make me cook them like you did the other night?,42
S04E10 The Girl From Poughkeepsie.txt,Joey,No ma’am.,44
S04E10 The Girl From Poughkeepsie.txt,Monica,What the hell happened?!,46

S04E10 The Girl From Poughkeepsie.txt,Joey,"And I gotta pay rent! Look, how-how about this? You don’t fire me, instead I stay here, I gain their trust, and they’ll start listening to all the nice things I’ve been saying about you.",47
S04E10 The Girl From Poughkeepsie.txt,Monica,What kinda things have you been saying?,47
S04E10 The Girl From Poughkeepsie.txt,Joey,"Well nothing yet, they really hate you and I want to fit in.",47

S04E10 The Girl From Poughkeepsie.txt,Phoebe,"So, did you pick one yet?",51
S04E10 The Girl From Poughkeepsie.txt,Ross,"No, it turns out that the one from uptown was making a joke. But it was a different joke than I thought—it wasn’t that funny. So I’m still torn.",51
S04E10 The Girl From Poughkeepsie.txt,Phoebe,"Well look, you don’t really like the one from uptown and you’re too exhausted from dating the one up in Poughkeepsie, so I say you just end them both. Okay? You take a train up to Poughkeepsie and break up with her, and on your way back you break up with uptown. And then by the time you get home tonight, you’re done!",51
S04E10 The Girl From Poughkeepsie.txt,Ross,"Y’know, you’re right. Thank you.",51
S04E10 The Girl From Poughkeepsie.txt,Phoebe,"Umm, well I had a similar problem when I lived in Prague.",51

S04E10 The Girl From Poughkeepsie.txt,Rachel,"Chandler! Patrick just uh, ended things with me. Did you or did you not tell him that I was looking for a serious relationship?",52
S04E10 The Girl From Poughkeepsie.txt,Chandler,I did! I absolutely did!,52
S04E10 The Girl From Poughkeepsie.txt,Rachel,You idiot!!,52
S04E10 The Girl From Poughkeepsie.txt,Chandler,"I’m sure you’re right, but why?",52
S04E10 The Girl From Poughkeepsie.txt,Rachel,You don’t tell a guy that you’re looking for a serious relationship! You don’t tell the guy that! Now you scared him away!,52
S04E10 The Girl From Poughkeepsie.txt,Chandler,"Oh, man. I’m sorry, I’m so-so sorry.",52
S04E10 The Girl From Poughkeepsie.txt,Rachel,"Y’know, you should never be allowed to talk to people!",52
S04E10 The Girl From Poughkeepsie.txt,Chandler,I know! I know!,52

S04E10 The Girl From Poughkeepsie.txt,Monica,Well if you want a problem? I’ll give you a problem!,65
S04E10 The Girl From Poughkeepsie.txt,Joey,What are you gonna do? You’re gonna fire me?,65
S04E10 The Girl From Poughkeepsie.txt,Monica,How about if I dance around all covered in sauce? Huh? You think it’s funny now?,66
S04E10 The Girl From Poughkeepsie.txt,Ross,What?,69

S03E02 No Ones Ready.txt,Monica,"What if it's new? I mean, we agreed not to talk again, unless we had something really important to say. Shouldn't I call him back?",23
S03E02 No Ones Ready.txt,Chandler,"Honey, you did call him back. 'Cause, it's, it's really old.",23
S03E02 No Ones Ready.txt,Ross,"Yeah, see Mon, listen, listen. When Carol and I broke up, I went through the same thing. And you know what I did?",23
S03E02 No Ones Ready.txt,Monica,Huh?,23
S03E02 No Ones Ready.txt,Phoebe,Ah! Oh my God! You r-r-rotten boys!,25

S03E02 No Ones Ready.txt,Phoebe,"Monica, Monica, you know what gets out hummus.",26
S03E02 No Ones Ready.txt,Monica,"If it is a new message, what is he calling to say?",26
S03E02 No Ones Ready.txt,Phoebe,"Okay, thanks. Yeah, I'll try that.",26
S03E02 No Ones Ready.txt,Chandler,Maybe he's calling to say your obsessive and crazy.,26
S03E02 No Ones Ready.txt,Monica,"So, should I call him back?",26
S03E02 No Ones Ready.txt,Joey,"Me too. In fact, I think I might be a little too comfortable.",28
S03E02 No Ones Ready.txt,Ross,"Okay, look, we have nineteen minutes. Okay, Chandler, I want you to go and change! Okay. And then, when you come back, Joey will go change, and he'll have vacated the chair. Okay. Okay.",29
S03E02 No Ones Ready.txt,Phoebe,Hummus. I got the hummus.,31

S03E02 No Ones Ready.txt,All,Nooo.,31
S03E02 No Ones Ready.txt,Monica,"Yes. Well I got his machine and I left a message. But it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, because you know it was like a casual, breezy message. It was breezy! Oh God, what if it wasn't breezy?",31
S03E02 No Ones Ready.txt,Phoebe,"Well, how could it not be breezy, no, 'cause, you're, you're in such a breezy place.",31
S03E02 No Ones Ready.txt,Monica,"Here, I got it. I'll will play my message for you guys, and you can tell me if it's breezy enough.",31
S03E02 No Ones Ready.txt,Joey,"Monica, how are you gonna do that?",31
S03E02 No Ones Ready.txt,Monica,I know the code to his answering machine.,31
S03E02 No Ones Ready.txt,Ross,"Okay, Mon, I really don't think this is the... Okay, you're dialing, you are dialing.",31
S03E02 No Ones Ready.txt,Machine,"""You have two new messages.""",33
S03E02 No Ones Ready.txt,Joey,"Hey, you can't say you're breezy, that, that totally negates the breezy.",35
S03E02 No Ones Ready.txt,Joey,Now she sounded breezy.,36
S03E02 No Ones Ready.txt,Monica,He's seeing someone. I can't believe he's seeing someone.,37
S03E02 No Ones Ready.txt,Phoebe,"Monica, you don't know that.",37
S03E02 No Ones Ready.txt,Monica,"Well, who's voice was that?",37
S03E02 No Ones Ready.txt,Chandler,"Maybe it was his sister's. You know, maybe it was his daughter's.",37
S03E02 No Ones Ready.txt,Monica,"Michelle! Of course, it was Michelle! Did it sound like Michelle?",37
S03E02 No Ones Ready.txt,Ross,"Oh, great. It's starting to rain, that will make it easy to get a cab.",37
S03E02 No Ones Ready.txt,Monica,It was Michelle. It was definitely Michelle.,37
S03E02 No Ones Ready.txt,Rachel,"Pheebs, you go with Monica and try on her green dress. If that doesn't work, you can wear my gray silk one. Oh, gosh, what am I wearing?!",37
S03E02 No Ones Ready.txt,Ross,"You don't, you don't know what your wearing?",37
S03E02 No Ones Ready.txt,Rachel,"Well, hon-ey. I'm just trying to look nice for your big night.",37
S03E02 No Ones Ready.txt,Ross,"Yeah, which, which we have to leave for in exactly twelve minutes. All right, come on, I'll just pick something out for you.",37
S03E02 No Ones Ready.txt,Chandler,"All right, you will notice that I am fully dressed. I, in turn, have noticed that you are not. So in the words of A. A. Milne, ""Get out of my chair, dillhole!""",37
S03E02 No Ones Ready.txt,Chandler,What are you doing?,38
S03E02 No Ones Ready.txt,Joey,"You said I had to give you the chair, you didn't say anything about the cushions.",38
S03E02 No Ones Ready.txt,Chandler,The cushions are the essence of the chair!,38
S03E02 No Ones Ready.txt,Joey,That's right! I'm taking the essence.,38
S03E02 No Ones Ready.txt,Chandler,"Oh-ho, it'll be back. Oh-ho, there's nobody in the room.",38
S03E02 No Ones Ready.txt,Ross,"Look, I'm sorry, I thought it looked pretty.",38
S03E02 No Ones Ready.txt,Rachel,"Ross, that was a Halloween costume, unless you would like me to go to this thing as Little Bo Peep.",38
S03E02 No Ones Ready.txt,Ross,"Look, I didn't recognize it without that inflatable sheep.",38
S03E02 No Ones Ready.txt,Rachel,"Yeah, which, by the way Chandler, I would like back one of these days.",38
S03E02 No Ones Ready.txt,Rachel,"Oh, it's perfect! But not for tonight.",39
S03E02 No Ones Ready.txt,Phoebe,"Well, of course not for tonight. Yeah, hi!",39
S03E02 No Ones Ready.txt,Ross,"Not for tonight. Not for tonight! Wh-what, what, what, are you doing?",39
S03E02 No Ones Ready.txt,Rachel,"No honey, we're sorry, we didn't mean it. I love you. I love you.",39
S03E02 No Ones Ready.txt,Chandler,We used them as pillows when we went camping.,39
S03E02 No Ones Ready.txt,Ross,What?,39
S03E02 No Ones Ready.txt,Ross,"Hey, what you do on your own time...",40
S03E02 No Ones Ready.txt,Ross,"Whoa, whoa, whoa. Come on, come on, what. You took his underwear?",41
S03E02 No Ones Ready.txt,Chandler,He took my essence!,41
S03E02 No Ones Ready.txt,Ross,"Okay, now hold on. Joey, why, why can't you just wear the underwear you're wearing now?",41
S03E02 No Ones Ready.txt,Joey,"Because, I'm not wearing any underwear now.",41
S03E02 No Ones Ready.txt,Ross,"Okay, then why do you have to wear underwear tonight?",41
S03E02 No Ones Ready.txt,Joey,It's a rented tux. Okay. I'm not gonna go commando in another man's fatigues.,41
S03E02 No Ones Ready.txt,Chandler,"Well, then it looks like somebody is gonna have to give back somebody his cushions.",41

S03E02 No Ones Ready.txt,Rachel,"Yeahh, but, but those really go better with pants. Maybe I should wear pants?",45
S03E02 No Ones Ready.txt,Ross,"Yeah, pants, what, what an idea. Or better yet, um, how 'bout you go without any pants. Look, I don't know what you're trying to do to me, but just get your butt in there and pick out any shoes that fit your feet, okay. No, no I don't care if they match. I don't care if they make your ankles or your knees or your earlobes look fat. Okay.",45
S03E02 No Ones Ready.txt,Rachel,But I...,45

S03E02 No Ones Ready.txt,Phoebe,"Okay, we're on it. We're on it.",52
S03E02 No Ones Ready.txt,Ross,"Um. I know it says black tie optional, but, um this may be pushing it a little, um.",53
S03E02 No Ones Ready.txt,Rachel,I'm not gonna gooo.,53
S03E02 No Ones Ready.txt,Ross,You're not going to go.,53
S03E02 No Ones Ready.txt,Rachel,"No, I think I'm gonna catch up on my correspondence.",53
S03E02 No Ones Ready.txt,Ross,"How, how, um how can you not be going?",53
S03E02 No Ones Ready.txt,Rachel,"I'm not gonna gooo, so I think that will accomplish the not going.",53
S03E02 No Ones Ready.txt,Ross,"Um, you know, just out of curiosity...",53
S03E02 No Ones Ready.txt,Rachel,"Well, ever since I was humiliated and yelled at in front of my friends, I'm just, I don't know, not in a museum benefitty kind of mood.",53
S03E02 No Ones Ready.txt,Ross,"Right. Right, okay, okay. I'm sorry. I'm sorry I yelled.",53

S03E02 No Ones Ready.txt,Rachel,"Um, hum.",53
S03E02 No Ones Ready.txt,Ross,Right. So is it gonna be like 'I'm abandoning you while your upset.',53
S03E02 No Ones Ready.txt,Rachel,No.,53
S03E02 No Ones Ready.txt,Ross,"No, because your not upset.",53
S03E02 No Ones Ready.txt,Rachel,Right.,53

S03E02 No Ones Ready.txt,Ross,Okay. Honey?,53
S03E02 No Ones Ready.txt,Chandler,Is it wrong that I was totally aroused by that?,56
S03E02 No Ones Ready.txt,Joey,"Okay, buddy-boy. Here it is. You hide my clothes, I'm wearing everything you own.",57
S03E02 No Ones Ready.txt,Chandler,Oh my God! That is so not the opposite of taking somebody's underwear!!,57
S03E02 No Ones Ready.txt,Joey,Look at me! I'm Chandler! Could I be wearing any more clothes? Maybe if I wasn't going commando...,57
S03E02 No Ones Ready.txt,Chandler,Oooo-ooh!,57
S03E02 No Ones Ready.txt,Ross,"Okay, okay. Enough, enough with the lunging. No! I'm sick of this. Okay. I've had it up to here with you two! Neither you can come to the party!",58
S03E02 No Ones Ready.txt,Chandler,"Jeez, what a baby.",58
S03E02 No Ones Ready.txt,Joey,"Yeah, Ross, way to ruin it. I was just going to get dressed.",58
S03E02 No Ones Ready.txt,Ross,"You know what I don't care. The only person I cared about getting dressed, is the one person that says she's not even gonna go. Look Rach, I'm sorry. Okay. Look, I-I wa, I was a jerk. I'm sorry I yelled. I want you there, I need you there. Look, what, what can I do that can show you how much, how much I want you to be there.",58
S03E02 No Ones Ready.txt,Joey,You could drink the fat.,58
S03E02 No Ones Ready.txt,Ross,"Hi, welcome, to an adult conversation.",58
S03E02 No Ones Ready.txt,Rachel,"No, no, no, now wait, wa, wa, waa-it a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute. That actually, uh, that sounds interesting.",58

S03E02 No Ones Ready.txt,Rachel,I think you should drink the fat.,58
S03E02 No Ones Ready.txt,Joey,Yaaaay!,58
S03E02 No Ones Ready.txt,Ross,"Okay, okay. If that is what it takes to show you how much you mean to me, and how much I want you there. Then that's what I'll do.",58
S03E02 No Ones Ready.txt,Phoebe,"Oh, wait, let me get you another glass. That's been sitting out.",58
S03E02 No Ones Ready.txt,Rachel,"No, no, no, wait! Okay, okay. Don't! I'll go, I'll go!",59
S03E02 No Ones Ready.txt,Ross,You will?!,59
S03E02 No Ones Ready.txt,Rachel,"You were really gonna do that, weren't you?",59
S03E02 No Ones Ready.txt,Ross,"Well, yeah.",59
S03E02 No Ones Ready.txt,Rachel,You were gonna drink the fat.,59
S03E02 No Ones Ready.txt,Joey,Let's see what else he'll do!,59
S03E02 No Ones Ready.txt,Chandler,Stop it. Stop it!,61

S03E02 No Ones Ready.txt,Machine,You have three new messages.,63
S03E02 No Ones Ready.txt,Monica,Not any more!,63
S03E02 No Ones Ready.txt,Machine,Message erased. To record a message begin speaking at the tone.,63
S03E02 No Ones Ready.txt,Monica,"Hi, uh, Richard it's Monica, um, listen I did something kind of crazy tonight, um, maybe I'm getting my period or something, I don't know. Um, anyway, I, I, I beeped into your machine and I heard a message that, that freaked me out, and um, you know what Michelle will tell you the rest. I, I, um, I'm sorry, okay, I, I hope that we can forget the whole thing. Okay, bye.",63
S03E02 No Ones Ready.txt,Machine,Your outgoing message has now been changed.,63
S03E02 No Ones Ready.txt,Monica,"Outgoing! Did that say outgoing?! Not, outgoing!!!",63
S03E02 No Ones Ready.txt,Phoebe,How did you do that?,64
S03E02 No Ones Ready.txt,Monica,I don't know!,64
S03E02 No Ones Ready.txt,Machine,Good-bye.,64
S03E02 No Ones Ready.txt,Monica,Noooo!!!!,64
S03E02 No Ones Ready.txt,Monica,Maybe we could call the phone company. Maybe they could change the message. Maybe they can change his number.,65
S03E02 No Ones Ready.txt,Phoebe,"Yeah, after this, I think he'll be doing that himself.",65
S03E02 No Ones Ready.txt,Ross,So we're a little late.,67
S03E02 No Ones Ready.txt,Ross,What?,68
S03E02 No Ones Ready.txt,Rachel,"I'm going commando, too.",68

S03E02 No Ones Ready.txt,Whitfield,"But, you got up!",70
S03E02 No Ones Ready.txt,Chandler,"But, I never left the room!",70
S03E02 No Ones Ready.txt,Whitfield,"But, you left the chair area.",70
S03E02 No Ones Ready.txt,Chandler,"All right, that's it, give me your underwear.",70
S06E06 On The Last Night.txt,Joey,Right! And when is that due?,3
S06E06 On The Last Night.txt,Chandler,First of the month.,3
S06E06 On The Last Night.txt,Joey,And that’s every month?,3
S06E06 On The Last Night.txt,Chandler,"No, just the months you actually want to live here.",3
S06E06 On The Last Night.txt,Joey,Ahhh.,3
S06E06 On The Last Night.txt,Chandler,"That’s our phone number. Now look, I know I kinda sprung this whole me moving out on thing, so why don’t I just—why don’t I just cover you for a while?",5
S06E06 On The Last Night.txt,Joey,No-no! No way! Joey Tribbiani does not take charity…anymore.,5
S06E06 On The Last Night.txt,Chandler,"It’s not charity, Joe…",5
S06E06 On The Last Night.txt,Joey,"No! Forget it! Okay—I mean thanks, but I’m done taking money from you. All right, I can take of myself. Now, what’s next? Come on.",5
S06E06 On The Last Night.txt,Joey,This is how much we pay for electric?!!!,6
S06E06 On The Last Night.txt,Chandler,"Uh, yeah.",6
S06E06 On The Last Night.txt,Chandler,"So, we’ll do the rest of the bills later then?",7
S06E06 On The Last Night.txt,Phoebe,So is Joey going to have to give up the apartment?,8
S06E06 On The Last Night.txt,Chandler,"No, I hope not! I tried to offer him some money, but he wouldn’t take it.",8
S06E06 On The Last Night.txt,Phoebe,"Well, how much do you think he needs?",8
S06E06 On The Last Night.txt,Chandler,"I figure that $1,500 would cover him for a few months, y’know? But I have to trick him into taking it so I won’t hurt his pride.",8
S06E06 On The Last Night.txt,Phoebe,Why don’t you hire him as an actor? You could have him dress up and put on little skits. Whatever you want.,8
S06E06 On The Last Night.txt,Chandler,Well that would help the pride thing.,8
S06E06 On The Last Night.txt,Chandler,Hey! Wow! You look great! Wanna move in with me tomorrow?,9
S06E06 On The Last Night.txt,Monica,"Well, instead of being sad that tonight is my last night together with Rachel we thought we’d go out to dinner and celebrate the fact that Rachel is moving in with Phoebe.",11
S06E06 On The Last Night.txt,Phoebe,"And also, my birthday.",11
S06E06 On The Last Night.txt,Monica,It’s not your birthday.,11
S06E06 On The Last Night.txt,Phoebe,What a mean thing to say! I would never tell you it’s not your birthday!,11
S06E06 On The Last Night.txt,Joey,Hey!,12
S06E06 On The Last Night.txt,Ross,Hey!,12
S06E06 On The Last Night.txt,Chandler,Hey!,12
S06E06 On The Last Night.txt,Phoebe,Hey! So you guys have anything planned for the big last night?,12
S06E06 On The Last Night.txt,Chandler,"Well, instead of just hanging out, we figure we’d do nothing.",12
S06E06 On The Last Night.txt,Ross,"Whoa-whoa-whoa, Knicks season opener tonight. I thought maybe you guys would come over and watch it.",12
S06E06 On The Last Night.txt,Joey,"I don’t know Ross, not if you’re gonna talk about how you gave up a career in basketball to become a paleontologist.",12
S06E06 On The Last Night.txt,Ross,I did give up a career in basketball to become a paleontologist!,12
S06E06 On The Last Night.txt,Monica,You’re not dressed yet?! We’re supposed to start having fun in 15 minutes!,13
S06E06 On The Last Night.txt,Rachel,Well and clearly not a minute sooner.,13
S06E06 On The Last Night.txt,Monica,"Rachel, you are packed though right, I mean please tell me that you’re packed.",13
S06E06 On The Last Night.txt,Rachel,Of course I packed! Monica relax! I just wanted to ask Phoebe her opinion on what I should wear tonight.,13
S06E06 On The Last Night.txt,Phoebe,"My God, I can’t get a minute of peace around this place.",13
S06E06 On The Last Night.txt,Phoebe,Oh my God! Monica’s just gonna kill you.,14
S06E06 On The Last Night.txt,Rachel,"Yeah, yeah, I know.",14
S06E06 On The Last Night.txt,Phoebe,"Well, what you’re wearing is fine for that.",14
S06E06 On The Last Night.txt,Rachel,Surprise!!,15
S06E06 On The Last Night.txt,Monica,What?,15
S06E06 On The Last Night.txt,Rachel,"No, no don’t get mad because look—this is what happened. So I-I started packing, then I realized, ""What am I doing? I am lousy at packing!"" Right? But you love packing! So, as a gift to you, on our last night, ta-da!",15
S06E06 On The Last Night.txt,Phoebe,I have plans.,16
S06E06 On The Last Night.txt,Monica,You’re plans were with us.,16
S06E06 On The Last Night.txt,Phoebe,That’s right.,16
S06E06 On The Last Night.txt,Monica,"All right, Chandler can make boxes, Ross can wrap, and Joey can lift things. Now Phoebe, go tell the guys they have to help out!",16
S06E06 On The Last Night.txt,Phoebe,Okay.,16
S06E06 On The Last Night.txt,Chandler,"Oh nope, I-I have plans with Joey.",20
S06E06 On The Last Night.txt,Monica,I thought you said you were going to do nothing.,20
S06E06 On The Last Night.txt,Chandler,"Yes, but for the last time.",20
S06E06 On The Last Night.txt,Monica,"Okay fine, now Ross…",20
S06E06 On The Last Night.txt,Ross,"Oh, but-but I can’t do it.",20
S06E06 On The Last Night.txt,Monica,Why not?,20
S06E06 On The Last Night.txt,Ross,"Because, because I’ve got Ben.",21
S06E06 On The Last Night.txt,Monica,"It’s almost 8 o’clock, it’s almost past his bedtime. Where-where is he?",21
S06E06 On The Last Night.txt,Chandler,He’s at a dinner party.,21
S06E06 On The Last Night.txt,Monica,Is he really coming? Because I can see right into your apartment!,21
S06E06 On The Last Night.txt,Ross,"Of course he is! What, do you think I’d just use my son as-as an excuse? What kind of father do you think I am?",21
S06E06 On The Last Night.txt,Joey,Here it is! Our last pizzas together as roommates.,24
S06E06 On The Last Night.txt,Chandler,"Oh, I wish I’d know you were going to do that, I ordered Chinese.",24
S06E06 On The Last Night.txt,Joey,"Oh that’s okay. Hey, actually in a way it’s kinda nice. Me, bringing the food of my ancestors, you, the food of yours!",24
S06E06 On The Last Night.txt,Chandler,"Say, Joe, I had a strange idea of what we could do for our last night. What do you say we play a little uh, foosball for money?",25
S06E06 On The Last Night.txt,Joey,"What, are you crazy? You haven’t beaten me once since my injury plagued ’97 season. It would be easier if you just give me your money.",25
S06E06 On The Last Night.txt,Chandler,Yes it would. What do you say to $50?,25
S06E06 On The Last Night.txt,Joey,"Okay, you’re on.",25
S06E06 On The Last Night.txt,Chandler,"Okay, let’s play! The big game, Italy vs. China, apparently.",25
S06E06 On The Last Night.txt,Rachel,"Ohhhhhh, look it’s the roller blades.",27
S06E06 On The Last Night.txt,Rachel,You remember when we got these?,28
S06E06 On The Last Night.txt,Monica,No.,28
S06E06 On The Last Night.txt,Rachel,"I’m sorry Pheebs, I guess I’m just really said that I’m leaving.",30
S06E06 On The Last Night.txt,Monica,I’m gonna miss you so much.,30
S06E06 On The Last Night.txt,Phoebe,"Well, this doesn’t have to be so sad though. Y’know? Maybe instead of just thinking about how much you’re gonna miss each other, you should like think of the things you’re not gonna miss.",30
S06E06 On The Last Night.txt,Monica,I don’t think there’s anything.,30
S06E06 On The Last Night.txt,Phoebe,"Come on, there’s gotta be something.",30
S06E06 On The Last Night.txt,Monica,"Nope, she’s perfect.",30
S06E06 On The Last Night.txt,Rachel,I have one.,30
S06E06 On The Last Night.txt,Phoebe,Good! Great! You can go first.,30
S06E06 On The Last Night.txt,Phoebe,"Good that’s a good one. Okay, Monica, anything? Y’know? Does Rachel move the phone pen?",31
S06E06 On The Last Night.txt,Monica,"Aw, sometimes. Always, actually.",31
S06E06 On The Last Night.txt,Phoebe,"Okay, good. There you go. Doesn’t anyone feel better?",31
S06E06 On The Last Night.txt,Monica,Not just the phone pen. I never get my messages.,31
S06E06 On The Last Night.txt,Rachel,You get your messages!,31
S06E06 On The Last Night.txt,Monica,"Yeah, well I don’t think it really counts if you have to read them off the back of your hand after you fall asleep on the couch.",31
S06E06 On The Last Night.txt,Rachel,"So-so, you missed a message from who? Chandler or your mom? Or Chandler? Or your mom?",31
S06E06 On The Last Night.txt,Phoebe,Great! It worked! No one’s sad.,31

S06E06 On The Last Night.txt,Joey,"Okay, here we go. Ready?",33
S06E06 On The Last Night.txt,Chandler,"See? Now, that’s why only the little fake men are supposed to do all the kicking.",36
S06E06 On The Last Night.txt,Rachel,"Ooh, your brother. Score!",38
S06E06 On The Last Night.txt,Ross,"Oh, I’m just over here with Ben. I thought we’d say hi.",39
S06E06 On The Last Night.txt,Monica,"Oh, put him on!",39
S06E06 On The Last Night.txt,Phoebe,"Yeah, I think it was better when you guys were sad. Hey, uh, remember the roller blades?",41
S06E06 On The Last Night.txt,Rachel,"You know what else I’m not gonna miss? ""I’m Monica. I wash the toilet 17 times a day. Even if people are on it!""",41
S06E06 On The Last Night.txt,Monica,"""Hi I’m Rachel, is my sweater too tight? No? Oh, I’d better wash it and shrink it!""",41

S06E06 On The Last Night.txt,Chandler,Still broken?,44
S06E06 On The Last Night.txt,Joey,"This sucks man! The last night you’re here and I lose the two most important things in my life, the foosball table and $500.",44
S06E06 On The Last Night.txt,Joey,"Nah, not my game.",45
S06E06 On The Last Night.txt,Chandler,"Okay, uh, how about, how about—y’know what? We could play a new game. A new game, it’s fun.",45
S06E06 On The Last Night.txt,Joey,"Well, what’s it called?",45
S06E06 On The Last Night.txt,Chandler,Cups.,45

S06E06 On The Last Night.txt,Monica,I’m not talking to her!,49
S06E06 On The Last Night.txt,Phoebe,"Well, one of you has to take the first step! And it should be you, because she’s the one who’s leaving. It’s harder for her!",49
S06E06 On The Last Night.txt,Monica,"Well, maybe you’re right—She made fun of my phone pen!",49
S06E06 On The Last Night.txt,Phoebe,"I know, I took it hard too.",49
S06E06 On The Last Night.txt,Rachel,I’m unpacking!,51

S06E24 The Proposal Part I  II.txt,Monica,"Ohh… Oh, that’s okay I hate when people come back to complement the chef. Like I have nothing better to do! So what’s up?",130
S06E24 The Proposal Part I  II.txt,Richard,"Well, it was great seeing you the other night.",130
S06E24 The Proposal Part I  II.txt,Monica,"Oh, good to see you too. Did you come down here to tell me that?",130
S06E24 The Proposal Part I  II.txt,Monica,What uh—What did you—What?!,132
S06E24 The Proposal Part I  II.txt,Richard,"I still love you. And I know I probably shouldn’t even be here telling you this, I mean you’re with Chandler a guy I really like, and if you say he’s straight I’ll believe you! After seeing ya the other night I knew if I didn’t tell ya I’d regret it for the rest of my life. Letting you go was the stupidest thing I ever did.",132
S06E24 The Proposal Part I  II.txt,Monica,Y’know you’re really not supposed to be back here!,132
S06E24 The Proposal Part I  II.txt,Richard,"Well yeah, I’m sorry. I know this is the wrong time and the wrong place but I had to tell ya! I wanna spend my life with you. I wanna marry you. I wanna have kids with you.",132
S06E24 The Proposal Part I  II.txt,Richard,I know this is crazy but am I too late?,133
S06E24 The Proposal Part I  II.txt,Monica,What the… Yes you’re too late! Where was all this three years ago?!,133
S06E24 The Proposal Part I  II.txt,Richard,"Well I know I was an idiot! And I tried to forget you, I really did! Y’know after we had lunch last year I spent six months in Africa trying to get you out of my head!",133
S06E24 The Proposal Part I  II.txt,Monica,What were you doing in Africa?,133
S06E24 The Proposal Part I  II.txt,Richard,Working with blind kids.,133
S06E24 The Proposal Part I  II.txt,Monica,"Ohhh! What are you doing to me?! Oh look, I-I… I’m sorry but umm, this-this-this-this is not going to happen.",133
S06E24 The Proposal Part I  II.txt,Richard,"Okay that’s fine, I’ll walk away. And I’ll never bother you again, but only if you tell me Chandler’s willing to give you everything I am.",133
S06E24 The Proposal Part I  II.txt,Monica,"Well he is! Yeah, I mean marriage is all he talks about! My goodness, in fact, I’m the one that’s making him wait!",133
S06E24 The Proposal Part I  II.txt,Richard,You are?,133
S06E24 The Proposal Part I  II.txt,Monica,Yeah!,133
S06E24 The Proposal Part I  II.txt,Richard,Why?,133
S06E24 The Proposal Part I  II.txt,Monica,Why? Because of the government.,133
S06E24 The Proposal Part I  II.txt,Rachel,"Isn’t it incredible?! Monica and Chandler, gettin’ married.",134
S06E24 The Proposal Part I  II.txt,Phoebe,"I know, they’re gonna be so happy together.",134
S06E24 The Proposal Part I  II.txt,Rachel,"Ohh… I mean two best friends falling in love, how often does that happen?",134
S06E24 The Proposal Part I  II.txt,Phoebe,Not that often!,134
S06E24 The Proposal Part I  II.txt,Rachel,No! I’m so happy for them!,134
S06E24 The Proposal Part I  II.txt,Phoebe,Me too! So happy for them!,134
S06E24 The Proposal Part I  II.txt,Rachel,I’m so happy and not at all jealous.,134
S06E24 The Proposal Part I  II.txt,Phoebe,"Oh no! No God, definitely not jealous!",134
S06E24 The Proposal Part I  II.txt,Rachel,"I mean I’m probably 98% happy, maybe 2% jealous. And I mean what’s 2%? That’s nothing.",135
S06E24 The Proposal Part I  II.txt,Phoebe,Totally. I’m like 90/10.,135
S06E24 The Proposal Part I  II.txt,Rachel,Yeah me too.,135
S06E24 The Proposal Part I  II.txt,Joey,"Hey uh, have you guys scene Chandler?",136
S06E24 The Proposal Part I  II.txt,Monica,"So that marriage stuff that you were saying yesterday, you don’t really believe that do you?",138
S06E24 The Proposal Part I  II.txt,Chandler,"Sure I do. In fact, I think the whole concept of marriage is unnatural. I mean look at pigs. Let’s take a second here and look at pigs. Okay pigs don’t mate for life. I mean a pig can have like a hundred sexual partners in a lifetime, and that’s just an ordinary pig not even a pig that’s good at sports!",138
S06E24 The Proposal Part I  II.txt,Monica,"Yeah, but that’s pigs not people!",138
S06E24 The Proposal Part I  II.txt,Chandler,"If marriage worked, I’d be all for it. But do you know what the divorce rate in this country is? 97%.",138
S06E24 The Proposal Part I  II.txt,Monica,Wait a minute. Are you honestly telling me that-that you may never want to get married?,138
S06E24 The Proposal Part I  II.txt,Chandler,"Well, never say never but y’know probably uh yeah, never.",138
S06E24 The Proposal Part I  II.txt,Monica,Oh my God! Then-then-then what are we even doing?! What is this?!,138
S06E24 The Proposal Part I  II.txt,Chandler,Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! What is all this pressure?! Is this some new kind of strategy? Why don’t you put down your copy of ‘The Rules’ huh mantrap?!,138
S06E24 The Proposal Part I  II.txt,Monica,Y’know what?! I gotta go! Ugh!,138
S06E24 The Proposal Part I  II.txt,Rachel,We’re gonna find love!,141
S06E24 The Proposal Part I  II.txt,Phoebe,Definitely!,141
S06E24 The Proposal Part I  II.txt,Rachel,"Yeah, I’m pretty confident about that. That’s what makes it so easy for me to be 80% happy for Monica and Chandler! It would be nice to have a little guarantee though.",141
S06E24 The Proposal Part I  II.txt,Phoebe,What do you mean?,141
S06E24 The Proposal Part I  II.txt,Rachel,"Well y’know, some people make deals with a friend, like if neither of them are married by the time they’re 40, they marry each other.",141
S06E24 The Proposal Part I  II.txt,Phoebe,You mean a backup?,141
S06E24 The Proposal Part I  II.txt,Rachel,Exactly!,141
S06E24 The Proposal Part I  II.txt,Phoebe,"Yeah, yeah I got that.",141

S06E24 The Proposal Part I  II.txt,Phoebe,"Yeah, I locked him years ago!",141
S06E24 The Proposal Part I  II.txt,Rachel,"Wh… So… If neither of you are married by the time you’re 40, you’re gonna marry Joey.",141
S06E24 The Proposal Part I  II.txt,Phoebe,"Yep, we shook on it. Yeah but believe me that is not how he wanted to seal the deal.",141
S06E24 The Proposal Part I  II.txt,Rachel,"Oh, seriously?",141
S06E24 The Proposal Part I  II.txt,Rachel,Charming.,142
S06E24 The Proposal Part I  II.txt,Phoebe,"Well hey, it’s just a backup.",142

S06E24 The Proposal Part I  II.txt,Monica,I’m just having one of those days where you realize you’re in a dead-end relationship!,143
S06E24 The Proposal Part I  II.txt,Joey,Chandler giving you a hard time huh?,143
S06E24 The Proposal Part I  II.txt,Monica,"It’s not like I want to get married tomorrow! It’s just that I-I’d like to believe that I’m in a relationship that’s actually going somewhere, that I’m not just wasting my time!",143
S06E24 The Proposal Part I  II.txt,Joey,"Well, you know Chandler.",143
S06E24 The Proposal Part I  II.txt,Monica,No I don’t know Chandler! Not anymore! It’s like it’s like something’s changed.,143
S06E24 The Proposal Part I  II.txt,Joey,Maybe you changed?,143
S06E24 The Proposal Part I  II.txt,Monica,I didn’t change!,143
S06E24 The Proposal Part I  II.txt,Joey,Maybe that’s the problem.,143
S06E24 The Proposal Part I  II.txt,Monica,What?!,143
S06E24 The Proposal Part I  II.txt,Joey,"Chandler is a complex fellow, one who is unlikely to take a wife.",143
S06E24 The Proposal Part I  II.txt,Monica,Is that some kind of boat talk?,143
S06E24 The Proposal Part I  II.txt,Monica,What does he think? Does he think I’m just gonna wait around for nothing?,144
S06E24 The Proposal Part I  II.txt,Joey,"Monica face it, Chandler is against marriage. And-and always will be!",144

S06E24 The Proposal Part I  II.txt,Monica,You just told me that he hates marriage! That-that he’s a-a complex fellow who’s unlikely to take a wife! That-that he’s against marriage and always will be!,146
S06E24 The Proposal Part I  II.txt,Joey,You got that from what I said?!,146
S06E24 The Proposal Part I  II.txt,Narrator,"When the Cretaceous period ended, the dinosaurs were gone.",147
S06E24 The Proposal Part I  II.txt,Ross,What happened you guys?,147
S06E24 The Proposal Part I  II.txt,Ross,Rach!,148
S06E24 The Proposal Part I  II.txt,Rachel,Hey you!,148

S06E24 The Proposal Part I  II.txt,Ross,"Oh, thanks. Yeah, I really thought we’d be able to make it work, but uh, I guess it just wasn’t meant to be.",148
S06E24 The Proposal Part I  II.txt,Rachel,"Yeah, love. It’s a tricky business isn’t it?",148
S06E24 The Proposal Part I  II.txt,Ross,I guess so.,148
S06E24 The Proposal Part I  II.txt,Rachel,"So what do you say we make a pact? If you and I are both single by the time we’re 40, we get married. I mean, we know each other, we like each other, and we’ve-we’ve already slept together so y’know there’ll be no surprises there! You know what I mean? No like, ""What’s that?!""",148
S06E24 The Proposal Part I  II.txt,Ross,Right. Ohh! You-you want me to be your backup.,148

S06E24 The Proposal Part I  II.txt,Ross,"Ohh, I don’t think so.",148
S06E24 The Proposal Part I  II.txt,Rachel,"Ross! I just had a conversation with her, and she said that she and Joey made a deal!",148
S06E24 The Proposal Part I  II.txt,Ross,"That’s impossible! I mean we have had a deal for years! We-we-we shook on it, although believe me she wanted to do a lot more than that.",148
S06E24 The Proposal Part I  II.txt,Joey,Where the hell have you been?!,149
S06E24 The Proposal Part I  II.txt,Chandler,I was making a coconut phone with the professor.,149
S06E24 The Proposal Part I  II.txt,Joey,Richard told Monica he wants to marry her!,149
S06E24 The Proposal Part I  II.txt,Chandler,What?!,149

S06E24 The Proposal Part I  II.txt,Joey,I know!,150
S06E24 The Proposal Part I  II.txt,Joey,"Look, Chandler I don’t think us getting our asses kicked is a solution. Okay? Just go and find Monica!",151

S06E24 The Proposal Part I  II.txt,Chandler,What?!,152
S06E24 The Proposal Part I  II.txt,Joey,"Let me know about that coconut phone, it might great for the boat.",152
S06E24 The Proposal Part I  II.txt,Monica,Hi.,153

S06E24 The Proposal Part I  II.txt,Monica,I don’t know why I’m here.,153
S06E24 The Proposal Part I  II.txt,Richard,I didn’t ask. You wanna come in?,153
S06E24 The Proposal Part I  II.txt,Monica,I don’t know.,153
S06E24 The Proposal Part I  II.txt,Monica,"Yeah, I’ll have a scotch…",156

S06E24 The Proposal Part I  II.txt,Monica,"No that’s, that’s okay.",158
S06E24 The Proposal Part I  II.txt,Richard,"So Monica let me ask you a question. Y’know, since we broke up do you ever, think about me?",158

S06E24 The Proposal Part I  II.txt,Richard,Oh really?,158
S06E24 The Proposal Part I  II.txt,Monica,Yeah but it was because I-I had an eye exam and I don’t like my new eye doctor.,158

S06E24 The Proposal Part I  II.txt,Richard,Ahh.,159
S06E24 The Proposal Part I  II.txt,Monica,But getting over was the hardest thing that I’ve ever had to do. And I never let myself think about you.,159
S06E24 The Proposal Part I  II.txt,Rachel,Phoebe! You picked Joey and Ross?! You can not have two backups!,161
S06E24 The Proposal Part I  II.txt,Phoebe,"Of course I can! It’s just good sense to backup your backup! Look, I’ve already lost Chandler!",161
S06E24 The Proposal Part I  II.txt,Rachel,What?!,161
S06E24 The Proposal Part I  II.txt,Ross,"Phoebe, how could you do this to me?!",164
S06E24 The Proposal Part I  II.txt,Phoebe,I don’t—Look I don’t know what you’re complaining about now? You were both aware of the situation!,164
S06E24 The Proposal Part I  II.txt,Joey,No we weren’t!,165
S06E24 The Proposal Part I  II.txt,Ross,I was not!,165
S06E24 The Proposal Part I  II.txt,Phoebe,"Okay, this kind of back talk is not gonna fly when we’re married!",165
S06E24 The Proposal Part I  II.txt,Rachel,Phoebe you can’t have both of them! You have to pick one!,165
S06E24 The Proposal Part I  II.txt,Joey,Pick me!!,165
S06E24 The Proposal Part I  II.txt,Ross,No! Pick me! I don’t want to end up an old maid!,165

S06E24 The Proposal Part I  II.txt,Joey,"This is crazy! Hey look, I wanna switch to Rachel!",165
S06E24 The Proposal Part I  II.txt,Ross,"Ooh, I wanna switch to Rachel too!",165
S06E24 The Proposal Part I  II.txt,Phoebe,"No wait! Just—Okay—Just wait! You guys! Wait you guys! Don’t make any rash decisions, okay? Just remember my promise, when we get married, three times a week.",166
S06E24 The Proposal Part I  II.txt,Rachel,"Oh God, Phoebe!",166
S06E24 The Proposal Part I  II.txt,Rachel,Oh.,167
S06E24 The Proposal Part I  II.txt,Joey,Okay that’s fair.,169

S06E24 The Proposal Part I  II.txt,Joey,Yeah.,174
S06E24 The Proposal Part I  II.txt,Richard,Excuse me?,176

S06E24 The Proposal Part I  II.txt,Monica,"Y’know, let’s face it, I’m not a kid anymore! I-I need to be with someone who-who wants the same things that I do! I mean coming to my place of work and telling me that you love me, I want that! Talking about pig sex over lunch, I don’t want that!",178
S06E24 The Proposal Part I  II.txt,Richard,I think that’s fair.,178
S06E24 The Proposal Part I  II.txt,Monica,"Fair? Please don’t even talk to me about fair! Fair would’ve been you wanting to marry me back then! Or fair would’ve been Chandler wanting to marry me now! Believe me, nothing about this is fair! Nothing! Nothing! Nothing! Nothing! Nothing! Nothing! Nothing! Nothing! Nothing! Nothing!",178

S06E24 The Proposal Part I  II.txt,Richard,Well she said she had to think things over.,185

S06E24 The Proposal Part I  II.txt,Richard,"Oh, hey look nothing happened.",185
S06E24 The Proposal Part I  II.txt,Chandler,Nothing happened? Nothing? So you didn’t tell my girlfriend that you love her?,185

S06E24 The Proposal Part I  II.txt,Richard,"Well, apparently I’m willing to offer her things that you are not.",185
S06E24 The Proposal Part I  II.txt,Chandler,"But I am willing to offer her all those things. This was just a plan, y’know? A way to throw her off course so that when I offered her all these things, she’d be surprised!",185
S06E24 The Proposal Part I  II.txt,Richard,"Well if it helps, it worked very well.",185
S06E24 The Proposal Part I  II.txt,Chandler,Y’know Richard…you are a good guy.,189
S06E24 The Proposal Part I  II.txt,Joey,Dude!,192

S06E24 The Proposal Part I  II.txt,Chandler,Well why didn’t you stop her?! Why didn’t you just tell her it was a plan?!,192
S06E24 The Proposal Part I  II.txt,Joey,"I-I did! I told her everything, Chandler! But she wouldn’t believe me.",192
S06E24 The Proposal Part I  II.txt,Chandler,Well where… Where did she go?,192
S06E24 The Proposal Part I  II.txt,Joey,To her parent’s I think and she said you shouldn’t call her. But if I were you I would.,192

S01E13 The Boobies.txt,Chandler,That's a relatively open weave and I can still see your... nipular areas.,2

S01E13 The Boobies.txt,Chandler,Okay.,6
S01E13 The Boobies.txt,Roger,"Did I, uh, did I miss something?",6
S01E13 The Boobies.txt,Chandler,"No, she's still upset because I saw her boobies.",6
S01E13 The Boobies.txt,Ross,You what? Wh what were you doing seeing her boobies?,6
S01E13 The Boobies.txt,Chandler,It was an accident. Not like I was across the street with a telescope and a box of donuts.,6
S01E13 The Boobies.txt,Rachel,"Okay, okay, could we change the subject, please?",6
S01E13 The Boobies.txt,Phoebe,"Yeah, 'cause hello, these are not her boobies, these are her breasts.",6
S01E13 The Boobies.txt,Rachel,"Okay, Pheebs, I was hoping for more of a change.",6
S01E13 The Boobies.txt,Chandler,"Y'know, I don't know why you're so embarrassed, they were very nice boobies.",6
S01E13 The Boobies.txt,Rachel,"Nice? They were nice. I mean, that's it? I mean, mittens are nice.",6
S01E13 The Boobies.txt,Roger,You're so funny! He's really funny! I wouldn't wanna be there when when the laughter stops.,7
S01E13 The Boobies.txt,Chandler,"Whoah whoah, back up there, Sparky. What'd you mean by that?",7
S01E13 The Boobies.txt,Roger,"Oh, just seems as though that maybe you have intimacy issues. Y'know, that you use your humour as a way of keeping people at a distance.",7
S01E13 The Boobies.txt,Chandler,Huh.,7
S01E13 The Boobies.txt,Roger,"I mean hey! I just met you, I don't know you from Adam. ...Only child, right? Parents divorced before you hit puberty.",7
S01E13 The Boobies.txt,Chandler,"Uhhuh, how did you know that?",7
S01E13 The Boobies.txt,Roger,It's textbook.,7
S01E13 The Boobies.txt,Joey,"Hey you guys. Hey, you all know my dad, right?",8
S01E13 The Boobies.txt,All,"Hey! Hey, Mr. Trib!",8
S01E13 The Boobies.txt,Monica,"Hey, how long are you in the city?",8
S01E13 The Boobies.txt,Phoebe,"Oh, this is my friend Roger.",9
S01E13 The Boobies.txt,Roger,Hi.,9
S01E13 The Boobies.txt,Roger,"You too, sir.",9
S01E13 The Boobies.txt,Joey,Since then?!,17
S01E13 The Boobies.txt,Joey,...I d'know.,17
S01E13 The Boobies.txt,Joey,Oh man. Please tell me one of 'em is Ma.,18
S01E13 The Boobies.txt,Rachel,Did you not get a good enough look the other day?,22
S01E13 The Boobies.txt,Ross,"Alright, alright. We're all adults here, there's only one way to resolve this. Since you saw her boobies, I think, uh, you're gonna have to show her your peepee.",22
S01E13 The Boobies.txt,Chandler,"Y'know, I don't see that happening?",22
S01E13 The Boobies.txt,Rachel,"C'mon, he's right. Tit for tat.",22
S01E13 The Boobies.txt,Chandler,Well I'm not showing you my 'tat.',22
S01E13 The Boobies.txt,Monica,Hello?,23
S01E13 The Boobies.txt,Monica,C'mon up.,25
S01E13 The Boobies.txt,Joey,What's the matter with Rog?,26
S01E13 The Boobies.txt,Ross,Yeah.,26
S01E13 The Boobies.txt,Chandler,"Oh, it's nothing, it's a little thing... I hate that guy.",26
S01E13 The Boobies.txt,Ross,"What, so he was a little analytical. That's what he does, y'know? C'mon, he's not that bad.",26
S01E13 The Boobies.txt,Ross,"Y'see, that's where you're wrong. Why would I marry her if I thought on any level thatthat she was a lesbian?",27
S01E13 The Boobies.txt,Roger,I dunno. Maybe you wanted your marriage to fail.,27
S01E13 The Boobies.txt,Ross,Why? Why would I why? Why? Why? Why?,27
S01E13 The Boobies.txt,Roger,"I don't know. Maybe maybe low self-esteem, maybe maybe to compensate for overshadowing a sibling, maybe you...",27
S01E13 The Boobies.txt,Monica,"Wait-wait, go back to that sibling thing.",27
S01E13 The Boobies.txt,Roger,"Well, I don't know. I mean, it's conceivable that you wanted to sabotage your marriage so that the sibling would feel less of a failure in the eyes of the parents.",27
S01E13 The Boobies.txt,Ross,That that's ridiculous! I don't feel guilty for her failures!,27
S01E13 The Boobies.txt,Monica,Oh! So you think I'm a failure!,27
S01E13 The Boobies.txt,Phoebe,Isn't he good?,27
S01E13 The Boobies.txt,Ross,"Nonono, thatthat's not what I was saying...",27
S01E13 The Boobies.txt,Monica,"Y'know, all these years, I thought you were on my side. But maybe what you were doing was sucking up to Mom and Dad so they'd keep liking you better!",27
S01E13 The Boobies.txt,Ross,"Hey, I married a lesbian to make you look good!",27
S01E13 The Boobies.txt,Rachel,"You're right! I mean you're right! It wasn't just the Weebles, but it was the Weeble Play Palace, and and the Weebles' Cruise Ship. Oh, which had this little lifeboat for the Weebles to wobble in.",28
S01E13 The Boobies.txt,Roger,"That's tough. Tough stuff. C'mon, Pheebs, we're gonna catch that movie, we gotta get going.",28
S01E13 The Boobies.txt,Phoebe,"Oh, okay. Feel better, Rachel, 'kay?",28
S01E13 The Boobies.txt,Roger,"Geez, we're gonna be late, sweetie...",28
S01E13 The Boobies.txt,Phoebe,"Oh, okay. Listen, thanks for everything, Mon.",28
S01E13 The Boobies.txt,Monica,You're welcome.,28
S01E13 The Boobies.txt,Roger,"Listen guys, it was great seeing you again. Mon, um, easy on those cookies, okay? Remember, they're just food, they're not love.",28
S01E13 The Boobies.txt,Joey,"Night, you guys.",31
S01E13 The Boobies.txt,Chandler,"Oh look, it's the woman we ordered.",32
S01E13 The Boobies.txt,Joey,"Hey. Can, uh, can we help you?",32
S01E13 The Boobies.txt,Ronni,"Oh, no thanks, I'm just waiting for, uh, Joey Tribbiani.",32
S01E13 The Boobies.txt,Joey,I'm Joey Tribbiani.,32
S01E13 The Boobies.txt,Chandler,"Uh, Joey's having an embolism, but I'd go for a Nip, y'know?",33
S01E13 The Boobies.txt,Chandler,"Joey, if I go first, I wanna be looking for my keys.",35
S01E13 The Boobies.txt,Ronni,That's a good one!,35
S01E13 The Boobies.txt,Joey,"Dad, Ronni's here.",36
S01E13 The Boobies.txt,Ronni,Hi.,36
S01E13 The Boobies.txt,Chandler,"So, who's up for a big game of Kerplunk?",37
S01E13 The Boobies.txt,Ronni,"Look, I uh, I shouldn'ta come. I-I'd better get going, I don't wanna miss the last train.",37
S01E13 The Boobies.txt,Ronni,"Oh, where'm I gonna stay, here?",37
S01E13 The Boobies.txt,Joey,Who-ah-ho.,37
S01E13 The Boobies.txt,Joey,No you won't.,38
S01E13 The Boobies.txt,Ronni,No we won't.,38
S01E13 The Boobies.txt,Joey,If you go to a hotel you'll be...doing stuff. I want you right here where I can keep an eye on you.,38
S01E13 The Boobies.txt,Joey,"That's right, mister, and I don't care how old you are, as long as you're under my roof you're gonna live by my rules. And that means no sleeping with your girlfriend.",38
S01E13 The Boobies.txt,Ronni,Wow. He's strict.,38
S01E13 The Boobies.txt,Joey,"Now dad, you'll be in my room, Ronni uh, you can stay in Chandler's room.",38
S01E13 The Boobies.txt,Ronni,"Thanks. You're, uh, you're a good kid.",38
S01E13 The Boobies.txt,Chandler,"C'mon, I'll show you to my room. ...That sounds so weird when it's not followed by ""No thanks, it's late.""",38
S01E13 The Boobies.txt,Joey,"Okay. Now this is just for tonight. Starting tomorrow, you gotta make a change. This has gone on long enough.",38
S01E13 The Boobies.txt,Joey,"Well, either you break it off with Ronni",38
S01E13 The Boobies.txt,Joey,Then you gotta come clean with Ma! This is not right!,38
S01E13 The Boobies.txt,Joey,I don't wanna hear it! Now go to my room!,38
S01E13 The Boobies.txt,Chandler,"Hey, Kicky. What're you doing?",39
S01E13 The Boobies.txt,Joey,Just trying to get comfortable. I can't sleep in my underwear.,39
S01E13 The Boobies.txt,Chandler,"Well, you're gonna.",39
S01E13 The Boobies.txt,Joey,"I've been thinking. Y'know, about how I'm always seeing girls on top of girls...",39
S01E13 The Boobies.txt,Chandler,"Are they end to end, or tall like pancakes?",39
S01E13 The Boobies.txt,Joey,"Y'know what I mean, about how I'm always going out with all these women. And I always figured, when the right one comes along, I'd be able to be a stand-up guy and go the distance, y'know? Now I'm looking at my dad, thinking...",39
S01E13 The Boobies.txt,Chandler,"Hey, you're not him. You're you. When they were all over you to go into your father's pipe-fitting business, did you cave?",39
S01E13 The Boobies.txt,Joey,No.,39
S01E13 The Boobies.txt,Chandler,"No. You decided to go into the out-of-work actor business. Now that wasn't easy, but you did it! And I'd like to believe that when the right woman comes along, you will have the courage and the guts to say ""No thanks, I'm married.""",39
S01E13 The Boobies.txt,Joey,You really think so?,39
S01E13 The Boobies.txt,Chandler,Yeah. I really do.,39
S01E13 The Boobies.txt,Chandler,Get off!,40
S01E13 The Boobies.txt,Ronni,Hi.,41

S01E13 The Boobies.txt,Rachel,Bathroom's up there.,41
S01E13 The Boobies.txt,Ronni,Great.,41
S01E13 The Boobies.txt,Rachel,"Hey, listen, Ronni, how long would you say Chandler's been in the shower?",41
S01E13 The Boobies.txt,Ronni,"Oh, like, uh, five minutes?",41
S01E13 The Boobies.txt,Rachel,Chandler Bing? It's time to see your thing.,43
S01E13 The Boobies.txt,Rachel,I thought it was Chandler!,45
S01E13 The Boobies.txt,Rachel,You were supposed to be in there so I could see your thing!,46
S01E13 The Boobies.txt,Chandler,"Sorry, my my thing was in there with me.",46
S01E13 The Boobies.txt,All,"Hey, Pheebs.",47
S01E13 The Boobies.txt,Phoebe,Hey.,47

S01E13 The Boobies.txt,Phoebe,Good. Oh oh! Roger's having a dinner thing and he wanted me to invite you guys.,47
S01E13 The Boobies.txt,Phoebe,So what's going on?,48
S01E13 The Boobies.txt,Monica,"Nothing, um, it's just, um... It's Roger.",48
S01E13 The Boobies.txt,Ross,"I dunno, there's just something about...",48
S01E13 The Boobies.txt,Chandler,Basically we just feel that he's...,48
S01E13 The Boobies.txt,Rachel,We hate that guy.,48
S01E13 The Boobies.txt,All,Yeah. Hate him.,48
S01E13 The Boobies.txt,Ross,"We're sorry, Pheebs, we're sorry.",48
S01E13 The Boobies.txt,Phoebe,"Uh-huh. Okay. Okay, don't you think, maybe, though, it's just that he's so perceptive that it freaks you out?",48
S01E13 The Boobies.txt,All,"...No, we hate him.",48
S01E13 The Boobies.txt,Rachel,We're sorry.,48
S01E13 The Boobies.txt,Joey,Ma! What're you doing here?,49
S01E13 The Boobies.txt,Joey,Oww! Big ring!,50
S01E13 The Boobies.txt,Joey,"Hold on, you-you knew?",51
S01E13 The Boobies.txt,Joey,"So then how could you I mean, how could you?!",51
S01E13 The Boobies.txt,Joey,"Ma, I don't mean to be disrespectful, but... what the hell are you talking about?! I mean, what about you?",51
S01E13 The Boobies.txt,Joey,I'm...happy...for you?,51
S01E13 The Boobies.txt,Joey,"Ma, I'm sorry. I just did what I thought you'd want.",51
S01E13 The Boobies.txt,Joey,Yeah. You're ten times prettier than she is.,51
S01E13 The Boobies.txt,Roger,"What's wrong, sweetie?",53
S01E13 The Boobies.txt,Phoebe,"Nothing, nothing.",53
S01E13 The Boobies.txt,Phoebe,"It's, I mean, it's nothing, I'm fine. It's my friends. They-they have a liking problem with you. In that, um, they don't.",54
S01E13 The Boobies.txt,Roger,Oh. They don't.,54
S01E13 The Boobies.txt,Phoebe,But they don't see all the wonderfulness that I see. They don't see all the good stuff and all the sweet stuff. They just think you're a little...,54
S01E13 The Boobies.txt,Roger,What?,54
S01E13 The Boobies.txt,Phoebe,Intense and creepy.,54
S01E13 The Boobies.txt,Roger,Oh.,54
S01E13 The Boobies.txt,Phoebe,"But I don't. Me, Phoebe.",54
S01E13 The Boobies.txt,Roger,"Well, I'm not I'm not at all surprised they feel that way.",54
S01E13 The Boobies.txt,Phoebe,"You're not? See, that's why you're so great!",54
S01E13 The Boobies.txt,Roger,"Actually it's, it's quite, y'know, typical behaviour when you have this kind of dysfunctional group dynamic. Y'know, this kind of co-dependant, emotionally stunted, sitting in your stupid coffee house with your stupid big cups which, I'm sorry, might as well have nipples on them, and you're like all 'Oh, define me! Define me! Love me, I need love!'.",54
S01E13 The Boobies.txt,Monica,"So you talked to your dad, huh.",55
S01E13 The Boobies.txt,Joey,"Yeah. He's gonna keep cheating on my ma like she wanted, she's gonna keep pretending she doesn't know even though she does, and my little sister Tina can't see her husband any more because he got a restraining order...which has nothing to do with anything except that I found out today.",55
S01E13 The Boobies.txt,Rachel,Wow.,55
S01E13 The Boobies.txt,Chandler,Things sure have changed here on Waltons mountain.,55
S01E13 The Boobies.txt,Ross,"So Joey, you okay?",55
S01E13 The Boobies.txt,Joey,"Yeah, I guess. It's just parents, after a certain point, you gotta let go. Even if you know better, you've gotta let them make their own mistakes.",55
S01E13 The Boobies.txt,Rachel,"Just think, in a couple of years we get to turn into them.",55
S01E13 The Boobies.txt,Chandler,"If I turn into my parents, I'll either be an alcoholic blond chasing after twenty-year-old boys, or... I'll end up like my mom.",55
S01E13 The Boobies.txt,All,"Hey, Pheebs.",56
S01E13 The Boobies.txt,Monica,How's it going?,56
S01E13 The Boobies.txt,Phoebe,"Oh, okay, except I broke up with Roger.",56
S01E13 The Boobies.txt,All,Awww.,56
S01E13 The Boobies.txt,Phoebe,"Yeah, right.",56
S01E13 The Boobies.txt,All,Aaawwwwww!!,56
S01E13 The Boobies.txt,Rachel,What happened?,56
S01E13 The Boobies.txt,Phoebe,"I don't know, I mean, he's a good person, and he can be really sweet, and in some ways I think he is so right for me, it's just... I hate that guy!",56
S01E13 The Boobies.txt,Phoebe,"Hey, Joey. What's going on?",57
S01E13 The Boobies.txt,Monica,Joey!! What the hell were you doing?!,58
S01E13 The Boobies.txt,Joey,Sorry. Wrong boobies.,58
S01E13 The Boobies.txt,Monica,"Hello, Joey.",59
S10E03 Rosss Tan.txt,Chandler,"So, you and Rachel tonight, huh?",2
S10E03 Rosss Tan.txt,Joey,Yeah. It's actually our first official date,2
S10E03 Rosss Tan.txt,Chandler,Wow! So tonight may be the night! You're nervous?,2
S10E03 Rosss Tan.txt,Joey,"Naa, no. This is the part I'm actually good at.",2
S10E03 Rosss Tan.txt,Chandler,What must it be like not to be crippled by fear and self-loathing.,2
S10E03 Rosss Tan.txt,Chandler,How can you be so confident?,3
S10E03 Rosss Tan.txt,Joey,"Well, I... I know exactly what I'm gonna do!",3
S10E03 Rosss Tan.txt,Chandler,Really? Like you have a routine?,3
S10E03 Rosss Tan.txt,Joey,"No, no no no no. See. Each woman is different.You have to appreciate their uniqueness.",3
S10E03 Rosss Tan.txt,Chandler,Really?,3
S10E03 Rosss Tan.txt,Joey,"No, I do six things! First, I look deep in her eyes. Then, I kiss her. Next I take my hand and I softly graze her thigh.",3
S10E03 Rosss Tan.txt,Joey,More foosball?,6
S10E03 Rosss Tan.txt,Chandler,...and beer!!,6
S10E03 Rosss Tan.txt,Chandler,Hey! Stop staring at my wife's legs! No no! Stop staring at your sister's legs!,10
S10E03 Rosss Tan.txt,Ross,"I'm sorry, it's just... how did you get so tan?",10
S10E03 Rosss Tan.txt,Chandler,She went on one of those spray-on tan places.,10
S10E03 Rosss Tan.txt,Ross,"Eh, you got a spray-on tan?",10
S10E03 Rosss Tan.txt,Monica,Chandler gets pedicures!,10
S10E03 Rosss Tan.txt,Ross,"Still, I can't believe that's sprayed on... I mean, it looks really good. I wonder if I should get one!",12
S10E03 Rosss Tan.txt,Chandler,"Sure, then you should get a mini skirt so you can really show it off.",12
S10E03 Rosss Tan.txt,Ross,"So, do you get colours or just French tips?",12
S10E03 Rosss Tan.txt,Monica,There. Here's their card.,12
S10E03 Rosss Tan.txt,Phoebe,Hey!,14
S10E03 Rosss Tan.txt,Chandler,Hey Pheebs!,14

S10E03 Rosss Tan.txt,Chandler,Who's Amanda?,14
S10E03 Rosss Tan.txt,Chandler,Are you trying to do a British accent?,15
S10E03 Rosss Tan.txt,Chandler,"Just so I know, how many more of those can I expect?",16
S10E03 Rosss Tan.txt,Monica,"I know, and she's always bragging about all the famous people she's met.",17
S10E03 Rosss Tan.txt,Phoebe,"Oh, I know! ""Oh...I slept with Billy Joel"". All right, who hasn't?",17
S10E03 Rosss Tan.txt,Monica,"Oh, what are we gonna do! I don't wanna see her!!",17
S10E03 Rosss Tan.txt,Phoebe,"Ugh, Let's just cut her out!",17
S10E03 Rosss Tan.txt,Monica,What?,17
S10E03 Rosss Tan.txt,Phoebe,Cut her out of our lives! Just ignore her calls and dodge her 'till she gets the point!,17
S10E03 Rosss Tan.txt,Chandler,"No, had it done to me though. Feels good !",18
S10E03 Rosss Tan.txt,Assistant,"Alright Mr. Geller! Right this way! So, how dark do you wanna be? We have one, two or three.",19

S10E03 Rosss Tan.txt,Ross,"Two, I think a two.",19
S10E03 Rosss Tan.txt,Assistant,"You've got to face the red light. When the red light goes on the spraying is about to start so close your eyes. When the spraying stops, count to five. Pat yourself down to avoid drip marks then turn around so we can get your back. Got it?",19
S10E03 Rosss Tan.txt,Ross,"Spray, count, pat, then turn, spray, count and pat.",19
S10E03 Rosss Tan.txt,Assistant,"Wow, you catch on quick.",19
S10E03 Rosss Tan.txt,Ross,You sprayed my front twice!,22
S10E03 Rosss Tan.txt,Assistant,You've never turned?,22

S10E03 Rosss Tan.txt,Phoebe,"Oh, yeah. Could be Rachel asking if someone could baby-sit again.",37
S10E03 Rosss Tan.txt,Monica,It could be Amanda!,37

S10E03 Rosss Tan.txt,Amanda,Hello Monica. It’s Amanda calling again. I am in the neighborhood hoping I can pop by your flat!,38
S10E03 Rosss Tan.txt,Monica,You're from Yonkers! Your last name is Buffo-Martisis!,38

S10E03 Rosss Tan.txt,Monica,"Well, I said 'no' to her coming over now! I couldn’t say 'no' twice! I get this uncontrollable need to please people!",42

S10E03 Rosss Tan.txt,Rachel,"Ok well, well I'm really, I'm sorry about that Joey, but do you think that maybe on some level, you don't want to take off my bra?",48
S10E03 Rosss Tan.txt,Chandler,Hold on! There is something different.,51
S10E03 Rosss Tan.txt,Ross,I went to that tanning place your wife suggested.,51

S10E03 Rosss Tan.txt,Rachel,oh oh! What is up with Miss Hawaiian Tropic?,56
S10E03 Rosss Tan.txt,Chandler,How was your date with Joey?,56
S10E03 Rosss Tan.txt,Rachel,"Well, it was good.. until we got back to our apartment, and then we were fooling around and he started to put his hand up my leg and I kept slapping it away!",56
S10E03 Rosss Tan.txt,Chandler,You didn't like that?,56
S10E03 Rosss Tan.txt,Rachel,"Well, it wasn't just me, alright? He freaked out too! He couldn't even undo my bra!",56
S10E03 Rosss Tan.txt,Monica,"Wow, really? One time he just looked at my bra and it popped open.",56
S10E03 Rosss Tan.txt,Rachel,"I do not know what's wrong with us, I mean, we have kissed before and that's been great! But this time it was leading somewhere and I was very aware of the fact that it was Joey touching me.",57
S10E03 Rosss Tan.txt,Monica,"Well, you guys have been friends forever. Remember the first time that you kissed Ross? How weird that was? You couldn't stop laughing? You got through that.",57

S10E03 Rosss Tan.txt,Phoebe,"Oh! Well, what kind of emergency that gets us both out of here?",67
S10E03 Rosss Tan.txt,Monica,"Well, what do you think of Mike and Chandler being in a car accident?",67
S10E03 Rosss Tan.txt,Phoebe,Hi!,69
S10E03 Rosss Tan.txt,Monica,Hi!,69
S10E03 Rosss Tan.txt,Phoebe,Musty!,76
S10E03 Rosss Tan.txt,Amanda,"Oh! Gosh! This is brilliant. Gosh, it's just like old times. I'm so happy you two are friends again!",76
S10E03 Rosss Tan.txt,Monica,When were we not friends?,76

S10E03 Rosss Tan.txt,Rachel,What? Oh my God! I'm so sorry. Joey? Are you ok?,91
S10E03 Rosss Tan.txt,Monica,We are not friends with Phoebe anymore.,94
S10E03 Rosss Tan.txt,Chandler,"If she asks, I protested a little, but ok!",94
S10E03 Rosss Tan.txt,Phoebe,"Oh Chandler! Thank God you're alive. Monica, can I talk to you outside for a minute?",95
S10E03 Rosss Tan.txt,Monica,I have nothing to say to you.,95
S10E03 Rosss Tan.txt,Phoebe,"Please, Monica? In the hall?",96
S10E03 Rosss Tan.txt,Amanda,"Ooh, that accident must have been terrible. You look positively ghastly.",97
S10E03 Rosss Tan.txt,Chandler,"Well, aren't you a treat.",97
S10E03 Rosss Tan.txt,Monica,"I can't believe you tried to cut me out. Why Phoebe, why?",98
S10E03 Rosss Tan.txt,Phoebe,"It was right after we were living together and you were driving me crazy, okay? You were really controlling and compulsive and shrill.",98
S10E03 Rosss Tan.txt,Monica,I'm still all those things!,98
S10E03 Rosss Tan.txt,Phoebe,You're also so generous and kind and scrappy!,98
S10E03 Rosss Tan.txt,Phoebe,"Exactly! Look, no matter what I tried to do, I couldn't keep you out of my life. Of all the people I have cut out, you were the only one who ever clawed her way back in.",99
S10E03 Rosss Tan.txt,Monica,It's because I'm scrappy.,99
S10E03 Rosss Tan.txt,Phoebe,"Yeah, you are. And I'm so glad that you fought your way back in, because I don't know what I would do without you.",99
S10E03 Rosss Tan.txt,Monica,I won't know what I would do without you.,99
S10E03 Rosss Tan.txt,Monica,"Well, I guess we should go back in. When you gave me another chance, I guess we should do the same for Amanda.",100
S10E03 Rosss Tan.txt,Phoebe,"Yeah, I guess you're right.",100
S10E03 Rosss Tan.txt,Amanda,Can you believe it. I've never had any professional dance training.,101
S10E03 Rosss Tan.txt,Glenda,"Now, let me explain how this works. You go into the booth, and...",104
S10E03 Rosss Tan.txt,Ross,"I'm gonna stop you right there, Glenda. Okay? Does it look like this is my first time, huh? Now I want 4 two's... and I want them all on my back.",104
S10E03 Rosss Tan.txt,Ross,"Wait a minute, there's two sets of nozzles, which one is it?",106
S10E03 Rosss Tan.txt,Ross,Which... which... which... Which one is it?,107
S10E03 Rosss Tan.txt,Ross,OH! SON OF A BITCH!,108
S10E03 Rosss Tan.txt,Rachel,What is the matter with us?,111
S10E03 Rosss Tan.txt,Joey,"Well, I know what's the matter with me.",111
S10E03 Rosss Tan.txt,Rachel,"No, I mean with us, you know. I mean, is it supposed to be this... difficult?",111
S10E03 Rosss Tan.txt,Joey,I don't know.,111
S10E03 Rosss Tan.txt,Chandler,"That fake British woman is a real bitch, but she sure can dance... Hey!",112
S10E03 Rosss Tan.txt,Rachel,"Hi! Hey, listen, can we ask you a question? When you and Monica first hooked up, was it weird going from friends to... more than that?",112
S10E03 Rosss Tan.txt,Chandler,"Kinda... you know, sneaking around, having to hide from you guys...",112
S10E03 Rosss Tan.txt,Rachel,"No, no, no... No, I mean... se-x-u-ally...",112
S10E03 Rosss Tan.txt,Joey,"Yeah, was there a part of you that... felt like it was... really wrong?",112
S10E03 Rosss Tan.txt,Chandler,"Actually, no. No, it felt right. You know, it felt like uhm... I can't believe we haven't been doing this the whole time.",112
S10E03 Rosss Tan.txt,Rachel,"Well, just because it happened that way for them doesn't mean it has to happen that way for us.",114
S10E03 Rosss Tan.txt,Joey,"Yeah, yeah... Absolutely. I mean, just because something's difficult doesn't mean that you quit.",114
S10E03 Rosss Tan.txt,Rachel,"Right, totally.",114
S10E03 Rosss Tan.txt,Joey,"Yeah, so we just keep trying and trying until we... do it.",114
S10E03 Rosss Tan.txt,Rachel,"Yeah, and if doesn't work, then we'll be just one of those couples that never have sex.",114
S10E03 Rosss Tan.txt,Joey,That's a... pla-an.,114
S10E03 Rosss Tan.txt,Rachel,I know.,116
S10E03 Rosss Tan.txt,Joey,"I don't get it. I mean, I was so sure this was what I wanted.",116
S10E03 Rosss Tan.txt,Rachel,Hmmm... Me too...,116
S10E03 Rosss Tan.txt,Rachel,I wonder how Monica and Chandler could do it?,117
S10E03 Rosss Tan.txt,Joey,I guess they weren't as good friends as we are.,117
S10E03 Rosss Tan.txt,Rachel,Aah... I bet you're right.,118
S10E03 Rosss Tan.txt,Joey,So...,119

S10E03 Rosss Tan.txt,Chandler,"Dude, it's Chandler. Let me in.",123
S10E03 Rosss Tan.txt,Ross,Go away! I don't want to see anybody.,124
S10E03 Rosss Tan.txt,Chandler,"I know, I went to the tanning place and the same thing happened to me. You have to let me in.",124
S10E03 Rosss Tan.txt,Ross,Really? Did you count Mississipily?,124
S10E03 Rosss Tan.txt,Ross,"Dude, you're not tanned.",125
S10E03 Rosss Tan.txt,Chandler,"No, I just had to get a picture of this.",125
S10E03 Rosss Tan.txt,Chandler,I see you later!,126
S07E06 The Nap Partners.txt,Monica,"Okay, the reason why I asked you guys out to brunch today is because I have been doing some thinking about who should be my maid of honor.",2
S07E06 The Nap Partners.txt,Phoebe,I hope it’s you.,3
S07E06 The Nap Partners.txt,Rachel,Me too!,3
S07E06 The Nap Partners.txt,Monica,"First of all um, I love you both so much and you’re both so important to me…",3
S07E06 The Nap Partners.txt,Rachel,"Okay, bla-bla-bla-bla!! Who is it?!",3
S07E06 The Nap Partners.txt,Monica,"Well umm, I was thinking that maybe we could come up with a system where we trade of being maid of honor for each other. Like hypothetically, if Phoebe were mine…",3
S07E06 The Nap Partners.txt,Phoebe,Yes!!! Oh!!,3
S07E06 The Nap Partners.txt,Rachel,Hypothetically!,3
S07E06 The Nap Partners.txt,Phoebe,Still.,3
S07E06 The Nap Partners.txt,Monica,If Phoebe were my maid of honor…,3
S07E06 The Nap Partners.txt,Rachel,Uh-hmm.,3
S07E06 The Nap Partners.txt,Monica,"Rachel would be Phoebe’s, I would be Rachel’s, that way we all get to do it once and no one would get upset.",3
S07E06 The Nap Partners.txt,Rachel,Yeah that’s actually a pretty good idea.,3
S07E06 The Nap Partners.txt,Phoebe,"Yeah, I’ll do that. So who gets to be yours?",3
S07E06 The Nap Partners.txt,Phoebe,Wh-why is that the best part?,4
S07E06 The Nap Partners.txt,Monica,Because then I don’t have to!,4
S07E06 The Nap Partners.txt,Monica,I’m really not deciding!,5
S07E06 The Nap Partners.txt,Rachel,Fine!,5
S07E06 The Nap Partners.txt,Woman,"Excuse me, I-I couldn’t help overhearing, you’re marrying Chandler Bing?",6

S07E06 The Nap Partners.txt,Phoebe,But why does it even matter?!,11
S07E06 The Nap Partners.txt,Rachel,Why does it matter so much to you?!,11
S07E06 The Nap Partners.txt,Phoebe,Because this one is now! And-and it’s two of our best friends! Who knows what you’re gonna marry!,11
S07E06 The Nap Partners.txt,Rachel,What-what if I marry Ross—Or Joey?,11

S07E06 The Nap Partners.txt,Joey,"Hey-hey-hey-hey, I can help you decide who should do it! Yeah, we could have like uh, like an audition and see how you’d handle maid of honor type situations.",26
S07E06 The Nap Partners.txt,Phoebe,What are you talking about?,26
S07E06 The Nap Partners.txt,Joey,"Like when I want a job, I go to an audition and if I’m the best of the people they see, they give me the part.",26
S07E06 The Nap Partners.txt,Phoebe,"Okay, so after this audition, who decides who gets it?",26
S07E06 The Nap Partners.txt,Joey,"Oh uh, me and Ross can be the judges.",26
S07E06 The Nap Partners.txt,Rachel,"Oh, come on! This is crazy! Can’t we just flip a coin?!",27
S07E06 The Nap Partners.txt,Phoebe,No! Coins hate me!,27
S07E06 The Nap Partners.txt,Ross,"Wow, this cologne really is every bit as good as Georgio.",29

S07E06 The Nap Partners.txt,Ross,I… I don’t know what you are talking about.,29
S07E06 The Nap Partners.txt,Joey,Come on! Admit it! That was the best nap you ever had!,29
S07E06 The Nap Partners.txt,Ross,I’ve had better.,29
S07E06 The Nap Partners.txt,Joey,Okay! When?!,29

S07E06 The Nap Partners.txt,Joey,I want to do it again.,29
S07E06 The Nap Partners.txt,Ross,We can’t do it again.,29
S07E06 The Nap Partners.txt,Joey,Why not?,29
S07E06 The Nap Partners.txt,Ross,Because it’s weird!,29
S07E06 The Nap Partners.txt,Joey,Fine! Do you want something to drink?,29
S07E06 The Nap Partners.txt,Ross,"Sure, what do you got?",29
S07E06 The Nap Partners.txt,Chandler,Can you figure out what I’m doing?,32
S07E06 The Nap Partners.txt,Monica,You’re Lewis Posin.,32
S07E06 The Nap Partners.txt,Chandler,Who?,32
S07E06 The Nap Partners.txt,Monica,"Lewis Posin! He was my best friend in fifth grade, and-and then one day I asked him to be my boyfriend and he said no. Do you know why?",32
S07E06 The Nap Partners.txt,Chandler,Because you kept talking to him while he was trying to go to the bathroom?!,32
S07E06 The Nap Partners.txt,Chandler,What? Are you kidding? That was like 16 years ago.,33
S07E06 The Nap Partners.txt,Monica,"No, I know. But y’know what? It would make me feel better if Lewis apologized to me.",33
S07E06 The Nap Partners.txt,Chandler,"Okay, I will do it. But I have to warn you; this may make me a better person and that is not the man you feel in love with!",33
S07E06 The Nap Partners.txt,Joey,"Okay, all right, this is how it’s going to work. We’re gonna give you hypothetical maid of honor situations and you will be scored on a scale of 1 to 10, 1 being the highest.",34
S07E06 The Nap Partners.txt,Ross,"No, 10 is the highest.",34
S07E06 The Nap Partners.txt,Joey,Why is 10 the highest?,34
S07E06 The Nap Partners.txt,Rachel,"Okay, uh…",36
S07E06 The Nap Partners.txt,Joey,I’ve got cold feet.,36
S07E06 The Nap Partners.txt,Rachel,…it’s gonna be okay!,36
S07E06 The Nap Partners.txt,Joey,"No, one man for the rest of my life? I don’t know if I can do it! This means I’ll never get to sleep with Joey!",36
S07E06 The Nap Partners.txt,Rachel,"Look Monica, getting cold feet is very common. Y’know, it’s-it’s just because of all the anticipation and you just have to remember that you love Chandler. And also, I ran out on a wedding. You don’t get to keep the gifts.",36
S07E06 The Nap Partners.txt,Rachel,Thanks!,37
S07E06 The Nap Partners.txt,Ross,"Yes, very nice Rachel.",37
S07E06 The Nap Partners.txt,Rachel,Thank you judges.,37
S07E06 The Nap Partners.txt,Phoebe,"Ugh, what a kiss ass.",37
S07E06 The Nap Partners.txt,Rachel,Oh!,37
S07E06 The Nap Partners.txt,Joey,"Okay, Phoebe…",37
S07E06 The Nap Partners.txt,Phoebe,Yes! Your honor?,37
S07E06 The Nap Partners.txt,Joey,"We’re now in the ceremony, Monica is about to say, ""I do"" when her drunk uncle starts yelling. What do you do? Go!",37
S07E06 The Nap Partners.txt,Phoebe,Oh!,38
S07E06 The Nap Partners.txt,Joey,Yes! Excellent! Perfect score!,38
S07E06 The Nap Partners.txt,Rachel,Wait a minute! She just made a scene in the middle of the ceremony!,38
S07E06 The Nap Partners.txt,Phoebe,Hey! Do you want do you want a little taste of Pheebs?!,38
S07E06 The Nap Partners.txt,Ross,It is time for you to give your maid of honor speech.,38
S07E06 The Nap Partners.txt,Rachel,"Ohh, wait a minute, we haven’t pre…",38
S07E06 The Nap Partners.txt,Ross,Go!,38
S07E06 The Nap Partners.txt,Ross,"Yeah, it really was!",41
S07E06 The Nap Partners.txt,Rachel,"Aw, thanks!",41
S07E06 The Nap Partners.txt,Joey,Yeah.,42
S07E06 The Nap Partners.txt,Joey,And she’s back in the game.,44
S07E06 The Nap Partners.txt,Julie,Hello Skidmark.,46
S07E06 The Nap Partners.txt,Monica,It’s pretty clear.,47
S07E06 The Nap Partners.txt,Chandler,"Ah, uh, I owe you a long overdue apology. I never should have broken up with you because you were overweight.",47
S07E06 The Nap Partners.txt,Julie,That’s why you broke up with me?,47
S07E06 The Nap Partners.txt,Joey,"All right, well first of all I would like to say that you both performed very well. Okay? You should be proud of yourselves. And-and I would also like to say that in this competition there are no losers. Well, except for Rachel—Damnit!",49
S07E06 The Nap Partners.txt,Phoebe,Really?! I won!,49
S07E06 The Nap Partners.txt,Rachel,What?!,49
S07E06 The Nap Partners.txt,Ross,"I’m sorry Rach, it was, it was really close.",49
S07E06 The Nap Partners.txt,Ross,"Actually, it wasn’t that close.",50
S07E06 The Nap Partners.txt,Phoebe,The coins have finally forgiven me!,51
S07E06 The Nap Partners.txt,Joey,"Boy I tell ya, that judging stuff took a lot out of me.",53
S07E06 The Nap Partners.txt,Ross,Yeah?,53
S07E06 The Nap Partners.txt,Ross,Why-why would I care about that?,54
S07E06 The Nap Partners.txt,Joey,"No reason, I’m just saying that uh… That’s where I’ll be.",54
S07E06 The Nap Partners.txt,Chandler,As bad as that went I actually enjoyed myself. I think that I’m going to apologize for all of the stupid things I do.,56
S07E06 The Nap Partners.txt,Monica,Why don’t you just stop doing stupid things? Then you wouldn’t have to apologize.,56
S07E06 The Nap Partners.txt,Chandler,I would really love it if could do both.,56
S07E06 The Nap Partners.txt,Monica,"All right, I…I have to ask.",56
S07E06 The Nap Partners.txt,Chandler,What?,56

S01E06 The Butt.txt,Aurora,"...Luckily none of the bullets hit the engine block. So, we made it to the border, but just barely, and I- ...I've been talking about myself all night long, I'm sorry. What about you? Tell me one of your stories.",20

S01E06 The Butt.txt,Chandler,"Well, y'know, I had some trouble with it at first too, but the way I look at it is, I get all the good stuff: all the fun, all the talking, all the sex; and none of the responsibility. I mean, this is every guy's fantasy!",20
S01E06 The Butt.txt,Phoebe,"Oh, yeah. That is not true. Ross, is this your fantasy?",20
S01E06 The Butt.txt,Monica,What? So you guys don't mind going out with someone else who's going out with someone else?,21
S01E06 The Butt.txt,Joey,I couldn't do it.,21
S01E06 The Butt.txt,Monica,"Good for you, Joey.",21
S01E06 The Butt.txt,Joey,"When I'm with a woman, I need to know that I'm going out with more people than she is.",21
S01E06 The Butt.txt,Ross,"Well, y'know, monogamy can be a, uh, tricky concept. I mean, anthropologically speaking-",21
S01E06 The Butt.txt,Ross,"Fine. Fine, alright, now you'll never know.",22
S01E06 The Butt.txt,Monica,"We're kidding. C'mon, tell us!",22

S01E06 The Butt.txt,Monica,"You guys, I am not that bad!",26
S01E06 The Butt.txt,Monica,That is so unfair!,27
S01E06 The Butt.txt,Ross,"Oh c'mon! When we were kids, yours was the only Raggedy Ann doll that wasn't raggedy!",27
S01E06 The Butt.txt,Monica,"Okay, so I'm responsible, I'm organised. But hey, I can be a kook.",27
S01E06 The Butt.txt,Ross,"Alright, you madcap gal. Try to imagine this. The phone bill arrives, but you don't pay it right away.",27
S01E06 The Butt.txt,Monica,Why not?,27
S01E06 The Butt.txt,Ross,Because you're a kook! Instead you wait until they send you a notice.,27
S01E06 The Butt.txt,Monica,I could do that.,27
S01E06 The Butt.txt,Rachel,"Okay, uh, you let me go grocery shopping, and I buy laundry detergent, but it's not the one with the easy-pour spout.",27
S01E06 The Butt.txt,Monica,Why would someone do that?! ...One might wonder.,27
S01E06 The Butt.txt,Chandler,"Someone's left a glass on the coffee table. There's no coaster. It's a cold drink, it's a hot day. Little beads of condensation are inching their way closer and closer to the surface of the wood...",27
S01E06 The Butt.txt,Monica,STOP IT!! ...Oh my God. It's true! Who am I?,27
S01E06 The Butt.txt,Ross,Monica? You're Mom.,27

S01E06 The Butt.txt,Joey,"Okay, okay, fine! Make jokes, I don't care! This is a big break for me!",32
S01E06 The Butt.txt,Ross,"You're right, you're right, it is...So you gonna invite us all to the big opening?",32

S01E06 The Butt.txt,Monica,He's in the bathroom. I don't think you wanna go in there!,36
S01E06 The Butt.txt,Monica,I warned you...,37
S01E06 The Butt.txt,Rachel,Who is being loud?,38

S01E06 The Butt.txt,Aurora,"Why can't we just have what we have now? Why can't we just talk, and laugh, and make love, without feeling obligated to one another... and up until tonight I thought that's what you wanted too.",51
S01E06 The Butt.txt,Chandler,"...Well, y'know, part of me wants that, but it's like I'm two guys, y'know? I mean, one guy's going 'Shut up! This is great!' But there's this other guy. Actually it's the same guy that wells up every time that Grinch's heart grows three sizes and breaks that measuring device... And he's saying, y'know, 'This is too hard! Get out! Get out!'",51
S01E06 The Butt.txt,Aurora,So... which one of the two guys will you listen to?,51

S01E06 The Butt.txt,Joey,Nope.,56
S01E06 The Butt.txt,Ross,"No? What happened, big guy?",56
S01E06 The Butt.txt,Ross,It felt like a 'big guy' moment.,57
S01E06 The Butt.txt,Joey,I got fired.,57
S01E06 The Butt.txt,All,Oh!,57
S01E06 The Butt.txt,Joey,"Yeah, they said I acted too much with it. I told everybody about this! Now everybody's gonna go to the theatre, expecting to see me, and...",57
S01E06 The Butt.txt,Rachel,"Oh, Joey, you know what, no-one is gonna be able to tell.",57
S01E06 The Butt.txt,Joey,My mom will.,57
S01E06 The Butt.txt,Chandler,Something so sweet and...disturbing about that.,57
S01E06 The Butt.txt,Joey,"Y'know, I've done nothing but crappy plays for six years. And I finally get my shot, and I blow it!",57
S01E06 The Butt.txt,Monica,Maybe this wasn't your shot.,57

S01E06 The Butt.txt,Phoebe,"No, I don't think this was your shot. I mean, I don't even think you just get one shot. I really believe big things are gonna happen for you, I do! You've gotta just keep thinking about the day that some kid is gonna run up to his friends and go 'I got the part! I got the part! I'm gonna be Joey Tribbiani's ass!'.",57
S01E06 The Butt.txt,Monica,"I'm sorry, Joey. I'm gonna go to bed, guys.",59

S07E15 Joeys New Brain.txt,Phoebe,"Ohh, he left his cell phone.",17
S07E15 Joeys New Brain.txt,Rachel,"Oh, well, we can hand it to Gunther and he'll put it in lost and found.",17
S07E15 Joeys New Brain.txt,Phoebe,Or we could use it to call China. See how those guys are doing.,17
S07E15 Joeys New Brain.txt,Rachel,"What if, um, if he calls his own cell phone to find out who found it and I answer and we start talking and we fell in love. I mean wouldn't that be a great story? Kind of like a fairy tale for the digital age.",17
S07E15 Joeys New Brain.txt,Rachel,What? Wait! Why…why do you get the story?,18
S07E15 Joeys New Brain.txt,Phoebe,I don't know. I haven't been out on a date in so long.,18

S07E15 Joeys New Brain.txt,Phoebe,Ah-ha! Too cocky!,23
S07E15 Joeys New Brain.txt,Dina,"I’m going to keep dating him Mother, and there’s nothing you can do about it!",24
S07E15 Joeys New Brain.txt,Dina,What are you going to do? Kill him? Like you did with Charles?!,24
S07E15 Joeys New Brain.txt,Joey,That was a great scene! And-and-and that slap looks so real! How do you do that?,28

S07E15 Joeys New Brain.txt,Cecilia,Y’know what? It doesn’t matter! Because it is not true!,31
S07E15 Joeys New Brain.txt,Joey,Okay.,31
S07E15 Joeys New Brain.txt,Rachel,"No Phoebe! You cannot get the phone that way; that’s not fair! Okay look, I have an idea. Why don’t we, why don’t we see what kind of number he has on his speed dial, and then from that we can tell who has more in common with him. And then whoever does gets the phone.",34
S07E15 Joeys New Brain.txt,Phoebe,"Or, we can decide by whose ever name is closer to the word phone.",34
S07E15 Joeys New Brain.txt,Rachel,I don’t think so.,34
S07E15 Joeys New Brain.txt,Phoebe,"Ohh, I lost my mom to suicide.",36
S07E15 Joeys New Brain.txt,Rachel,"Okay no way, you cannot use that to get the cute guy and the last blueberry muffin.",36
S07E15 Joeys New Brain.txt,Phoebe,Did I use that already today? I’m sorry.,36
S07E15 Joeys New Brain.txt,Phoebe,"Okay, a meat eater. Fine, that’s one for you.",37
S07E15 Joeys New Brain.txt,Phoebe,"So you don’t know that’s Barney’s the store! That can be y’know his friend’s house, or a bar. Who has Barney’s the store on their speed dial?",38

S07E15 Joeys New Brain.txt,Monica,It sounds like it’s coming from across the street.,40
S07E15 Joeys New Brain.txt,Monica,What?,41
S07E15 Joeys New Brain.txt,Chandler,"Y’know that thing that Ross was gonna do at our wedding?! He was hanging out with me yesterday and he turned to me and said, ""You’re half Scottish right?""",41

S07E15 Joeys New Brain.txt,Cecilia,"Yeah, thanks.",56
S07E15 Joeys New Brain.txt,Joey,No I mean it! I can’t believe they would do this to you! And to your fans! I mean they are going to be devastated! Heart broken! They love you so much!,56
S07E15 Joeys New Brain.txt,Cecilia,Oh you’re right. Thank you! What’s your name again?,56
S07E15 Joeys New Brain.txt,Joey,Joey.,56
S07E15 Joeys New Brain.txt,Joey,"Uh yeah-ye-ye-ye-ye-ye—l-l-l-l-l-look the-the-the only reason that I, that I came up to you before was because well, I’m really nervous about-about being you. Y’know if you can help me capture the essence of the character. Y’know? Help me keep Jessica alive. Please?",58
S07E15 Joeys New Brain.txt,Cecilia,"All right Joey, I will help you. Not because I-I owe it to this stupid show, but because I owe it to Jessica.",58

S07E15 Joeys New Brain.txt,Cecilia,You’re so welcome.,58

S07E15 Joeys New Brain.txt,Cecilia,Yeah but Jessica doesn’t have an English accent.,59
S07E15 Joeys New Brain.txt,Chandler,"Well, I feel like a snack!",61
S07E15 Joeys New Brain.txt,Monica,Do you want some shortbread? Eh that’s Scottish like you are.,61
S07E15 Joeys New Brain.txt,Chandler,Oh no thanks. I don’t like any thing from my Scottish heritage.,61
S07E15 Joeys New Brain.txt,Ross,What?!,61
S07E15 Joeys New Brain.txt,Ross,"Oh well, it sounds to me like your family is ready to uh, rediscover its Scottish roots.",62
S07E15 Joeys New Brain.txt,Monica,No! No-no they’re not. They’re still very angry! But y’know Chandler is also half-Swedish. You know what the Swedish people are famous for? Sitting down and being quiet.,62
S07E15 Joeys New Brain.txt,Ross,Well yeah-yeah the Scottish history is so much more…,62
S07E15 Joeys New Brain.txt,Ross,How did you know about that?!,63
S07E15 Joeys New Brain.txt,Chandler,We heard you play all the way from your apartment!,63
S07E15 Joeys New Brain.txt,Ross,Were you the ones called the cops?!,63
S07E15 Joeys New Brain.txt,Chandler,"That’s not really important right now. What is important is; while we appreciate the gesture, we just don’t feel bagpipes are appropriate for our wedding.",63
S07E15 Joeys New Brain.txt,Ross,Why not?,63
S07E15 Joeys New Brain.txt,Chandler,Because we hate them.,63
S07E15 Joeys New Brain.txt,Ross,Come on that’s not fair! I mean you haven’t even heard me play!,63
S07E15 Joeys New Brain.txt,Chandler,We have heard you play.,63
S07E15 Joeys New Brain.txt,Ross,"No, you’ve heard my practice. Okay? Just-just give me a chance to perform for you and then decide whatever you want. And I’m not going to tell you what song I’m gonna play either. But uh, let’s just say when it’s over I’ll bet there will be a we bit o’ celebration.",63
S07E15 Joeys New Brain.txt,Cecilia,"No, he already knows that he owns everything in the room! He’s not finding it out for the first time! So, try it again.",66
S07E15 Joeys New Brain.txt,Joey,"Oh well—Hey-hey! Maybe, maybe uh, maybe this is a good thing. Y’know? It’ll-it’ll give you a chance to shake things up, play different characters. You’re so talented.",68
S07E15 Joeys New Brain.txt,Cecilia,"I am. I am, but I don’t know you know. An actor of a certain age is not that easy.",68
S07E15 Joeys New Brain.txt,Joey,"Hey that’s not true! Look at uh, look at Angela Lansb—Angelina Jolie!",68
S07E15 Joeys New Brain.txt,Cecilia,"I probably should’ve just left years ago when the offers were pouring in, but y’know I just got so comfy here! And… Ohh, I turned down some amazing work!",68
S07E15 Joeys New Brain.txt,Joey,Like-like what?,68
S07E15 Joeys New Brain.txt,Cecilia,"Well, let’s just say if I left 15 years ago, the landscape of Mexican cinema would be very different today!",68
S07E15 Joeys New Brain.txt,Joey,"Yeah-yeah, I noticed that! Is that ‘cause she’s so passionate?",74
S07E15 Joeys New Brain.txt,Rachel,Hey! Hey!,78

S10E16 Rachels Going Away Party.txt,Rachel,"I know... Honey, seriously, I did it all. The luggage that I'm taking is in the bedroom, this is Emma's Paris stuff, these are the boxes that I'm having shipped, and that's the sandwich that I made for the plane...",4
S10E16 Rachels Going Away Party.txt,Chandler,Where's your passport?,7

S10E16 Rachels Going Away Party.txt,Ross,Hotel? Why isn't she staying with you guys?,16
S10E16 Rachels Going Away Party.txt,Monica,Because we're moving in a couple of days and it just didn't make sense.,16
S10E16 Rachels Going Away Party.txt,Erica,Plus hotels are fun! My room has this little fridge full of free snacks!,16

S10E16 Rachels Going Away Party.txt,Chandler,I didn't know Monica had these!,25
S10E16 Rachels Going Away Party.txt,Joey,"Mhm, maybe she used them with another boyfriend. Maybe Richard!",25
S10E16 Rachels Going Away Party.txt,Chandler,Why would she use them with Richard and not me? I can be kinky! I once did a naked dance for her... with scarves!,25

S10E16 Rachels Going Away Party.txt,Monica,"Well, I thought this would be a great opportunity to use up all the food that I don't want to move to the new house with me! So, enjoy: smoke oyster casserole with a breakfast cereal crust, kidney beans in their own juices, and for dessert, a questionable orange.",27
S10E16 Rachels Going Away Party.txt,Chandler,Hey.,28
S10E16 Rachels Going Away Party.txt,Ross,"Hey, where's Rach?",28

S10E16 Rachels Going Away Party.txt,Rachel,I'm gonna miss you so much.,34
S10E16 Rachels Going Away Party.txt,Phoebe,I know.,34
S10E16 Rachels Going Away Party.txt,Ross,"Hey, what do you think they're doing in there?",35
S10E16 Rachels Going Away Party.txt,Joey,"Huh, if I had to guess I'd say Rachel is putting on the bubble wrap and Phoebe is doing the punching.",35
S10E16 Rachels Going Away Party.txt,Rachel,"Oh, Pheebs, I don't even know where to start.",36
S10E16 Rachels Going Away Party.txt,Phoebe,"It's a cotton swab with a bit of my saliva on it, so that if they perfect the cloning process while you are over there, you can use the DNA to create your own Pheebs!",38
S10E16 Rachels Going Away Party.txt,Rachel,"I'm gonna throw this away, but thank you so much for the gesture!",38
S10E16 Rachels Going Away Party.txt,Chandler,"Oh, yes. I decided to leave these out for you in case Richard stops by and you wanna engage on a little light bondage and moustache play!",40
S10E16 Rachels Going Away Party.txt,Monica,What are you talking about? These aren't mine.,40
S10E16 Rachels Going Away Party.txt,Chandler,"Oh yeah, right! Good luck getting another scarf dance from me!",40
S10E16 Rachels Going Away Party.txt,Monica,"That would be a terrible punishment. But, I'm serious, I've never seen these before.",40
S10E16 Rachels Going Away Party.txt,Chandler,Really? Then what are they doing in our guestroom?,40
S10E16 Rachels Going Away Party.txt,Monica,Rachel used to live in that room.,40
S10E16 Rachels Going Away Party.txt,Monica,Joey's bare ass!,41
S10E16 Rachels Going Away Party.txt,Rachel,I love you Phoebe.,43
S10E16 Rachels Going Away Party.txt,Rachel,"All right. Well, if I gonna do this, I'd better keep going.",44
S10E16 Rachels Going Away Party.txt,Phoebe,Ok.,44
S10E16 Rachels Going Away Party.txt,Rachel,Ok. Monica?,44
S10E16 Rachels Going Away Party.txt,Monica,Yeah?,44
S10E16 Rachels Going Away Party.txt,Rachel,Can you come here with me for a minute?,44

S10E16 Rachels Going Away Party.txt,Monica,No.,45
S10E16 Rachels Going Away Party.txt,Phoebe,She's gonna say goodbye to each of us individually.,47
S10E16 Rachels Going Away Party.txt,Ross,Are you kidding? Oh my God...,47
S10E16 Rachels Going Away Party.txt,Phoebe,"Yeah, I know, it's gonna be even worse for you... God... Ross, get ready to do some serious crying.",47
S10E16 Rachels Going Away Party.txt,Rachel,"Mon... Okay... I've gotta... just say what it is I'm gonna say... None of the amazing things that have happened to me in the last ten years, would have happened if it wasn't for you. No-one has been more like a sister to me...",49
S10E16 Rachels Going Away Party.txt,Monica,I know what you mean. You're like a sister to me too.,49
S10E16 Rachels Going Away Party.txt,Monica,What?,52
S10E16 Rachels Going Away Party.txt,Chandler,"Uh, Rach?",56
S10E16 Rachels Going Away Party.txt,Ross,Well it's okay. Chandler is talking to her.,56
S10E16 Rachels Going Away Party.txt,Joey,I really made you think about that thing uh?,56
S10E16 Rachels Going Away Party.txt,Chandler,"No, no, no... They're really yours. We... found them in your old room.",58
S10E16 Rachels Going Away Party.txt,Rachel,"Well, these aren't mine. Maybe Monica used to use them with...",58
S10E16 Rachels Going Away Party.txt,Chandler,"Don't say Richard! Well, if they're not Monica's and they're not yours, then whose are they?",58
S10E16 Rachels Going Away Party.txt,Rachel,"Well, I think you're forgetting the kinkiest former resident of that room.",58
S10E16 Rachels Going Away Party.txt,Chandler,Pheebs!,58
S10E16 Rachels Going Away Party.txt,Chandler,I think these are yours.,59
S10E16 Rachels Going Away Party.txt,Phoebe,"These are not mine... Look how flimsy they are, come on! Good God! You try to hang a guy from a waterpipe with these, they'll snap like a piece of licorice.",59
S10E16 Rachels Going Away Party.txt,Rachel,Oh honey...,63
S10E16 Rachels Going Away Party.txt,Chandler,"Let me just say something... Because once we get into this, I'm gonna get all uncomfortable and probably make some stupid joke... I just want to say that I... I love you... And, I'm gonna miss you. And I'm so sad that you're leaving.",63
S10E16 Rachels Going Away Party.txt,Rachel,Okay. Oh...,65
S10E16 Rachels Going Away Party.txt,Rachel,Oh!,66
S10E16 Rachels Going Away Party.txt,Chandler,"I'm sor... Just go. Just go. I can't, I can't.",66
S10E16 Rachels Going Away Party.txt,Ross,I don't think so.,68
S10E16 Rachels Going Away Party.txt,Chandler,"Oh, you're definately not. I haven't cried like that in years.",68
S10E16 Rachels Going Away Party.txt,Monica,You cried yesterday at the six o'clock news.,68
S10E16 Rachels Going Away Party.txt,Chandler,That old woman was being scammed by her mechanic.,68
S10E16 Rachels Going Away Party.txt,Phoebe,"I don't know. But, God, Joey seems to be handling it suprisingly well.",69
S10E16 Rachels Going Away Party.txt,All,"No, no, no, no!",70
S10E16 Rachels Going Away Party.txt,Ross,"Okay, here we go...",71
S10E16 Rachels Going Away Party.txt,Ross,Yeah...,72
S10E16 Rachels Going Away Party.txt,Ross,Huh?,73
S10E16 Rachels Going Away Party.txt,Rachel,"Oh, you guys. This was an amazing night. Thank you so much. I love you. Good night.",73
S10E16 Rachels Going Away Party.txt,Ross,What? I don't get a goodbye?,74
S10E16 Rachels Going Away Party.txt,Ross,Unbelievable. She says goodbye to everyone but me.,76
S10E16 Rachels Going Away Party.txt,Monica,"Well, maybe she thought that with all of your history it could be, you know, implicit.",76
S10E16 Rachels Going Away Party.txt,Ross,"Well, it needs to be plicit.",76
S10E16 Rachels Going Away Party.txt,Joey,"All right, let's think about this. I mean, there's got to be an explanation. Uh... did you do anything to make her mad?",76
S10E16 Rachels Going Away Party.txt,Ross,"No, I don't think so.",76
S10E16 Rachels Going Away Party.txt,Phoebe,"You know, maybe she was just really spent from our talk. It was pretty intense.",76
S10E16 Rachels Going Away Party.txt,Monica,Yeah. Mine too.,76
S10E16 Rachels Going Away Party.txt,Chandler,Mine was a humdinger,76
S10E16 Rachels Going Away Party.txt,Phoebe,"Ross, if you're this upset, you should go and talk to her.",77
S10E16 Rachels Going Away Party.txt,Monica,"And say what? ""You owe me a goodbye"", I mean, he's got more pride than that.",77
S10E16 Rachels Going Away Party.txt,Ross,THE HELL I DO!,77
S10E16 Rachels Going Away Party.txt,Ross,I don't get a goodbye?,78
S10E16 Rachels Going Away Party.txt,Rachel,What?,78
S10E16 Rachels Going Away Party.txt,Rachel,Ross...,79
S10E16 Rachels Going Away Party.txt,Monica,I hope Ross isn't too upset.,81
S10E16 Rachels Going Away Party.txt,Joey,I'm sure he's not more bummed out than I am.,81
S10E16 Rachels Going Away Party.txt,Phoebe,Tell me about it.,81
S10E16 Rachels Going Away Party.txt,Chandler,"Well, you can't say we don't know how to throw a party.",81
S10E16 Rachels Going Away Party.txt,Phoebe,"All right, I think I'm gonna head out.",81
S10E16 Rachels Going Away Party.txt,Monica,"Uh, where do you think you're going?",81
S10E16 Rachels Going Away Party.txt,Phoebe,"I thought I was going home to go to bed, but I'm sensing there's something less fun for me to do here.",81
S10E16 Rachels Going Away Party.txt,Monica,We're moving in a couple of days and we've got a lot of packing to do. It would be great if you guys could pitch in.,81
S10E16 Rachels Going Away Party.txt,Chandler,Joey and I can finish up in the guest room.,81
S10E16 Rachels Going Away Party.txt,Monica,Oh no! You and Phoebe are gonna help me in here.,82
S10E16 Rachels Going Away Party.txt,Monica,"Okay, we're gonna start in the kitchen. Plates get put into plate protectors and stacked ten to a box. The silverware gets bundled in rubber bands and then bubble wrapped. Got it?",83
S10E16 Rachels Going Away Party.txt,Monica,"Good! Now I need you to be careful and efficient. And remember, if I am harsh with you, it is only because you are doing it wrong.",83
S10E16 Rachels Going Away Party.txt,Chandler,"Hey Mon, I think I figured out whose handcuffs they are.",83
S10E16 Rachels Going Away Party.txt,Monica,You did? How?,83
S10E16 Rachels Going Away Party.txt,Chandler,"Well, I was cleaning out the closet and I found some pictures of them... being used.",83
S10E16 Rachels Going Away Party.txt,Joey,Who's that dirty old lady?,84
S10E16 Rachels Going Away Party.txt,Chandler,Monica's grandmother.,84
S10E16 Rachels Going Away Party.txt,Monica,Nana liked it rough!,84
S10E16 Rachels Going Away Party.txt,Erica,Hi!,85
S10E16 Rachels Going Away Party.txt,All,Hey!,85
S10E16 Rachels Going Away Party.txt,Joey,"Come on here, have a seat.",85
S10E16 Rachels Going Away Party.txt,Phoebe,How was your night?,85
S10E16 Rachels Going Away Party.txt,Monica,"Erica, are you okay?",86
S10E16 Rachels Going Away Party.txt,Erica,"Yeah, you know, maybe I ate too much. I keep getting these stomach aches. They come and go like every few minutes.",86
S10E16 Rachels Going Away Party.txt,Monica,Oh my God!,86
S10E16 Rachels Going Away Party.txt,Chandler,Relax! We just get her some antacids.,86
S10E16 Rachels Going Away Party.txt,Monica,"She doesn't have a stomach ache, she's in labor.",86
S10E16 Rachels Going Away Party.txt,Chandler,Oh my God!,86
S10E16 Rachels Going Away Party.txt,Phoebe,"Yeah, you got to get to the hospital.",86
S10E16 Rachels Going Away Party.txt,Chandler,"Honey, it's gonna be okay.",87
S10E16 Rachels Going Away Party.txt,Erica,You can do this. Just breathe.,87
S10E16 Rachels Going Away Party.txt,Monica,"Okay, okay... Okay, I feel a little better.",87
S10E16 Rachels Going Away Party.txt,Monica,"Oh... Yes, I'm sure. Oh honey, let's go. Okay bye everyone.",88
S10E16 Rachels Going Away Party.txt,Joey,"Chandler, wait, wait, wait...",89
S10E16 Rachels Going Away Party.txt,Chandler,What?,89
S10E16 Rachels Going Away Party.txt,Joey,"If you get a second, find out where she got that cheeseburger.",89
S10E16 Rachels Going Away Party.txt,Rachel,You really think I didn't say goodbye to you because I don't care?,90
S10E16 Rachels Going Away Party.txt,Ross,That's what it seemed like.,90
S10E16 Rachels Going Away Party.txt,Rachel,"I cannot believe that after ten years, you do not know ONE thing about me.",90
S10E16 Rachels Going Away Party.txt,Ross,"Fine, then why didn't you say something?",90
S10E16 Rachels Going Away Party.txt,Rachel,"Because it is too damn hard Ross. I can't even begin to explain to you how much I'm gonna miss you. When I think about not seeing you every day, it makes me not want to go... Okay, so if you think that I didn't say goodbye to you because you don't mean as much to me as everybody else, you're wrong. It's because you mean more to me. So there, all right, there's your goodbye... Oh!",90
S10E16 Rachels Going Away Party.txt,Ross,Rach!,90
S10E16 Rachels Going Away Party.txt,Rachel,What?,90
S10E16 Rachels Going Away Party.txt,Ross,"You keep, you keep... You can't...",90
S10E16 Rachels Going Away Party.txt,Rachel,WHAT?,90
S10E16 Rachels Going Away Party.txt,Joey,A little more.,92
S10E16 Rachels Going Away Party.txt,Phoebe,"All right, ready?",94
S10E16 Rachels Going Away Party.txt,Joey,"Yeah. All right, now give me your best shot.",94
S10E16 Rachels Going Away Party.txt,Phoebe,"All right, here it goes...",94
S10E02 Ross Is Fine.txt,Joey,"Okay, Ross, I realise that you didn't expect to walk in and see that, but.. Let me explain, okay?",2
S10E02 Ross Is Fine.txt,Rachel,We weren't doing anything!,2
S10E02 Ross Is Fine.txt,Joey,"Rach, he just saw us.",2
S10E02 Ross Is Fine.txt,Rachel,Shhh.,2
S10E02 Ross Is Fine.txt,Joey,"But what you saw, that is the extent of it, okay? One kiss.",2
S10E02 Ross Is Fine.txt,Rachel,"No, come on, that is a lie. We also kissed in Barbados.",2
S10E02 Ross Is Fine.txt,Rachel,"Yeah, you started it! I've got to chill.",3
S10E02 Ross Is Fine.txt,Joey,"Look, we probably should have talked to you about this before it ever happened, but..",3
S10E02 Ross Is Fine.txt,Rachel,"We feel so terrible about this, Ross.",3
S10E02 Ross Is Fine.txt,Joey,"Yeah, but it did happen, so...",3
S10E02 Ross Is Fine.txt,Joey,Ross?,4
S10E02 Ross Is Fine.txt,Rachel,"Ross, say something. Anything.",6
S10E02 Ross Is Fine.txt,Ross,So you two are..?,6

S10E02 Ross Is Fine.txt,Rachel,"No, no, no!",6
S10E02 Ross Is Fine.txt,Ross,"But if I hadn't walked in here, would you..?",6
S10E02 Ross Is Fine.txt,Joey,Probably.,6
S10E02 Ross Is Fine.txt,Joey,"No, no!",7
S10E02 Ross Is Fine.txt,Rachel,"Ross, this is not how we wanted you to find out about this. You have every right to go nuts.",7
S10E02 Ross Is Fine.txt,Ross,I'm not going nuts. Do you see me go nuts?,7
S10E02 Ross Is Fine.txt,Rachel,"No, but you know what I mean.",7
S10E02 Ross Is Fine.txt,Joey,Really?,8
S10E02 Ross Is Fine.txt,Joey,Ross..,9
S10E02 Ross Is Fine.txt,Ross,"It's all working out! Me & Charlie, and you two. You know what we should do?",9
S10E02 Ross Is Fine.txt,Rachel,Calm ourselves?,9
S10E02 Ross Is Fine.txt,Ross,"No. We should all have dinner. Yes, we'll do it tomorrow night. I'll cook!!",9
S10E02 Ross Is Fine.txt,Joey,"Look, don't you think that will be a little weird?",9
S10E02 Ross Is Fine.txt,Joey,I do like fajitas.,10
S10E02 Ross Is Fine.txt,Monica,"God, this adoption stuff is so overwhelming. There's inter-country adoption, dependency adoption.. There are so many ways to go, and this is like the biggest decision of our lives.",11
S10E02 Ross Is Fine.txt,Chandler,There's a hair in my coffee.,11
S10E02 Ross Is Fine.txt,Phoebe,Hey guys!,12
S10E02 Ross Is Fine.txt,Monica,Hey.,12
S10E02 Ross Is Fine.txt,Phoebe,"Hey, have you seen Frank Jr., 'cause he's meeting me here with the triplets.",12
S10E02 Ross Is Fine.txt,Chandler,"You know, it's funny. Every time you say ""triplets,"" I immediately think of three hot blonde 19-year olds.",12
S10E02 Ross Is Fine.txt,Monica,That's sweet. Drink your hair.,13
S10E02 Ross Is Fine.txt,Phoebe,"Hey, what's all this stuff?",13
S10E02 Ross Is Fine.txt,Monica,"Oh, they're brochures from different adoption agencies.",13
S10E02 Ross Is Fine.txt,Phoebe,"Ooh, babies! Oh, this one is so cute, get this one!",13
S10E02 Ross Is Fine.txt,Monica,That's not really how it works.,13
S10E02 Ross Is Fine.txt,Phoebe,"Oh, how does it work?",13
S10E02 Ross Is Fine.txt,Monica,I don't know!,13
S10E02 Ross Is Fine.txt,Phoebe,"Well, if you're having a hard time, you should talk to my friends, Bill and Colleen. They adopted a kid. I'm sure they'd help you.",13
S10E02 Ross Is Fine.txt,Monica,"Thanks, that would be great. Hey, honey, wouldn't that be great?",13
S10E02 Ross Is Fine.txt,Phoebe,Hey!,16
S10E02 Ross Is Fine.txt,Phoebe,Good to see you.,16
S10E02 Ross Is Fine.txt,Monica,Hi Frank.,16
S10E02 Ross Is Fine.txt,Monica,"Oh, my goodness, they've all gotten so big!",16
S10E02 Ross Is Fine.txt,Monica,Which one is which again?,17
S10E02 Ross Is Fine.txt,Joey,"Ah, can I just say I know we're doing this for Ross, and that's cool, but if it was up to me, this is not what we'd be doing on our first date.",19
S10E02 Ross Is Fine.txt,Rachel,"Well, what would we be doing?",19
S10E02 Ross Is Fine.txt,Joey,"I'd take you out for a romantic night. Some champagne, fancy dinner, feel you up on the carriage ride home...",19
S10E02 Ross Is Fine.txt,Rachel,Feel me up?,19
S10E02 Ross Is Fine.txt,Joey,In a carriage!,19
S10E02 Ross Is Fine.txt,Joey,"Hey, Charlie!",20
S10E02 Ross Is Fine.txt,Rachel,Hey.,20
S10E02 Ross Is Fine.txt,Charlie,"Hi, hi. So.. Dreading this?",20
S10E02 Ross Is Fine.txt,Rachel,"Oh, you bet.",20
S10E02 Ross Is Fine.txt,Joey,"So, did you bring a little something for Ross?",21
S10E02 Ross Is Fine.txt,Charlie,Actually.. It's stuff you left at my apartment.,21
S10E02 Ross Is Fine.txt,Joey,"Oh. Oh, thanks.",21
S10E02 Ross Is Fine.txt,Charlie,"And you know, you can just give me my stuff whenever you want.",21
S10E02 Ross Is Fine.txt,Joey,"Yeah, I didn't throw any of that out..",21
S10E02 Ross Is Fine.txt,Rachel,"Okay, well, we brought you some wine.",23
S10E02 Ross Is Fine.txt,Joey,"Uh, actually, that's..",24

S10E02 Ross Is Fine.txt,Charlie,"Gosh, Ross, you know, you seem a little...",24
S10E02 Ross Is Fine.txt,Ross,What? Fine? Because I am! Aren't you? Aren't you? Aren't you? You see? Who else is fine?,24
S10E02 Ross Is Fine.txt,Joey,"Okay, listen, hey, Ross. Why don't you try to relax, okay? Maybe have a drink.",24
S10E02 Ross Is Fine.txt,Ross,You know what? That is a very good idea. I'm gonna go make a pitcher of Margaritas.,24
S10E02 Ross Is Fine.txt,Phoebe,"Oh, god. So adorable. Look at them sleeping there like angels.",26
S10E02 Ross Is Fine.txt,Phoebe,"Well, they may be a handful, but they're so cute.",26
S10E02 Ross Is Fine.txt,Phoebe,"Oh, god, the last time I babysat them, they did the funniest thing..",26
S10E02 Ross Is Fine.txt,Phoebe,"That's a, that's a long time.",26
S10E02 Ross Is Fine.txt,Phoebe,"Yeah, I know, Frank. I counted them when they were coming out of my area.",26
S10E02 Ross Is Fine.txt,Phoebe,What?,26
S10E02 Ross Is Fine.txt,Phoebe,"Oh my god, Frank, are you thinking of leaving? Because I didn't have those triplets so you could just run out on them!",26
S10E02 Ross Is Fine.txt,Phoebe,What?! You can't separate them! That's terrible. Which one?,26
S10E02 Ross Is Fine.txt,Monica,Thank you so much for seeing us. Phoebe has told us such great things about you guys.,27
S10E02 Ross Is Fine.txt,Colleen,"Oh, please, we're happy to help.",27
S10E02 Ross Is Fine.txt,Bill,We went through the same thing when we were adopting.,27
S10E02 Ross Is Fine.txt,Chandler,"So, a lot of malfunctioning wee-wees and hoo-hoos in this room, huh?",27
S10E02 Ross Is Fine.txt,Chandler,"I mean, you have a lovely home.",28
S10E02 Ross Is Fine.txt,Monica,"Well, we appreciate anything you can tell us.",28
S10E02 Ross Is Fine.txt,Colleen,"Well, actually, I think this might help.",28
S10E02 Ross Is Fine.txt,Colleen,It's pretty much all the information you need.,29
S10E02 Ross Is Fine.txt,Monica,Oh my god!,29
S10E02 Ross Is Fine.txt,Colleen,"Everything is broken down into categories, and then cross-referenced, and then colour-coded to correspond with the forms in the back.",29
S10E02 Ross Is Fine.txt,Bill,"I know the process is frustrating, but it's so worth it. Adopting Owen was the best thing that ever happened to us.",30
S10E02 Ross Is Fine.txt,Chandler,"You want me to wash my hands first, don't you?",32
S10E02 Ross Is Fine.txt,Monica,It's.. It's just so pretty and white.,32
S10E02 Ross Is Fine.txt,Colleen,"The bathroom is down the hall, to your left.",32
S10E02 Ross Is Fine.txt,Colleen,I would have told him to do it too.,33
S10E02 Ross Is Fine.txt,Monica,Can I adopt you?,33
S10E02 Ross Is Fine.txt,Chandler,"Hey, you must be Owen.",34
S10E02 Ross Is Fine.txt,Owen,Yeah.,34
S10E02 Ross Is Fine.txt,Chandler,"I'm Chandler. Hey, I was in the scouts too.",34
S10E02 Ross Is Fine.txt,Owen,You were?,34
S10E02 Ross Is Fine.txt,Chandler,"Yeah, in fact my father was a den-mother.",34
S10E02 Ross Is Fine.txt,Owen,Huh?,34
S10E02 Ross Is Fine.txt,Chandler,You know how to use a compass?,34
S10E02 Ross Is Fine.txt,Owen,I have a badge in it.,34
S10E02 Ross Is Fine.txt,Chandler,You do? That's fantastic!,34
S10E02 Ross Is Fine.txt,Owen,You wanna see it?,34
S10E02 Ross Is Fine.txt,Chandler,"I'd love to, but I gotta get back to talking to your parents. They're telling us all about how they adopted you.",34
S10E02 Ross Is Fine.txt,Owen,What?!?,34
S10E02 Ross Is Fine.txt,Chandler,What?,34
S10E02 Ross Is Fine.txt,Owen,I'm adopted?,34
S10E02 Ross Is Fine.txt,Chandler,I got nothing.,35
S10E02 Ross Is Fine.txt,Ross,"The first batch of margaritas was not so great, but the second batch is gooooood.",36
S10E02 Ross Is Fine.txt,Rachel,"Well, maybe the next batch, we could all get some.",36
S10E02 Ross Is Fine.txt,Ross,"Oh, guys, this is fun, isn't it? You know? Just the four of us. Just hangin'.",36
S10E02 Ross Is Fine.txt,Joey,"Dude, are you okay? And when are the fajitas gonna be ready?",36
S10E02 Ross Is Fine.txt,Ross,"I'm fine! Hey, I'm great! I'm just.. I'm just proud of us. There's no weirdness, no tension.",36
S10E02 Ross Is Fine.txt,Rachel,No awareness.,36
S10E02 Ross Is Fine.txt,Ross,"We make a great foursome. We should do more stuff together. Ooh! Let's take a trip. Okay, where do you think we - we can go?",36
S10E02 Ross Is Fine.txt,Ross,My fajitas!!,37
S10E02 Ross Is Fine.txt,Rachel,"Look, Charlie, I just want you to know. Ross is just having a little trouble adjusting to the thought of Joey and me. You know, he normally doesn't drink like this.",38
S10E02 Ross Is Fine.txt,Charlie,"Oh, you know what? This is nothing. My father is a raging alcoholic.",38
S10E02 Ross Is Fine.txt,Charlie,"Oh, I'm sorry, have I made this evening uncomfortable?",39
S10E02 Ross Is Fine.txt,Ross,"Fajitas! Be careful, very hot plate, very hot plate!!",40
S10E02 Ross Is Fine.txt,Rachel,"Ross, you don't even have oven mitts on!",40
S10E02 Ross Is Fine.txt,Ross,That is gonna hurt tomorrow!,41
S10E02 Ross Is Fine.txt,Phoebe,"Okay, well, this is crazy. Can't seriously be talking about me taking one of your kids, can we?",42
S10E02 Ross Is Fine.txt,Phoebe,Insane.,42
S10E02 Ross Is Fine.txt,Phoebe,"Alice would never go for it, right?",42
S10E02 Ross Is Fine.txt,Phoebe,"Well, just you know, for argument's sake, you know, hypothetically. Which one would you be willing to give up?",42
S10E02 Ross Is Fine.txt,Phoebe,Frank Jr.Jr.?,42
S10E02 Ross Is Fine.txt,Phoebe,Uh-huh.,42
S10E02 Ross Is Fine.txt,Phoebe,"Well, alright, that's fine. What about Leslie?",43
S10E02 Ross Is Fine.txt,Phoebe,"Alright, so that leaves Chandler.",43
S10E02 Ross Is Fine.txt,Phoebe,"Wow, Frank. I think we just ran out of kids.",43
S10E02 Ross Is Fine.txt,Phoebe,"I'm sorry, Frank. I didn't realise things were so bad. You know, I'll help out more. I can - I can babysit any time you want. You name the day, and I'll be there.",43
S10E02 Ross Is Fine.txt,Phoebe,"Well, that's not good. But you know, I can move some stuff around, and I'll be there. You and Alice just take the whole day together.",43
S10E02 Ross Is Fine.txt,Phoebe,Are you kidding? That's what sisters are for.,43
S10E02 Ross Is Fine.txt,Chandler,Where are Bill and Colleen?,45
S10E02 Ross Is Fine.txt,Monica,They're in the kitchen getting something to eat. Can you believe how nice they are?,45
S10E02 Ross Is Fine.txt,Chandler,We have to leave!!,45
S10E02 Ross Is Fine.txt,Monica,Why? What did you do in the bathroom?,45
S10E02 Ross Is Fine.txt,Chandler,"I didn't get to the bathroom. I bumped into Owen on the way, and he didn't know he was adopted. And there's a slight chance I may have told him.",45
S10E02 Ross Is Fine.txt,Monica,"Oh my god, where's my purse? No, you know what? I can replace everything in there. Get that binder, and let's go!",45
S10E02 Ross Is Fine.txt,Colleen,Hey.,46
S10E02 Ross Is Fine.txt,Bill,"Some little snacks for everybody. Oh, you don't have to eat the sour worms. Those are for Owen.",46
S10E02 Ross Is Fine.txt,Colleen,"I'll go get him in a second. By the way, you should know we haven't told him he's adopted yet.",46
S10E02 Ross Is Fine.txt,Chandler,But kids are so intuitive. Don't you think on some level he already knows?,46
S10E02 Ross Is Fine.txt,Owen,I'm adopted?!,47
S10E02 Ross Is Fine.txt,Chandler,See? Intuitive!,47
S10E02 Ross Is Fine.txt,Bill,What? Where did you hear that?,47
S10E02 Ross Is Fine.txt,Owen,He told me! And he paid me 50 dollars not to tell.,47
S10E02 Ross Is Fine.txt,Chandler,Which technically now you should give back!,47
S10E02 Ross Is Fine.txt,Colleen,You told him he's adopted?,47
S10E02 Ross Is Fine.txt,Chandler,"I'm so sorry, but you should have a sign out there or something. Or at least whisper it to people when they come in the door. ""Owen doesn't know he's adopted, and he also thinks that Santa is real.""",47
S10E02 Ross Is Fine.txt,Owen,He isn't?!,47
S10E02 Ross Is Fine.txt,Ross,Everyone? I would like to make a toast to Rachel and Joey.,49
S10E02 Ross Is Fine.txt,Rachel,Ooy.,49
S10E02 Ross Is Fine.txt,Ross,"And to love. Ah, love. L-O-V-E, love. L is for life. And what is life without love?",49
S10E02 Ross Is Fine.txt,Rachel,"Oh my god, are we supposed to answer?",49
S10E02 Ross Is Fine.txt,Ross,"O is for ""oh, wow!"" The V is for this very surprising turn of events, which I'm still fine with by the way. E is for how extremely normal I find it. That you two are together. And now one day you might get married and have children of your own.",49
S10E02 Ross Is Fine.txt,Joey,"Dude, are you okay?",50
S10E02 Ross Is Fine.txt,Ross,Totally.,50
S10E02 Ross Is Fine.txt,Rachel,"Ross, you don't seem okay.",50
S10E02 Ross Is Fine.txt,Charlie,"Wait, Ross. Ross. I - I have to take off.",51
S10E02 Ross Is Fine.txt,Ross,No!,51
S10E02 Ross Is Fine.txt,Charlie,"I'm sorry, I have a really early class in the morning, but this has been lovely.",51
S10E02 Ross Is Fine.txt,Ross,Wasn't it? And you thought it would be awkward with Joey and that you never really liked Rachel.,51
S10E02 Ross Is Fine.txt,Charlie,"You're on fire! I'll call you in the morning, okay?",51
S10E02 Ross Is Fine.txt,Ross,Okay.,51
S10E02 Ross Is Fine.txt,Charlie,Alright.,51
S10E02 Ross Is Fine.txt,Charlie,"God, Rachel, what Ross just said that is just so..",52
S10E02 Ross Is Fine.txt,Rachel,"Oh, that's okay, girls tend not to like me.",52
S10E02 Ross Is Fine.txt,Charlie,Bye.,52
S10E02 Ross Is Fine.txt,Ross,"Okay, I guess it's just flan for three! Hey, hey, that rhymed!",53
S10E02 Ross Is Fine.txt,Rachel,"You know what, Ross? I think we're gonna take off too.",53
S10E02 Ross Is Fine.txt,Ross,"Oh, oh. Of course. God, I'm so stupid. You guys are a couple now. I mean, you probably just want to be alone.",53
S10E02 Ross Is Fine.txt,Rachel,"No, no, it's just that it's getting late...",53
S10E02 Ross Is Fine.txt,Ross,"Hey, hey, it's fine. It's totally fine. We've got plenty of margaritas. It's all good.",53
S10E02 Ross Is Fine.txt,Ross,I don't even know what that's for.,54
S10E02 Ross Is Fine.txt,Joey,You know what? I think I'm gonna stay here and make sure he's okay.,55
S10E02 Ross Is Fine.txt,Rachel,"Yeah, that's probably a good idea.",55
S10E02 Ross Is Fine.txt,Joey,Yeah. I'll see you in the morning.,55
S10E02 Ross Is Fine.txt,Rachel,"Uh-huh. Okay. You know what, Joey, I don't think he's ever gonna be okay with this.",55
S10E02 Ross Is Fine.txt,Joey,"It doesn't look good, does it?",55
S10E02 Ross Is Fine.txt,Joey,Morning. Here you go.,57
S10E02 Ross Is Fine.txt,Ross,Thanks. Did you stay here all night?,57
S10E02 Ross Is Fine.txt,Joey,Yeah.,57
S10E02 Ross Is Fine.txt,Ross,So you took off my pants and shoes?,57
S10E02 Ross Is Fine.txt,Joey,"No, no, no. You actually did that when you were dancing to the Chicago-soundtrack. Look, Ross, about, about Rachel and I. Listen, you don't have to worry about that, okay? Because nothing is gonna happen.",57
S10E02 Ross Is Fine.txt,Ross,What do you mean?,57
S10E02 Ross Is Fine.txt,Joey,"Well, she and I said from the beginning that we weren't gonna do anything unless you were okay with it. And clearly..",57
S10E02 Ross Is Fine.txt,Ross,"Hey, what are you talking about? I'm fine!",57
S10E02 Ross Is Fine.txt,Joey,"It's okay, Ross, alright? I totally understand. Of course you're not fine. You're.. You're Ross and Rachel.",57
S10E02 Ross Is Fine.txt,Ross,"Except we're not. I mean, we haven't been a couple in like, six years. Oh my god, is that right? Has it been that long?",57
S10E02 Ross Is Fine.txt,Joey,"That's what I hear, yeah.",57
S10E02 Ross Is Fine.txt,Ross,"This is crazy. I mean, six years? And because of me you guys aren't gonna be together? Can I ask you something? Really, what is this thing with you and Rachel?",57
S10E02 Ross Is Fine.txt,Joey,"Come on, I mean, you know me, you know...",57
S10E02 Ross Is Fine.txt,Ross,Joey.,57
S10E02 Ross Is Fine.txt,Joey,I'm crazy about her.,57
S10E02 Ross Is Fine.txt,Ross,And she feels the same way?,57
S10E02 Ross Is Fine.txt,Joey,I think so.,57
S10E02 Ross Is Fine.txt,Ross,"Well, then, maybe it's time we all moved on.",57
S10E02 Ross Is Fine.txt,Joey,"Yeah, but, Ross, I mean, you're not okay with it.",57
S10E02 Ross Is Fine.txt,Ross,"No, but I wanna be. Hey, I will be. Besides, I'm with Charlie, right? Oh my god, I'm still with Charlie, aren't I? I mean, she didn't see the dance, did she?",57
S10E02 Ross Is Fine.txt,Joey,"No, no, no, no, that was - that was just for me. Are you sure about this?",57
S10E02 Ross Is Fine.txt,Ross,"Yeah, I'm sure.",57
S10E02 Ross Is Fine.txt,Joey,And we're okay?,57
S10E02 Ross Is Fine.txt,Monica,"Hey, Phoebs",59
S10E02 Ross Is Fine.txt,Phoebe,Hey.,59
S10E02 Ross Is Fine.txt,Monica,"Uhm, we just wanna give you a heads-up. Bill and Colleen hate us.",59
S10E02 Ross Is Fine.txt,Chandler,"Owen didn't know he was adopted, and Monica told him.",59
S10E02 Ross Is Fine.txt,Monica,What?,59
S10E02 Ross Is Fine.txt,Phoebe,"Still, he had to find out sometime.",59
S10E02 Ross Is Fine.txt,Chandler,"Yeah, but how would you like it if someone told the triplets that you gave birth to them?",59
S02E07 Ross Finds Out.txt,Chan,"OK, what is it about me? Do I not look fun enough? Is there something. . . repellant. . . about me?",2
S02E07 Ross Finds Out.txt,Rach,"So, how was the party?",2
S02E07 Ross Finds Out.txt,Chan,"Well it couldn't have been worse. A woman literally passed through me. OK, so what is it, am I hideously unattractive?",2
S02E07 Ross Finds Out.txt,Phoe,"No, you are not, you are very attractive. You know what, I go through the exact same thing. Every time I put on a little weight, I start questioning everyting.",2
S02E07 Ross Finds Out.txt,Chan,"Woah, woah, I've put on a little weight?",2
S02E07 Ross Finds Out.txt,Phoe,"No, not wieght... y'know, more like insulation.",2
S02E07 Ross Finds Out.txt,Mnca,"Chandler, I'm unemployed and in dire need of a project. Ya wanna work out? I can remake you.",2

S02E07 Ross Finds Out.txt,Phoe,"No, whad'ya mean? He's not British.",12
S02E07 Ross Finds Out.txt,Joey,Maybe he's. . . gay.,12
S02E07 Ross Finds Out.txt,Phoe,"Oohh, um, no, I don't think that's the problem. 'Cause we went, um, dancing the other night and the way he held me so close, and the way he was looking into my eyes I just like... definitely felt something.",12
S02E07 Ross Finds Out.txt,Rach,"Yeah, but how much can you tell from a look?",12

S02E07 Ross Finds Out.txt,Mich,"Monica told you I was cuter that this, didn't she?",25
S02E07 Ross Finds Out.txt,Rach,"Oh, no, Michael, it's not you. I'm sorry, it's just, it's this thing. It's probably not as bad as it sounds but this friend of mine is, is getting a cat with his girlfriend.",25

S02E07 Ross Finds Out.txt,Phoe,Why Scott doesn't want to sleep with me. It's 'cause I'm not sexy enough.,26
S02E07 Ross Finds Out.txt,Joey,"Phoebe, that's crazy. When I first met you, you know what I said to Chandler? I said, ""Excellent butt, great rack.""",26
S02E07 Ross Finds Out.txt,Phoe,"Really? That's so sweet. I mean, I'm officially offended but, sweet.",26

S02E07 Ross Finds Out.txt,Rach,"Yeah! Closure. That's what it is, that's what I need. God, you're brilliant! Why didn't I think of that? How do I get that?",31
S02E07 Ross Finds Out.txt,Mich,"Well, you know, there's no one way really, it's just, you know, whatever it takes so that you can finally say to him, ""I'm over you.""",31

S02E07 Ross Finds Out.txt,Joey,"All right Phoebs, way to go.",54
S02E07 Ross Finds Out.txt,Phoe,Yay me.,54
S02E07 Ross Finds Out.txt,Joey,"So, so how did it happen?",54
S02E07 Ross Finds Out.txt,Phoe,"Well, I finally took your advice and asked him what was going on.",54
S02E07 Ross Finds Out.txt,Joey,And what did he say?,54
S02E07 Ross Finds Out.txt,Phoe,"He said that, um, he understands how sex can be like, a very emotional thing for a woman and he was just afraid that I was gonna get all, y'know, like, 'ohh, is he gonna call me the next day' and, y'know, 'where is this going' and, ya know, blah-la-la-la-la. So he said he wanted to hold off until he was prepared to be really serious.",54
S02E07 Ross Finds Out.txt,Joey,Wow.,54
S02E07 Ross Finds Out.txt,Phoe,"Yeah, so I said, ""OK, relax please,"" y'know, I mean, sex can be just about two people right there in the moment, y'know, it's, if he wants to see me again he can call and if not, that's fine too. So after a looooot of talking. . . I convinced him.",54
S02E07 Ross Finds Out.txt,Joey,"Let me get this straight. He got you to beg to sleep with him, he got you to say he never has to call you again, and he got you thinking this was a great idea.",54
S02E07 Ross Finds Out.txt,Phoe,Um-hum.,54
S02E07 Ross Finds Out.txt,Joey,This man is my God.,54
S02E07 Ross Finds Out.txt,Rach,Hi.,55
S02E07 Ross Finds Out.txt,Ross,I didn't get a cat.,55
S02E07 Ross Finds Out.txt,Rach,"Oh, that's um, interesting.",55
S02E07 Ross Finds Out.txt,Ross,"No, no it's not interesting. OK, it's very, very not interesting. In fact it's actually 100 percent completely opposite of interesting.",55
S02E07 Ross Finds Out.txt,Rach,"Alright, I got it Ross.",55
S02E07 Ross Finds Out.txt,Ross,You had no right to tell me you ever had feelings for me.,55
S02E07 Ross Finds Out.txt,Ross,I was doing great with Julie before I found out about you.,56
S02E07 Ross Finds Out.txt,Rach,"Hey, I was doin' great before I found out about you. You think it's easy for me to see you with Julie?",56
S02E07 Ross Finds Out.txt,Ross,Then you should have said something before I met her.,56
S02E07 Ross Finds Out.txt,Rach,I didn't know then. And how come you never said anything to me.,56
S02E07 Ross Finds Out.txt,Ross,There was never a good time.,56
S02E07 Ross Finds Out.txt,Rach,"Right, you, you only had a year. We only hung out every night.",56
S02E07 Ross Finds Out.txt,Ross,"Not, not, not every night. You know, and... and it's not like I didn't try, Rachel, but things got in the way, y'know? Like, like Italian guys or ex-fiances or, or, or Italian guys.",56

S05E12 Chandlers Work Laugh.txt,Chandler,"So I laugh at my boss's jokes, what's the big deal?",80
S05E12 Chandlers Work Laugh.txt,Monica,I'd rather hang out with a sniveling work weasel guy when I can be hanging out with my boyfriend who I actually respect.,80

S02E01 Rosss New Girlfriend.txt,Phoebe,"Ok, so this is pretty much what's happened so far. Ross was in love with Rachel since, you know, forever, but every time he tried to tell her, something kind of got in the way, like cats, and Italian guys. Finally Chandler was like ""forget about her"" but when Ross was in China on his dig, Chandler let it slip that Ross was in love with Rachel. She was like, ""Oh my god."" So she went to the airport to meet him when he came back, but what she didn't know was, that Ross was getting off the plane with another woman. Uh-Oh! So, that's pretty much everything you need to know. But, enough about us. So, how've you been?",2
S02E01 Rosss New Girlfriend.txt,Ross,"It was, it was great. Oh, what happened?",6
S02E01 Rosss New Girlfriend.txt,Rachel,What?,6

S02E01 Rosss New Girlfriend.txt,Chandler, No way!,10
S02E01 Rosss New Girlfriend.txt,Monica,"I'm telling you, she went to the airport, and she's gonna go for it with Ross!",10
S02E01 Rosss New Girlfriend.txt,Phoebe,"Oh my god. This is huge. This is bigger than huge. This is like, all right, what's bigger than huge?",10
S02E01 Rosss New Girlfriend.txt,Joey,"Um, this?",10

S02E01 Rosss New Girlfriend.txt,Ross,200 at least.,16
S02E01 Rosss New Girlfriend.txt,Julie, ...and this guy...,16
S02E01 Rosss New Girlfriend.txt,Rachel,"And the chicken pooped in her lap. Oh, I'm so sorry. I just gave away the ending, didn't I? Oh! It's just, I just heard this story in the cab, and it is all I can think about.",16
S02E01 Rosss New Girlfriend.txt,Monica,"This is amazing. I mean, how, how did this happen?",16
S02E01 Rosss New Girlfriend.txt,Julie,"Well, Ross and I were in grad school together.",16
S02E01 Rosss New Girlfriend.txt,Ross,"But we haven't seen each other since then. Well I land in China, guess who's in charge of the dig.",16
S02E01 Rosss New Girlfriend.txt,Rachel,"Julie! Julie, isn't that great? I mean, isn't that just kick-you-in-the-crotch, spit-on-your-neck fantastic?",16

S02E01 Rosss New Girlfriend.txt,Chandler,Not yet.,20
S02E01 Rosss New Girlfriend.txt,Rachel,"Then, no.",20
S02E01 Rosss New Girlfriend.txt,Chandler,"So what the hell happened to you in China? I mean, when last we left you, you were totally in love with, you know.",21
S02E01 Rosss New Girlfriend.txt,Ross,"I know, I know I was, but there was always this little voice inside that kept saying it's never gonna happen, move on. You know whose voice that was?",21
S02E01 Rosss New Girlfriend.txt,Chandler,God?,21
S02E01 Rosss New Girlfriend.txt,Ross,"It was you, pal.",21
S02E01 Rosss New Girlfriend.txt,Chandler,"Well, maybe it was God, doing me.",21
S02E01 Rosss New Girlfriend.txt,Ross,"Look, you were right. She looks at me and sees a friend, that's all. But then I met Julie, and I don't know, we're havin' a great time. And I have to say, I never would've gone for it with her if it hadn't been for you.",21
S02E01 Rosss New Girlfriend.txt,Chandler,"Well, you owe me one, big guy.",21
S02E01 Rosss New Girlfriend.txt,Ross,I didn't order lemonade.,22

S02E01 Rosss New Girlfriend.txt,Ross,But...,22
S02E01 Rosss New Girlfriend.txt,Chandler,"He said...he said, he said that they're having a great time. I'm sorry. But, the silver lining, if you wanna see it, is that he made the decision all by himself!  Without any outside help whatsoever.",23
S02E01 Rosss New Girlfriend.txt,Rachel,How is that the silver lining?,23
S02E01 Rosss New Girlfriend.txt,Chandler,You have to really wanna see it.,23
S02E01 Rosss New Girlfriend.txt,Ross,"Ironically, these are the guys who were picked last in gym.",24

S02E01 Rosss New Girlfriend.txt,Phoebe,"Oh, ok. How, it's been so long since you've had sex, you're wondering if they've changed it?",25
S02E01 Rosss New Girlfriend.txt,Monica,"No, although now that's what I'm thinking.",25
S02E01 Rosss New Girlfriend.txt,Phoebe,"All right, so what were you thinking?",25
S02E01 Rosss New Girlfriend.txt,Monica,"Well, I was thinking, that you gave the guys such great haircuts, I thought, maybe you'd like to do mine?",25
S02E01 Rosss New Girlfriend.txt,Phoebe,Ohh! No.,25
S02E01 Rosss New Girlfriend.txt,Monica,Why not?,25
S02E01 Rosss New Girlfriend.txt,Phoebe,"Because, I'm just, I'm incredibly anal and an unbelievable control freak.",25

S09E23-S09E24 In Barbados.txt,Chandler,"David, let me stop you there 'cause I think I see where this is going. I'm not very good at giving advice. So if you want advice, go to Ross, Monica, or... Joey, if the thing you wanna advice about is pizza toppings or burning sensation when you pee.",22

S09E23-S09E24 In Barbados.txt,Monica,"Chandler, we have talked about this. You are not supposed to give people advice! Now couldn't you just have made some sort of inappropriate joke?",42
S09E23-S09E24 In Barbados.txt,Chandler,"I did! A penis one! Look, just so I know, what was so wrong about what I said?",42
S09E23-S09E24 In Barbados.txt,Monica,"They've only been going out for a few weeks and Phoebe is completely hung up on Mike! She'll say ""No"", David's heart will be broken, it will be too hard for them to recover from and then Phoebe will end up alone again.",42
S09E23-S09E24 In Barbados.txt,Chandler,"Man, that's some bad advice!",42
S09E23-S09E24 In Barbados.txt,Joey,Oh! Hey! Thank God you guys are here!,44
S09E23-S09E24 In Barbados.txt,Rachel,Hey! Hey what's going on?,44

S09E23-S09E24 In Barbados.txt,Monica,"Yeah, right!",51
S09E23-S09E24 In Barbados.txt,David,"Yeah, well, being a failed scientist doesn't pay quite as well as you might think. That's uhm... one seventieth of a karat. And the clarity is uhm... is quite poor.",54
S09E23-S09E24 In Barbados.txt,Monica,Ok!,56
S09E23-S09E24 In Barbados.txt,Chandler,David is going to propose to Phoebe tonight!,56
S09E23-S09E24 In Barbados.txt,Monica,See what happens when you give people advice? I hope you told him not to?,56
S09E23-S09E24 In Barbados.txt,Chandler,That would be advice!!,56
S09E23-S09E24 In Barbados.txt,Phoebe,Yeah?,57
S09E23-S09E24 In Barbados.txt,Monica,"Ok, my husband just gave your boyfriend some very bad advice. Look, David is going to propose to you tonight.",59

S09E23-S09E24 In Barbados.txt,Monica,What are you serious? You wanna marry him? Wha... What about Mike?,59
S09E23-S09E24 In Barbados.txt,Monica,Do you really think marrying someone else is the right answer?,60
S09E23-S09E24 In Barbados.txt,Phoebe,"Sure! Look, ok, bottom line: I love Mike... David! David. I love David. Don't look at me that way, Roseanne Rosannadanna!",60

S09E23-S09E24 In Barbados.txt,Chandler,"Well, it didn't say ""This is a virus""!!",68
S09E23-S09E24 In Barbados.txt,Ross,What did it say?,68
S09E23-S09E24 In Barbados.txt,Ross,"What... what am I gonna do? My speech is gone, Chandler!",69
S09E23-S09E24 In Barbados.txt,Chandler,"It's not gone! I mean, I'm sure you printed out a copy. You have a hard copy, right?",69

S09E23-S09E24 In Barbados.txt,Joey,I could teach you a speech that I memorized for auditions.,72

S09E23-S09E24 In Barbados.txt,Charlie,Didn't you feel so stupid that you didn't see the signs? My fiancé was always going away on these long weekends with his tennis partner.,99

S04E18 Rachels New Dress.txt,Joey,"Yeah, that guy really hurt us.",23
S04E18 Rachels New Dress.txt,Phoebe,"Well, how about a compromise then, okay? What if it’s like y’know, Chanoey?",23
S04E18 Rachels New Dress.txt,Chandler,"Okay, look, Joey! Come on, think about it, first of all, he’ll never be President. There’s never gonna be a President Joey.",23
S04E18 Rachels New Dress.txt,Joey,"All right look man, I didn’t want to bring this up, but Chandler, is the stupidest name I ever heard in my life! It’s not even a name; it’s barely even a word. Okay? It’s kinda like chandelier, but it’s not! All right? It’s a stupid, stupid non-name!",23
S04E18 Rachels New Dress.txt,Chandler,"Wow, you’re, you’re right. I have a horrible, horrible name.",23

S04E18 Rachels New Dress.txt,Joshua,"So, all right.",32
S04E18 Rachels New Dress.txt,Joshua,"Nothing I uh, it’s just that I know that they’re still out there.",34
S04E18 Rachels New Dress.txt,Rachel,"But, they’re across the hall! I mean that’s two doors away, it would take them a long time to peck their way back over here.",34
S04E18 Rachels New Dress.txt,Joshua,"Okay, that’s-that’s not funny. Uhh.",34
S04E18 Rachels New Dress.txt,Rachel,"Okay, y’know, would you feel better if we went someplace else? I mean we could pack all this stuff up and y’know go to your apartment.",34
S04E18 Rachels New Dress.txt,Joshua,"Oh, they’re working on this week, it’s a total mess. But uh, I’m staying at my parents’ house, we could go there.",34
S04E18 Rachels New Dress.txt,Rachel,Your parents’?,34

S04E18 Rachels New Dress.txt,Ross,"Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Uh, by the by, did it uh, did it ever occur to you that, I don’t know, maybe they might be having a little too much fun?",38
S04E18 Rachels New Dress.txt,Carol,What’s too much fun?,38
S04E18 Rachels New Dress.txt,Ross,"Y’know, the kind of fun, you and Susan had when we were married.",38
S04E18 Rachels New Dress.txt,Carol,"Oh my God, you are so paranoid!",38

S04E18 Rachels New Dress.txt,Carol,Yes!,38
S04E18 Rachels New Dress.txt,Ross,Am I?!,38
S04E18 Rachels New Dress.txt,Carol,"I can’t speak for Emily, but Susan is in a loving, committed relationship.",38
S04E18 Rachels New Dress.txt,Ross,"Uh-huh, Carol, so were we. All right, just-just imagine for a moment, Susan meets someone and-and they really hit it off. Y’know? Say-say they’re coming back from the theatre, and they-they stop at a pub for a couple of drinks, they’re laughing, y’know, someone innocently touches someone else… There’s electricity, it’s new. It’s exciting. Are you telling me there isn’t even the slightest possibility of something happening?",38
S04E18 Rachels New Dress.txt,Carol,Maybe.,38
S04E18 Rachels New Dress.txt,Ross,OH MY GOD!! I didn’t really believe it until you just said it!!,38
S04E18 Rachels New Dress.txt,Joshua,"…and even though none of the other kids believed me, I swear to God, that duck pushed me!",39
S04E18 Rachels New Dress.txt,Rachel,Wow! This place is fabulous!,39
S04E18 Rachels New Dress.txt,Joshua,"Yeah, yeah, let me show you around. This is the uh, downstairs living room.",39
S04E18 Rachels New Dress.txt,Rachel,"Whoa-whoa, there’s two living rooms? God, growing up here, this place must’ve been a real babe magnet.",39
S04E18 Rachels New Dress.txt,Joshua,"Yeah, well, it would’ve been, but uh, my parents just moved here.",39
S04E18 Rachels New Dress.txt,Rachel,"Ohh, you should know, this place is a real babe magnet. Wanna make out?",39
S04E18 Rachels New Dress.txt,Joshua,"Hey, here’s an idea. Why don’t uh, I put the food in the fridge and we can eat it later?",40
S04E18 Rachels New Dress.txt,Rachel,"That sounds like a plan. Umm, is there a place I can go freshen up?",40
S04E18 Rachels New Dress.txt,Joshua,"Oh yeah, yeah uh, it’s down the hall and uh, second door to your left.",40
S04E18 Rachels New Dress.txt,Rachel,Ah.,40
S04E18 Rachels New Dress.txt,Joshua,"Mom, Dad, what are you guys doing here?",41
S04E18 Rachels New Dress.txt,Joshua,"Umm, this may be a little weird, but I-I-I got a date here.",41
S04E18 Rachels New Dress.txt,Joshua,"Oh, that-that would be great. So you didn’t even get to Italy?",41
S04E18 Rachels New Dress.txt,Rachel,Hi you!,42
S04E18 Rachels New Dress.txt,Joshua,Oh my God!,42
S04E18 Rachels New Dress.txt,Rachel,"I know, I can do more than cook.",42

S04E18 Rachels New Dress.txt,Joey,"Dude, I am sorry about what I said!",47
S04E18 Rachels New Dress.txt,Chandler,"No, no, you’re right, it is a ridiculous name!",47
S04E18 Rachels New Dress.txt,Joey,It’s not that bad.,47
S04E18 Rachels New Dress.txt,Chandler,"Yes it is! From now on, I have no first name.",47
S04E18 Rachels New Dress.txt,Joey,"So, you’re just Bing?",47
S04E18 Rachels New Dress.txt,Chandler,I have no name.,47
S04E18 Rachels New Dress.txt,Phoebe,"All right, so, what are we supposed to call you?",47
S04E18 Rachels New Dress.txt,Chandler,"Okay uh, for now, temporarily, you can call me, Clint.",47
S04E18 Rachels New Dress.txt,Joey,No way are you cool enough to pull of Clint.,47

S04E18 Rachels New Dress.txt,Phoebe,Oh my God!,49
S04E18 Rachels New Dress.txt,Monica,"Oh, no!",49
S04E18 Rachels New Dress.txt,Rachel,So?,51
S04E18 Rachels New Dress.txt,Ross,So! Poetry? Susan’s gay! They’re being gay together!,51
S04E18 Rachels New Dress.txt,Monica,Emily’s straight.,51
S04E18 Rachels New Dress.txt,Ross,"Oh, wake up!",51
S04E18 Rachels New Dress.txt,Phoebe,"Wow, Carol really messed you up!",51
S04E18 Rachels New Dress.txt,Ross,Excuse me?,51
S04E18 Rachels New Dress.txt,Ross,"Look, I don’t know what you’re talking about, I am not a crazy, jealous person.",52
S04E18 Rachels New Dress.txt,Rachel,Huh.,52
S04E18 Rachels New Dress.txt,Ross,What?,52
S04E18 Rachels New Dress.txt,Rachel,"She’s totally right! When we were together, you got all freaked out about Mark and there was nothing going on.",52
S04E18 Rachels New Dress.txt,Monica,This totally makes sense!,52
S04E18 Rachels New Dress.txt,Ross,It does not!,52
S04E18 Rachels New Dress.txt,Monica,"Oh, sure it does! In high school, you weren’t jealous at all even though all your girlfriends were cheating on you!",52
S04E18 Rachels New Dress.txt,Phoebe,"All right, all right, so up until ‘92-93 he was very trusting, then ’94 hit, Carol left him and bamn! Paranoid city!",52
S04E18 Rachels New Dress.txt,Rachel,Absolutely! Absolutely!,52
S04E18 Rachels New Dress.txt,Monica,This is so much fun!,52
S04E18 Rachels New Dress.txt,Ross,This is not fun!,52
S04E18 Rachels New Dress.txt,Monica,"Look, all we’re trying to say is, don’t let what happened with Carol ruin what you got with Emily.",52
S04E18 Rachels New Dress.txt,Phoebe,Yeah. The ’92 Ross wouldn’t.,52
S04E18 Rachels New Dress.txt,Ross,"Well, I still think I was right about that whole Mark thing.",52
S04E18 Rachels New Dress.txt,Rachel,"What—yeah—what, y’know what? I hope Emily is a lesbian.",52
S04E18 Rachels New Dress.txt,Phoebe,Drum roll.,53
S04E18 Rachels New Dress.txt,Joey,"Nah, you’re not tall enough to be a Mark, but you might make a good Barney.",54
S04E18 Rachels New Dress.txt,Chandler,"All right look, am I serious, okay? Tomorrow at 3:30 I am going down to the courthouse.",54
S04E18 Rachels New Dress.txt,Phoebe,You’re actually going through with this?,54
S04E18 Rachels New Dress.txt,Chandler,"Hey, look, this name has been holding me back my entire life. Okay, it’s probably why kids picked on me in school, and why I never do well with women… So, as of 4 o’clock tomorrow, I’m either gonna be Mark Johnson or John Markson.",54
S04E18 Rachels New Dress.txt,Phoebe,"Yeah, but you have to keep the name too!",56
S04E18 Rachels New Dress.txt,Chandler,Okay. Thanks.,56

S04E06 The Dirty Girl.txt,Rachel,"Yeah, so what is she, like a... like a spokesmodel, or an aerobics instructor, what?",5
S04E06 The Dirty Girl.txt,Ross,"Actually she's a paleontology doctoral candidate, specializing in the centazoic era.",5
S04E06 The Dirty Girl.txt,Chandler,"Okay, but that's, like, the easiest era.",5
S04E06 The Dirty Girl.txt,Ross,"I've seen her at work, but I always figured, ah-huh? But, uh, I made her dinner. We had a great time. And we're going out again tomorrow.",5
S04E06 The Dirty Girl.txt,Rachel,Well maybe she and her friends are just having a contest to see who can bring home the biggest geek.,5
S04E06 The Dirty Girl.txt,Ross,Fine by me; hope she wins.,5
S04E06 The Dirty Girl.txt,Chandler,Hi. You guys have any wrapping paper?,6

S04E06 The Dirty Girl.txt,Chandler,"Okay, but don't touch it, because you fingers have destructive oils.",6
S04E06 The Dirty Girl.txt,Rachel,"Huh. Well, then you'd better keep it away from Ross's hair. So this is pretty rare. How did you get that?",6
S04E06 The Dirty Girl.txt,Chandler,"Oh, it wasn't a big deal. I just went to a couple of bookstores, talked to a couple of dealers... called a couple of the author's grandchildren.",6
S04E06 The Dirty Girl.txt,Rachel,"Oh, honey, that's so sweet.",6
S04E06 The Dirty Girl.txt,Phoebe,"Yeah, and what a great way to say, ""I secretly love you, roommate's girlfriend!""",6
S04E06 The Dirty Girl.txt,Chandler,It doesn't say that. Does it?,6
S04E06 The Dirty Girl.txt,Ross,How do you think it's gonna look when you get her something incredibly meaningful and expensive and her boyfriend Joey gives her an orange?,6
S04E06 The Dirty Girl.txt,Chandler,"Okay, all right, I'll just uh, make sure that uh, Joey gets her something really great.",6
S04E06 The Dirty Girl.txt,Phoebe,It's gotta be better than that book. Oo! Like a crossbow!,6
S04E06 The Dirty Girl.txt,Rachel,Oh my God! What happened?,7
S04E06 The Dirty Girl.txt,Monica,Sixty guests.,7
S04E06 The Dirty Girl.txt,Ross,"So, uh, why did you have to turn it down?",7
S04E06 The Dirty Girl.txt,Monica,Because I don't have the money or the equipment to handle something that big on such short notice. I mean there's no way.,7
S04E06 The Dirty Girl.txt,Monica,I don't know.,8
S04E06 The Dirty Girl.txt,Phoebe,"There you go, that's the spirit! Okay! Now, if you need money, I will lend you money, but just get moving!",8
S04E06 The Dirty Girl.txt,Monica,Really? Cause I'd need like $500 for all the food and the supplies and stuff.,8
S04E06 The Dirty Girl.txt,Phoebe,"Okay! It's worth it, if it will get you moving. You haven't worked in months.",8
S04E06 The Dirty Girl.txt,Monica,"Well, you're not working either.",8

S04E06 The Dirty Girl.txt,Phoebe,"Ooo, a crossword! Can I help?",12
S04E06 The Dirty Girl.txt,Rachel,"No! I'm sorry, honey, it's just that last week I got all but three answers and I really want to finish a whole one without any help.",12
S04E06 The Dirty Girl.txt,Phoebe,Fine. But you can't help me develop my new universal language.,12
S04E06 The Dirty Girl.txt,Monica,Hey!,13
S04E06 The Dirty Girl.txt,Rachel,"Hey, how'd it go?",13
S04E06 The Dirty Girl.txt,Monica,"Oh my God, it was the best funeral ever! I mean, everyone loved the food, and guess what? I even got another funeral for tomorrow—the dead-guy-from-today's best friend. I mean, it is like I am the official caterer for that accident!",13

S04E06 The Dirty Girl.txt,Phoebe,"I'll have one, please. Plus my money.",14
S04E06 The Dirty Girl.txt,Monica,"Oh. Well, I didn't realize that you needed it back right away. I mean, you told me to go and be a caterer. So I went. I beed. I mean, I... I used it to buy all this stuff. But look—I've got another job tomorrow, so I'll pay you back with the money I make from that.",14
S04E06 The Dirty Girl.txt,Phoebe,"Oh. Okay. Oo, sorry I acted like a bank.",14
S04E06 The Dirty Girl.txt,Monica,Okay.,14
S04E06 The Dirty Girl.txt,Cheryl,"Um, would you like to come in?",16

S04E06 The Dirty Girl.txt,Ross,"Well, I do! Why don't we go back to my place, light a couple of candles, break open a box of Cinnamon Fruit Toasties, uh...",19
S04E06 The Dirty Girl.txt,Cheryl,I'd rather not.,19
S04E06 The Dirty Girl.txt,Ross,"Oh, yeah, why not?",19
S04E06 The Dirty Girl.txt,Cheryl,"Okay, um, don't take this the wrong way, but your place kinda has a weird smell.",19
S04E06 The Dirty Girl.txt,Monica,"Oh, is everything in the car?",20
S04E06 The Dirty Girl.txt,Phoebe,Yes. Did you settle the bill?,20

S04E06 The Dirty Girl.txt,Chandler,Huh-huh! You can't give her that.,27
S04E06 The Dirty Girl.txt,Joey,Why not?,27
S04E06 The Dirty Girl.txt,Chandler,Because she's not eleven! And it's not the seventh night of Hanukkah!,27
S04E06 The Dirty Girl.txt,Rachel,"Okay, honey, what he means by that, is ...while this is a very nice gift, maybe it's just not something a boyfriend gives?",27
S04E06 The Dirty Girl.txt,Joey,"Sure it is! She needs a pen for work, she's writing, she turns it over.... ""Whoa! It's time for my date with Joey!""",27

S04E06 The Dirty Girl.txt,Monica,What?,29
S04E06 The Dirty Girl.txt,Phoebe,"Pay the caterer! Look, I've had a lot of jobs, okay, and there are some people who just always try to get out of paying.

S08E01 I Do.txt,Monica,Maybe. I just hope she realizes how hard it’s gonna be.,43
S08E01 I Do.txt,Rachel,Maybe she hasn’t really thought it through that well.,43
S08E01 I Do.txt,Monica,"Well, there’s a lot to think about. I mean, how is she, how is she going to handle this financially? How is she going to juggle work? Does she realize she’s not going to have a date again for the next eighteen years?",43
S08E01 I Do.txt,Monica,Are you okay?,44

S08E01 I Do.txt,Phoebe,Calm down. Maybe you’re not pregnant.,50
S08E01 I Do.txt,Rachel,What?!,50
S08E01 I Do.txt,Phoebe,"When I got pregnant with the triplets, I took that test like three times just to make sure.",50
S08E01 I Do.txt,Monica,Yes! Maybe it’s a false positive. Are you sure you peed on the stick right?,50
S08E01 I Do.txt,Rachel,How many ways are there to do that?,50

S03E20 The Dollhouse.txt,Monica,"Wow, you’re really crazy about her, huh?",3
S03E20 The Dollhouse.txt,Joey,"Oh, you have no idea. And-and when we’re on stage I get to-to kiss her and-and touch her, but then she goes home with the director, and it’s like somebody’s ripping out my heart!",3
S03E20 The Dollhouse.txt,Phoebe,"Oh, it’s so great to see you feeling like this!",3

S03E20 The Dollhouse.txt,Phoebe,Really?! Really?!,5
S03E20 The Dollhouse.txt,Monica,"Any time you want. Y'know, when I was younger, all I wanted to do was to play with this dollhouse, but no!! It was to be looked at, but never played with.",5
S03E20 The Dollhouse.txt,Chandler,My Grandmother used to say that exact same thing to me.,5
S03E20 The Dollhouse.txt,Rachel,"Hey, Sophie!",6

S03E20 The Dollhouse.txt,Monica,Not one that can pee on the roof.,17
S03E20 The Dollhouse.txt,Phoebe,"Well, maybe it’s so big because the house was built on radioactive waste.",17
S03E20 The Dollhouse.txt,Phoebe,"No, no, that’s the ghost for the attic.",18
S03E20 The Dollhouse.txt,Monica,I don’t want a ghost.,18
S03E20 The Dollhouse.txt,Phoebe,"Well, nobody wants a ghost. But you’ve got one, because the house is sitting on an ancient Indian burial ground.",18
S03E20 The Dollhouse.txt,Ross,"Wait a minute, the house was built on radioactive waste, and an ancient Indian burial ground? That would never happen.",18
S03E20 The Dollhouse.txt,Phoebe,"Okay, obviously you don’t know much about the U.S. government.",18

S03E20 The Dollhouse.txt,Monica,"Okay, Phoebe, y'know what? That-that’s it, that’s it, all right? No dinosaurs, no ghosts, no giant dogs, okay? They’re not the right size, they’re not Victorian, and they just don’t go.",22
S03E20 The Dollhouse.txt,Ross,"Uh, Pheebs, while we’re hovering around the subject. I just have to say dinosaurs, they-they don’t go, rrroof!",23
S03E20 The Dollhouse.txt,Phoebe,The little ones do.,23

S03E20 The Dollhouse.txt,Rachel,Hmm.,39
S03E20 The Dollhouse.txt,Chandler,"Of course, I didn’t get to enjoy any of that, because Joanna’s such a big, dull dud!",39
S03E20 The Dollhouse.txt,Joanna,Chandler is fantastic!!,40
S03E20 The Dollhouse.txt,Rachel,What?!,40
S03E20 The Dollhouse.txt,Joanna,"Oh God, we just clicked! Y’know how people just click? Like he came by to pick me up, and I opened the door, and it was just like, click! Did he tell you?",40
S03E20 The Dollhouse.txt,Rachel,"Oh, I....",40

S03E20 The Dollhouse.txt,Joey,"Come on baby, don’t go. Please? What do you say?",41
S03E20 The Dollhouse.txt,Kate,He happens to be brilliant. Which is more than I can say for that sweater you’re dating.,44
S03E20 The Dollhouse.txt,Joey,"Hey, I’m not interested in her sweater! It’s what’s underneath her sweater that counts. And besides, since ah, since when do you care who I’m going out with?",44
S03E20 The Dollhouse.txt,Kate,"I don’t care. Why, do you want me to care?",44
S03E20 The Dollhouse.txt,Joey,Do you want me to want you to care?,44
S03E20 The Dollhouse.txt,Kate,Do you?,44

S03E20 The Dollhouse.txt,Joey,I don’t know.,53
S03E20 The Dollhouse.txt,Kate,"Well umm, maybe if it had more heat.",53
S03E20 The Dollhouse.txt,Joey,How do you mean?,53
S03E20 The Dollhouse.txt,Kate,"Well, Adrian’s looking for a reason to stay, right? Victor can’t just kiss her, he’s gotta, gotta really give her a reason, y'know?",53
S03E20 The Dollhouse.txt,Joey,Maybe he could slip her the tongue.,53
S03E20 The Dollhouse.txt,Kate,"Or maybe, maybe he could grab her, and, and, and, and lift her up.",53
S03E20 The Dollhouse.txt,Joey,"Yeah, yeah, and then Adrian, she maybe she could wrap her legs around his waist.",53
S03E20 The Dollhouse.txt,Kate,"And then she could rip off his shirt and kiss his chest, and, and his stomach!",53
S03E20 The Dollhouse.txt,Joey,"And then, then he could use his teeth, his teeth to undo her dress, and, and, and bite her!",53
S03E20 The Dollhouse.txt,Kate,"And then right, right when the scene ends, he could take her with this raw, animal....",53
S03E20 The Dollhouse.txt,Joey,Something like that?,54
S03E20 The Dollhouse.txt,Kate,"Yeah, that’s pretty much what I had in mind.",54
S03E20 The Dollhouse.txt,Joey,Yeah.,54
S03E20 The Dollhouse.txt,Ross,Hi.,56
S03E20 The Dollhouse.txt,Ross,Hi.,58

S03E20 The Dollhouse.txt,Monica,Oh my.,60
S03E20 The Dollhouse.txt,Rachel,"Ohh, gee. I wonder why she thinks you’re going to call her?",62
S03E20 The Dollhouse.txt,Chandler,That’s what you say at the end of a date.,62
S03E20 The Dollhouse.txt,Rachel,"You can’t just say, ‘Nice to meet you, good night?’",62
S03E20 The Dollhouse.txt,Chandler,"To her face? Look it’s the end of the date, I’m standing there, I know all she’s waiting for is for me to say ‘I’ll call her’ and it’s just y'know, comes out. I can’t help it, it’s a compulsion.",62
S03E20 The Dollhouse.txt,Monica,"Come on Rach, when a guy says he’s going to call, it doesn’t mean he’s going to call. Hasn’t it ever happened to you?",62
S03E20 The Dollhouse.txt,Rachel,"Well, they always called.",62
S03E20 The Dollhouse.txt,Monica,"Hmm, bite me.",62
S03E20 The Dollhouse.txt,Rachel,No. Sorry.,64
S03E20 The Dollhouse.txt,Joanna,Why?! Why?! He said he’d call. Why hasn’t he called?,64
S03E20 The Dollhouse.txt,Sophie,"Maybe he’s intimated by really smart, strong, successful women.",64
S03E20 The Dollhouse.txt,Joanna,"Sophie, would you please climb out of my butt. Why hasn’t he called, Rachel? Why?",64
S03E20 The Dollhouse.txt,Rachel,"Okay, okay. Umm, well ah, maybe he, maybe he feels awkward because you are my boss.",64
S03E20 The Dollhouse.txt,Joanna,Awkward? Why should he feel awkward?,64
S03E20 The Dollhouse.txt,Rachel,Well...,64
S03E20 The Dollhouse.txt,Joanna,"The only person that should feel awkward is you, and you didn’t tell him not to call me, did you?",64
S03E20 The Dollhouse.txt,Rachel,No. I...,64
S03E20 The Dollhouse.txt,Joanna,"Because if you feel uncomfortable with your friend dating someone you work for, there are always ways to fix...that.",64
S03E20 The Dollhouse.txt,Chandler,"Multiple, so many paper cuts.",66
S03E20 The Dollhouse.txt,Rachel,"Why hasn’t he called Rachel? Why? Why? I don’t understand. Why? He said he’ll call. Why? Why? Chandler I’m telling you she has flipped out, she’s gone crazy!",66
S03E20 The Dollhouse.txt,Rachel,"Come on, this isn’t funny. She thinks it’s my fault that you haven’t called her. You have to call her!",67
S03E20 The Dollhouse.txt,Chandler,"Look, you can’t call somebody after this long just to say, ‘In case you didn’t notice, I don’t like you!’",67
S03E20 The Dollhouse.txt,Rachel,Well then you’re going to have to take her out again.,67
S03E20 The Dollhouse.txt,Chandler,Nooo!! She’s really dull! And she gets this gross mascara goop thing in the corner of her eye!,67
S03E20 The Dollhouse.txt,Rachel,"I don’t care! I don’t care! You are going to have to take her out again and end it, and end it in way that she knows it’s actually ended. And, I don’t care how hard it is for you, do not tell her that you will call her again!",67
S03E20 The Dollhouse.txt,Chandler,"All right! Fine! But it’s just a lunch date, no more than an hour! And from now on I get my own dates, I don’t want you setting me up with anybody ever again!",67
S03E20 The Dollhouse.txt,Rachel,That’s fine!,67

S02E16 Joey Moves Out.txt,Joey,"Hey, why can't we use the same toothbrush, but we can use the same soap?",4

S02E16 Joey Moves Out.txt,Ross,"I don't know, I don't think mom and dad would mind. Remember when you were 9 and Richard was 30, how dad used to say, 'God I hope they get together.'",8
S02E16 Joey Moves Out.txt,Ross,"Alright, shall we?",9
S02E16 Joey Moves Out.txt,Monica,"OK, wait, wait, wait, wait. You know what? Ross, let's - let's switch places. You get in the middle. No un-, ya know, unless this looks like we're trying to cover something up.",9

S02E16 Joey Moves Out.txt,Rachel,"No. Well, yeah, maybe.",18
S02E16 Joey Moves Out.txt,Phoebe,"I don't believe this. Is this how this relationship's gonna work? Ross equals boss. I mean, c'mon what is this, 1922?",18
S02E16 Joey Moves Out.txt,Rachel,What's 1922?,18
S02E16 Joey Moves Out.txt,Phoebe,"Just, you know, long time ago. Well, when men used to tell women what to do - a lot. And then there was suffrage, which is a good thing but is sounds horrible. Do you want to get this tattoo?",18
S02E16 Joey Moves Out.txt,Rachel,"Yes I do, it's just that Ross is. . .",18
S02E16 Joey Moves Out.txt,Phoebe,"OK, hey, HEY. Is your boyfriend the boss of you?",18

S02E16 Joey Moves Out.txt,Chandler,What?,23
S02E16 Joey Moves Out.txt,Joey,"I'm sorry. I'm 28 years old, I've never lived alone, and I'm finally at a place where I've got enough money that I don't need a roommate anymore.",23
S02E16 Joey Moves Out.txt,Chandler,"Woah, woah, woah. I don't need a roommate either, OK? I can afford to live here by myself. Ya know, I may have to bring in somebody once a week to lick the silverware.",23
S02E16 Joey Moves Out.txt,Joey,"What're you gettin' so bent out of shape for, huh? It's not like we agreed to live together forever. We're not Bert and Ernie.",23
S02E16 Joey Moves Out.txt,Chandler,"Look, you know what? If this is the way you feel, then maybe you should take it.",23
S02E16 Joey Moves Out.txt,Joey,Well that's how I feel.,23
S02E16 Joey Moves Out.txt,Chandler,Well then maybe you should take it.,23
S02E16 Joey Moves Out.txt,Joey,Well then maybe I will.,23

S05E10 The Inappropriate Sister.txt,Joey,That part was perfect for me! I can't believe I didn't get it!,34
S05E10 The Inappropriate Sister.txt,Ross,"I'm sorry, man. Hey, y'know what you should do? You should make something happen for yourself. Y'know, like-like write a play. Write a movie! Huh? I mean, what about those Good Will Hunting guys?",34
S05E10 The Inappropriate Sister.txt,Joey,"Come on Ross be realistic, y'know? If I did write something, what are the chances I could get those guys to star in it?",34
S05E10 The Inappropriate Sister.txt,Joey,"Wait a second, I could star in it!",35
S05E10 The Inappropriate Sister.txt,Ross,Or that.,35
S05E10 The Inappropriate Sister.txt,Joey,"I can't write! Y'know I mean I-I-I'm an actor, I don't have the discipline that takes, y'know? I can't do it.",35
S05E10 The Inappropriate Sister.txt,Ross,"I'll help you. Yeah, I'll make up a schedule and make sure you stick to it. And plus, it'll give me something to do.",35
S05E10 The Inappropriate Sister.txt,Joey,Really? You'd-you'd do that for me?!,35

S05E10 The Inappropriate Sister.txt,Ross,And it can't be Joey.,36
S05E10 The Inappropriate Sister.txt,Joey,It's not.,36
S05E10 The Inappropriate Sister.txt,Ross,Or Joseph.,36
S05E10 The Inappropriate Sister.txt,Monica,"Hey, what's up?",38
S05E10 The Inappropriate Sister.txt,Rachel,I just saw Danny getting on the subway with a girl and he had his arm around her.,38
S05E10 The Inappropriate Sister.txt,Monica,"Oh, honey, I'm sorry.",38
S05E10 The Inappropriate Sister.txt,Rachel,"Well, you should be, this is all your fault! You meddled in our relationship!!",38
S05E10 The Inappropriate Sister.txt,Monica,You had no relationship!!,38
S05E10 The Inappropriate Sister.txt,Rachel,"No, but I was doing my thing and everything was going according to the plan!",38
S05E10 The Inappropriate Sister.txt,Monica,"Oh God, stop with the plan! So what, so what you saw him with a girl? Who cares?! That doesn't mean anything! Now look, you're going to go out on a date with Danny and you're going to be so charming he's gonna forget all about that stupid subway girl.",38
S05E10 The Inappropriate Sister.txt,Rachel,"She was kinda stupid. You're right. All right, I'm just gonna go on the date. I'm gonna go on the date. That is the new plan.",38
S05E10 The Inappropriate Sister.txt,Monica,"Come on, hurry!",39
S05E10 The Inappropriate Sister.txt,Joey,"Hey, how do you spell suspicious?",41
S05E10 The Inappropriate Sister.txt,Chandler,Why?,41
S05E10 The Inappropriate Sister.txt,Joey,Because I think this character is going to be suspicious about stuff.,41
S05E10 The Inappropriate Sister.txt,Chandler,"Yes! Chandler Bing, 7! Chandler Bing, 0.",42
S05E10 The Inappropriate Sister.txt,Joey,You're driving me crazy with that!,42
S05E10 The Inappropriate Sister.txt,Chandler,"Okay, I'll stop.",42
S05E10 The Inappropriate Sister.txt,Joey,Don’t stop! Move the bowl further away! Ross could make that shot!,42
S05E10 The Inappropriate Sister.txt,Joey,"Well, you suck! But at least you suck at a man's game now.",43
S05E10 The Inappropriate Sister.txt,Chandler,You wanna play?,43
S05E10 The Inappropriate Sister.txt,Joey,"Chandler, I can't be playing games, Ross is gonna be home soon. And I have to write five whole pages if I'm gonna stick to his schedule.",43
S05E10 The Inappropriate Sister.txt,Chandler,"Well, so, play for the next 30 minutes and then write until he gets home.",43
S05E10 The Inappropriate Sister.txt,Chandler,I'm intrigued.,44
S05E10 The Inappropriate Sister.txt,Joey,"All right, all we need is a little lighter fluid.",44
S05E10 The Inappropriate Sister.txt,Chandler,"Okay, but be careful okay, because I wanna get our security deposit back.",44
S05E10 The Inappropriate Sister.txt,Joey,"Yeah, I think we said good-bye to that when we invented hammer darts.",44

S05E10 The Inappropriate Sister.txt,Phoebe,"Thank you, Happy Holidays.",46
S05E10 The Inappropriate Sister.txt,Joey,"Yeah, that's the uh, game we were playing.",52
S05E10 The Inappropriate Sister.txt,Ross,This is helping your career?! Huh? I thought you wanted to be an actor not the creator of crazy lawsuit game!,53
S05E10 The Inappropriate Sister.txt,Joey,"You're right, you're right, I'll get back to work.",53
S05E10 The Inappropriate Sister.txt,Joey,Hey!,54
S05E10 The Inappropriate Sister.txt,Danny,I had a really nice time tonight.,57
S05E10 The Inappropriate Sister.txt,Rachel,So did I. I'm really glad Monica asked us out.,57
S05E10 The Inappropriate Sister.txt,Danny,"I'd love to ask you in, but uh, my sister's visiting and I think she's asleep on the couch.",58
S05E10 The Inappropriate Sister.txt,Danny,"Oh hey, great, you're up. Rachel, this is my sister Krista. Krista, this is Rachel.",60
S05E10 The Inappropriate Sister.txt,Rachel,Hi!,60
S05E10 The Inappropriate Sister.txt,Krista,"Nice to meet you. I wish you'd told me we were having company, I'd fix myself up!",60
S05E10 The Inappropriate Sister.txt,Danny,Like it would help.,60
S05E10 The Inappropriate Sister.txt,Danny,You are so dead! I'm gonna get you.,67
S05E10 The Inappropriate Sister.txt,Monica,No.,71
S05E10 The Inappropriate Sister.txt,Phoebe,Does it look like an ashtray?,71
S05E10 The Inappropriate Sister.txt,Monica,No.,71
S05E10 The Inappropriate Sister.txt,Phoebe,Does it look like a urinal?,71
S05E10 The Inappropriate Sister.txt,Ross,"So Pheebs, are you gonna go back out there or what?",72
S05E10 The Inappropriate Sister.txt,Phoebe,"Well, yeah! But I'm not gonna take anymore crap. Okay? No more Mrs. Nice Bucket!",72
S05E10 The Inappropriate Sister.txt,Monica,"Yeah, good for you. Y'know you're tough, you lived on the streets.",72
S05E10 The Inappropriate Sister.txt,Monica,Hey!,74
S05E10 The Inappropriate Sister.txt,Rachel,"Hey, umm, can I ask you guys something?",74
S05E10 The Inappropriate Sister.txt,Rachel,"Uh, I don't have any brothers so I don't know, but uh, did you guys wrestle?",74
S05E10 The Inappropriate Sister.txt,Ross,"Oh-oh, yeah.",74
S05E10 The Inappropriate Sister.txt,Monica,"All the time. In fact, I was undefeated.",74
S05E10 The Inappropriate Sister.txt,Ross,"Uh, you weighted 200 pounds.",74
S05E10 The Inappropriate Sister.txt,Monica,"Still, I was quick as a cat.",74
S05E10 The Inappropriate Sister.txt,Rachel,"Well, I met Danny's sister yesterday, and uh that was actually the girl on the subway.",74
S05E10 The Inappropriate Sister.txt,Monica,"Oh, you're kidding.",74
S05E10 The Inappropriate Sister.txt,Rachel,"Yeah, they were very y'know…wrestley. But, I guess that's normal?",74
S05E10 The Inappropriate Sister.txt,Ross,"Yeah, not since I got too strong for you.",75
S05E10 The Inappropriate Sister.txt,Monica,Too strong for me?,75
S05E10 The Inappropriate Sister.txt,Ross,Yeah.,75
S05E10 The Inappropriate Sister.txt,Monica,"You wanna go right now? 'Cause I'll take you right now, buddy! You wanna go?",75
S05E10 The Inappropriate Sister.txt,Ross,Oh fine.,75
S05E10 The Inappropriate Sister.txt,Ross,Joey's not going.,79
S05E10 The Inappropriate Sister.txt,Chandler,"Well, why can't you do them tomorrow?",80
S05E10 The Inappropriate Sister.txt,Ross,Because tomorrow he's redoing yesterday's pages.,80
S05E10 The Inappropriate Sister.txt,Joey,Yesterday's pages did not reflect my best work.,80
S05E10 The Inappropriate Sister.txt,Ross,"I think he's been relaxing enough, thanks to you and Fireball.",81
S05E10 The Inappropriate Sister.txt,Joey,"Dude, if you think Fireball's relaxing, you've obviously have never played.",81
S05E10 The Inappropriate Sister.txt,Chandler,"The only reason you're doing this to Joey is because you're bored. Okay, it's not his fault that you're unemployed.",81
S05E10 The Inappropriate Sister.txt,Ross,I am not unemployed. I'm on sabbatical!,81
S05E10 The Inappropriate Sister.txt,Joey,"Come on look guys, don't fight.",81
S05E10 The Inappropriate Sister.txt,Ross,"And the reason I'm doing this is because I am Joey's friend. And if you were a good friend, you'd be doing the same thing.",81
S05E10 The Inappropriate Sister.txt,Chandler,"Oh, so being a good friend means acting like a total jerk?",81
S05E10 The Inappropriate Sister.txt,Ross,If it does? Then you're an amazing friend of mine.,81
S05E10 The Inappropriate Sister.txt,Joey,"Hey-hey guys, hey! How about we settle this over a friendly game of Fireball? Huh? I'll go unhook the smoke detectors!",81
S05E10 The Inappropriate Sister.txt,Chandler,I paid for those tickets!,82
S05E10 The Inappropriate Sister.txt,Ross,"No you didn't. You said you would, but you never did!",82
S05E10 The Inappropriate Sister.txt,Joey,"Oh, y'know the same thing happened to me one time.",85
S05E10 The Inappropriate Sister.txt,Chandler,When did that happen to you?!,85
S05E10 The Inappropriate Sister.txt,Joey,Don't you remember when we were jogging in the park and we saw that really pretty bird and wanted to take a picture—I didn't have my camera!,85
S05E10 The Inappropriate Sister.txt,Chandler,"Oh yeah. First off all, chasing the Churo guy isn't jogging.",85
S05E10 The Inappropriate Sister.txt,Danny,"Oh, damn! I got it on my pants.",86
S05E10 The Inappropriate Sister.txt,Krista,We'd better take these pants off upstairs or that stain's gonna set.,87
S05E10 The Inappropriate Sister.txt,Rachel,"Oh, great!",88
S05E10 The Inappropriate Sister.txt,Monica,That was unbelievable!,89
S05E10 The Inappropriate Sister.txt,Rachel,"Okay, see? I told you!",89
S05E10 The Inappropriate Sister.txt,Joey,"Yeah, wow, sorry Rach.",89
S05E10 The Inappropriate Sister.txt,Chandler,I don't believe they're brother and sister.,89
S05E10 The Inappropriate Sister.txt,Joey,They're brother and sister!!!,89
S05E10 The Inappropriate Sister.txt,Bob,"Uh, Phoebe we've been getting complaints and uh, we're gonna move you to a less high-profile spot.",93
S05E10 The Inappropriate Sister.txt,Phoebe,What?!,93
S05E10 The Inappropriate Sister.txt,Bob,"Umm, Ginger's gonna take over this corner.",93
S05E10 The Inappropriate Sister.txt,Phoebe,That chick can't handle my corner.,93
S05E10 The Inappropriate Sister.txt,Bob,"Look, either you leave, or we remove you.",93
S05E10 The Inappropriate Sister.txt,Danny,"Oh, hey Rach! I thought we said seven?",95
S05E10 The Inappropriate Sister.txt,Rachel,"Yeah uh, y'know what uh, let's skip it.",95
S05E10 The Inappropriate Sister.txt,Danny,What?! Why?!,95
S05E10 The Inappropriate Sister.txt,Rachel,"Umm, you-you and your sister seem to have umm, a very special bond, and…",95
S05E10 The Inappropriate Sister.txt,Danny,Oh great! That special bond again! Why do women have such a problem with the fact that I'm close with my sister?,95
S05E10 The Inappropriate Sister.txt,Rachel,"Well, okay, look. I don't know, listen, I don't know what's going on here but let's…",95
S05E10 The Inappropriate Sister.txt,Danny,"Do-do you, do you have brothers?",95
S05E10 The Inappropriate Sister.txt,Rachel,"No, I have two sisters. But one of them has a very masculine energy.",95
S05E10 The Inappropriate Sister.txt,Danny,Are you close with them?,95
S05E10 The Inappropriate Sister.txt,Rachel,"No-no, they're not very nice people.",95
S05E10 The Inappropriate Sister.txt,Danny,"Okay, listen, I really like you. Okay? I think this can go somewhere. So what if I'm close to my family, are you gonna let that stand in the way of us?",95
S05E10 The Inappropriate Sister.txt,Rachel,"Well, uh, I-I don't know. See when-when you put it that way y'know it does sort of…",95
S05E10 The Inappropriate Sister.txt,Chandler,"Oh hey! There's some kids playing in the street, you wanna go down there and give them a project, ruin their day?",99
S05E10 The Inappropriate Sister.txt,Ross,"Hey, if they have a ball maybe you can stick razor blades in it and teach them a new game, Gonna Need Stitches Ball.",99
S05E10 The Inappropriate Sister.txt,Ross,Yay!,100
S05E10 The Inappropriate Sister.txt,Joey,"No dude, Ross tore up the tickets!",101
S05E10 The Inappropriate Sister.txt,Ross,"I guess when you don't have so many distractions, it's easier for you to focus. Huh?",101
S05E10 The Inappropriate Sister.txt,Chandler,Yeah or also when you don't have somebody breathing down your neck ALL THE LIVE LONG DAY!!,101
S05E10 The Inappropriate Sister.txt,Joey,"Yeah, well, that's fine, but the important thing is that I finished it. And uh, I think it's really good, but y'know it'd really help me is if I could hear it. So would you guys read it for me?",101
S05E10 The Inappropriate Sister.txt,Ross,Hey man.,105
S05E10 The Inappropriate Sister.txt,Chandler,What is up?,105
S05E10 The Inappropriate Sister.txt,Ross,"About yesterday, I was really wrong. I am sorry.",105
S05E10 The Inappropriate Sister.txt,Chandler,"No, it was me. I'm sorry. I over reacted.",105
S05E10 The Inappropriate Sister.txt,Joey,"Oh no! No-no, keep reading! The good part's coming up. Keep going.",109
S05E10 The Inappropriate Sister.txt,Chandler,"I am sorry, Ross.",110
S05E10 The Inappropriate Sister.txt,Chandler,This took you all day?!,111
S05E10 The Inappropriate Sister.txt,Monica,"Hi, how are you doing Kelly?",115
S05E10 The Inappropriate Sister.txt,Rachel,"I'm doing just fine! God, Tiffany, you smell so great!",115
S05E10 The Inappropriate Sister.txt,Monica,It's my new perfume. Why don't you come closer where you can really appreciate it?,115
S05E10 The Inappropriate Sister.txt,Rachel,"Oh, y'know Joey, you are sick!",116
S05E10 The Inappropriate Sister.txt,Monica,This is disgusting!,116
S05E10 The Inappropriate Sister.txt,Rachel,I'm not reading this!,117
S05E10 The Inappropriate Sister.txt,Joey,What?! Wait-wait-wait! The handsome man was about to enter!!,117
S09E14 The Blind Dates.txt,Joey,"Morning, roomie!",2
S09E14 The Blind Dates.txt,Rachel,Hey! You remembered to put clothes on this morning.,2
S09E14 The Blind Dates.txt,Joey,Fifth day's a charm.,2
S09E14 The Blind Dates.txt,Rachel,"Oh, Joey, it's so great to be back here. I gotta tell you, you're making it so easy on me and Emma.",2
S09E14 The Blind Dates.txt,Joey,"Hey, it's great having you back. You know, stay as long as you want, and when does she stop crying all night?",2
S09E14 The Blind Dates.txt,Ross,"Hey, you're not naked! So hey, Rach, when will we expect to see you tonight?",3
S09E14 The Blind Dates.txt,Rachel,"Well, I'll probably be back to pick her up around six, but she's in the bedroom all ready to go. But she did actually fall back to sleep, so...",3
S09E14 The Blind Dates.txt,Joey,She's probably exhausted from all that adorable screaming she did last night.,3
S09E14 The Blind Dates.txt,Rachel,Bye!,3
S09E14 The Blind Dates.txt,Ross,"Bye! Hey, I hope Emma isn't making it too hard on you.",4
S09E14 The Blind Dates.txt,Joey,"No, hey, it's been great.",4
S09E14 The Blind Dates.txt,Ross,Yeah?,4
S09E14 The Blind Dates.txt,Joey,"Yeah. And look, I just want you to know that with Rachel staying here and everything, all my feelings from before are totally over, okay? And even if they weren't, when you accidentally walk in on a woman using a breast pump...",4
S09E14 The Blind Dates.txt,Ross,"Yeah, that'll do it.",4
S09E14 The Blind Dates.txt,Joey,"Wow! So, how are you?",4
S09E14 The Blind Dates.txt,Ross,"I'm, I'm okay.",4
S09E14 The Blind Dates.txt,Joey,Really?,4
S09E14 The Blind Dates.txt,Ross,"Sure, I mean, do I wish me and Rachel living together would have worked out? Of course. You know, I'm disappointed, but it's not like it's a divorce.",4
S09E14 The Blind Dates.txt,Joey,"Well, actually it...",4
S09E14 The Blind Dates.txt,Ross,"No, it's not a divorce, it is not a divorce! Anyway, I think Rachel and I need to, you know, get on with our lives, maybe, maybe start seeing other people.",4
S09E14 The Blind Dates.txt,Joey,"Wow, really?",4
S09E14 The Blind Dates.txt,Ross,"Yeah, sure, why not? In fact, if you know anyone that would be good for me...",4
S09E14 The Blind Dates.txt,Joey,"Sure, I know lots of girls.",4
S09E14 The Blind Dates.txt,Ross,Yeah? Any names come to mind?,4
S09E14 The Blind Dates.txt,Joey,"Ooh, names?",4
S09E14 The Blind Dates.txt,Phoebe,Hey.,5
S09E14 The Blind Dates.txt,Joey,Hey. I was just gonna get something to eat. You want something?,5
S09E14 The Blind Dates.txt,Phoebe,What you got?,5
S09E14 The Blind Dates.txt,Phoebe,"Goodie! Thanks. So, how is it living with Rachel again? I mean, apart from the great food.",6
S09E14 The Blind Dates.txt,Joey,"I'm fine, I'm fine, it's just, it's just weird what's happening with her and Ross. You know, yesterday he asked me to fix him up with somebody.",6
S09E14 The Blind Dates.txt,Phoebe,"Oh my god, Rachel asked me if I knew anyone for her too.",6
S09E14 The Blind Dates.txt,Joey,Why are they doing this?,6
S09E14 The Blind Dates.txt,Phoebe,I don't know. They're so perfect for each other; it's crazy.,6
S09E14 The Blind Dates.txt,Joey,"You know what's crazy? These jars. What is it, like two bites in here?",6
S09E14 The Blind Dates.txt,Phoebe,I just wish they'd realise they should be together.,6
S09E14 The Blind Dates.txt,Joey,"I know, I know. And when they moved back in together, I figured y'know, that's where things were headed.",6
S09E14 The Blind Dates.txt,Phoebe,I know. They should be a family. They should get married and have more children.,6
S09E14 The Blind Dates.txt,Joey,"Yes, and they should name one of their kids Joey. I may not have kids; someone's gotta carry on the family name.",6
S09E14 The Blind Dates.txt,Phoebe,"You know what? Maybe once they start dating, and they see what's out there, they'll realise how good they are for each other.",6
S09E14 The Blind Dates.txt,Joey,"Yeah, because it is slim pickings. I had this date last night: Yuck! But we should probably keep it down; she's still in the bedroom.",6
S09E14 The Blind Dates.txt,Phoebe,"So, what are we gonna do? Are we just gonna go ahead and set them up with people?",6
S09E14 The Blind Dates.txt,Joey,I know; that just pushes them further and further apart.,6
S09E14 The Blind Dates.txt,Joey,"Ooh, that's a great plan!",7
S09E14 The Blind Dates.txt,Joey,"Shhh! Not so loud, we don't wanna wake up, uh...",9
S09E14 The Blind Dates.txt,Rachel,Hey!,11
S09E14 The Blind Dates.txt,Monica,Hey!,11
S09E14 The Blind Dates.txt,Rachel,"You guys aren't doing anything tonight, are you?",11
S09E14 The Blind Dates.txt,Chandler,"See, now, why would you assume that? Just because we're married? I will have you know that we are very hip, happening people. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to get back to reading the obituaries.",11
S09E14 The Blind Dates.txt,Rachel,I was just asking 'cause I need someone to watch Emma tonight.,11
S09E14 The Blind Dates.txt,Monica,"Sure, we'll do that. What are you up to?",11
S09E14 The Blind Dates.txt,Rachel,"Well, Phoebe set me up on a date.",11
S09E14 The Blind Dates.txt,Monica,Oh my god.,11
S09E14 The Blind Dates.txt,Chandler,Wow.,11
S09E14 The Blind Dates.txt,Rachel,Why? What's the big deal?,11
S09E14 The Blind Dates.txt,Monica,"Just figured, 'cause you and Ross are...",11
S09E14 The Blind Dates.txt,Rachel,"What, slept together a year and a half ago? Yeah, I'm all set.",11
S09E14 The Blind Dates.txt,Chandler,"Well, I think it's great that you're going on a date, you know? I mean, it sounds healthy. I mean, you have needs. Embrace your womanhood!",11
S09E14 The Blind Dates.txt,Monica,"You want a job? Turn off ""Oprah,"" and send out a resume!",11
S09E14 The Blind Dates.txt,Rachel,So I'll bring her by around seven? Is that okay?,11
S09E14 The Blind Dates.txt,Monica,"Oh, it's perfect.",11
S09E14 The Blind Dates.txt,Rachel,"Oh, you guys are gonna have so much fun! She's at such a cute age. Oh, a couple things. Now that she's eating solid food, she poops around the clock. And watch out for your hair, 'cause she likes to grab it. And oh, she's also in this phase where if you leave the room, she screams bloody murder, but ah... Thanks, you guys. Have fun!",11
S09E14 The Blind Dates.txt,Phoebe,"Ooh, Joey.",13
S09E14 The Blind Dates.txt,Joey,Hey.,13
S09E14 The Blind Dates.txt,Phoebe,Hey. I'm so excited; I just set up Rachel with the worst guy tonight.,13
S09E14 The Blind Dates.txt,Joey,All right! Who is he?,13
S09E14 The Blind Dates.txt,Phoebe,"Well, it's this guy I used to massage. And by massage, I mean hold down so he wouldn't turn over and flash me.",13
S09E14 The Blind Dates.txt,Phoebe,"Oh, yeah.",14
S09E14 The Blind Dates.txt,Joey,She's this really boring woman. She's a teacher!,15
S09E14 The Blind Dates.txt,Phoebe,A teacher?,15
S09E14 The Blind Dates.txt,Joey,"Yeah, yeah, she's really into history and foreign movies... And oh, oh, she loves puzzles. Huh? Come on, who loves puzzles?",15
S09E14 The Blind Dates.txt,Phoebe,"Well, Ross does. What... You're - you're ruining the plan! Joey, you've - you've fixed him up with his perfect woman!",15
S09E14 The Blind Dates.txt,Joey,"Oh my god, you're right!",15
S09E14 The Blind Dates.txt,Phoebe,Yeah.,15
S09E14 The Blind Dates.txt,Joey,She even reads for pleasure!,15
S09E14 The Blind Dates.txt,Phoebe,How do you even know a woman like that?,15
S09E14 The Blind Dates.txt,Joey,What? I'm not allowed to know smart women?,15

S09E14 The Blind Dates.txt,Joey,I met her at the library. I went in to pee.,15
S09E14 The Blind Dates.txt,Phoebe,So now what do we do?,15
S09E14 The Blind Dates.txt,Joey,"Well, okay, I'll - I'll just call her and tell her the date's cancelled, and find him somebody else.",15
S09E14 The Blind Dates.txt,Phoebe,"What if we don't find him somebody else? We'll just tell her the date's off, but we don't tell Ross, and he goes to the restaurant and gets stood up!",15
S09E14 The Blind Dates.txt,Joey,Ooh...I hear that's bad.,15
S09E14 The Blind Dates.txt,Phoebe,"Ooh, so this is great! Rachel's gonna have a terrible date, Ross gets stood up, and then they'll realise how good they have it together.",15
S09E14 The Blind Dates.txt,Joey,"Yeah, you know, it's not that fun.",18
S09E14 The Blind Dates.txt,Phoebe,"No, I think we killed it.",18
S09E14 The Blind Dates.txt,Chandler,"Emma? Emma? Look at me! Well, I think I'll go downstairs for a while.",19
S09E14 The Blind Dates.txt,Chandler,"No, no, no, no! No, no, no, no! It's okay, it's okay. I didn't go. Don't cry, it's just a bit! I'm your uncle Chandler; funny is all I have!",20
S09E14 The Blind Dates.txt,Monica,"Okay, just so you know, I'm gonna be ovulating from tomorrow until the sixth, so don't touch yourself in the next 48 hours.",21
S09E14 The Blind Dates.txt,Chandler,I don't do that.,21
S09E14 The Blind Dates.txt,Chandler,"I'll try to stop. Wait, did you say until the sixth?",22
S09E14 The Blind Dates.txt,Monica,Yeah.,22
S09E14 The Blind Dates.txt,Chandler,Today is the sixth.,22
S09E14 The Blind Dates.txt,Monica,"No, it's not.",22
S09E14 The Blind Dates.txt,Chandler,"Yes, it's also 2003.",23
S09E14 The Blind Dates.txt,Monica,Oh my god. Today's the sixth?! I may be done ovulating! I may have also served some very questionable meat at the restaurant.,23
S09E14 The Blind Dates.txt,Chandler,It's okay. Go take the test and see if we're okay.,23
S09E14 The Blind Dates.txt,Monica,Okay.,23
S09E14 The Blind Dates.txt,Chandler,Tough crib.,24
S09E14 The Blind Dates.txt,Monica,"Hey, where are all my ovulation-sticks? There's only one here.",24
S09E14 The Blind Dates.txt,Chandler,I might have checked to see if I was ovulating a couple times.,24
S09E14 The Blind Dates.txt,Monica,Chandler!,24
S09E14 The Blind Dates.txt,Chandler,I am not working. There's not much to do around here!,24
S09E14 The Blind Dates.txt,Ross,"Excuse me, is there a woman waiting at the bar? Someone average height, dark hair, perhaps doing a puzzle?",25
S09E14 The Blind Dates.txt,Waiter,"Uh, there's a drunk Chinese guy.",25
S09E14 The Blind Dates.txt,Ross,"Well, if I'm still here in an hour, buy him a drink on me.",25
S09E14 The Blind Dates.txt,Waiter,Can I get you another glass of wine?,25
S09E14 The Blind Dates.txt,Ross,"Nah, I don't know if I should. I don't wanna be drunk when I go home alone.",25
S09E14 The Blind Dates.txt,Waiter,"Got stood up, huh?",25
S09E14 The Blind Dates.txt,Ross,"Yeah, it's no big deal. It's just a blind date.",25
S09E14 The Blind Dates.txt,Waiter,"Are you worried your date came, saw you, and left?",25
S09E14 The Blind Dates.txt,Ross,No!,25
S09E14 The Blind Dates.txt,Monica,We're okay. I'm still ovulating.,27
S09E14 The Blind Dates.txt,Chandler,"Oh, good, because as of four o'clock this afternoon, I am not.",27
S09E14 The Blind Dates.txt,Monica,"So, let's do this.",27
S09E14 The Blind Dates.txt,Chandler,I - I don't think I can.,27
S09E14 The Blind Dates.txt,Monica,"Come on. I know you're not eighteen anymore, but give it a minute.",27
S09E14 The Blind Dates.txt,Chandler,Because of Emma.,27
S09E14 The Blind Dates.txt,Monica,"Oh my god, Emma. Oh, sweetie, I forgot you were here. Oh, you're right, we can't do this. We can't leave her alone.",27
S09E14 The Blind Dates.txt,Chandler,Sorry.,27
S09E14 The Blind Dates.txt,Monica,"Unless... Maybe we do it here. I mean, how much can she even be aware of at this age?",27
S09E14 The Blind Dates.txt,Chandler,"Well, she's aware when we leave the room. She may notice if we start... canoodling in it.",27
S09E14 The Blind Dates.txt,Monica,Canoodling?,27
S09E14 The Blind Dates.txt,Chandler,"Well, I can't say ""hump"" or ""screw"" in front of the B-A-B-Y.",27
S09E14 The Blind Dates.txt,Monica,"I don't know. I mean, I guess having sex in front of a baby isn't so...",27
S09E14 The Blind Dates.txt,Chandler,Horrifying? Scarring? Something people go to jail for?,27
S09E14 The Blind Dates.txt,Monica,I guess you're right.,27
S09E14 The Blind Dates.txt,Chandler,"You guess I'm right? When we stayed at that bed and breakfast, you wouldn't have sex with me because you thought a deer was staring through the window.",27
S09E14 The Blind Dates.txt,Monica,But what kind of a sick bastard wants to do it in front of a deer?,27
S09E14 The Blind Dates.txt,Rachel,"Wow, everything looks so good! I think I'm gonna have the chicken.",28
S09E14 The Blind Dates.txt,Rachel,"Oh, well, that's - that's very sweet. Thank you.",29
S09E14 The Blind Dates.txt,Steve,I'm kind of funny looking.,29
S09E14 The Blind Dates.txt,Rachel,What?,29
S09E14 The Blind Dates.txt,Steve,"Oh, come on, you're way out of my league. Everybody in here knows it. Bet that guy over there's probably saying, ""ooh, why she out with him? He must be rich!"" Well, I'm not!",29
S09E14 The Blind Dates.txt,Steve,"I'm not funny either. So, if you were thinking, ""well, he's not that good-looking, but maybe we'll have some laughs""... That ain't gonna happen.",30
S09E14 The Blind Dates.txt,Rachel,"Well, come on, Steve; let's not rule out nervous laughter. Hey, now wait a minute. Phoebe told me that - that you owned your own restaurant. That's impressive.",30
S09E14 The Blind Dates.txt,Steve,I lost it. To drugs.,30
S09E14 The Blind Dates.txt,Steve,I silk-screen t-shirts now.,31
S09E14 The Blind Dates.txt,Rachel,Really? What's that like?,31
S09E14 The Blind Dates.txt,Steve,"It's really fulfilling doing something you hate for no money. That's right. I have no money, I'm not funny, I live in a studio apartment with two other guys, and I'm pretty sure I'm infertile.",31
S09E14 The Blind Dates.txt,Steve,I do like my hair.,32
S09E14 The Blind Dates.txt,Rachel,Really?,32
S09E14 The Blind Dates.txt,Phoebe,Hello?,33
S09E14 The Blind Dates.txt,Rachel,"Phoebe, it's me. I'm going to hunt you down and kill you!",34
S09E14 The Blind Dates.txt,Phoebe,"Hey, Rach!",34
S09E14 The Blind Dates.txt,Rachel,This is the worst date ever. How could you set me up with this creep?,34
S09E14 The Blind Dates.txt,Phoebe,"You know, you are talking about one of my dear, dear friends.",34
S09E14 The Blind Dates.txt,Rachel,I don't care! This guy is a nightmare!,34
S09E14 The Blind Dates.txt,Phoebe,"Oh, right, so he gets a little crazy when he's stoned.",34
S09E14 The Blind Dates.txt,Rachel,He's not stoned.,34
S09E14 The Blind Dates.txt,Phoebe,Did he go out for a cigarette?,34
S09E14 The Blind Dates.txt,Rachel,"Yeah, four times.",34
S09E14 The Blind Dates.txt,Phoebe,"My dear, sweet Rach.",34
S09E14 The Blind Dates.txt,Joey,"Oh, great, pretty soon they'll be back together.",36
S09E14 The Blind Dates.txt,Monica,She's asleep. Chandler?,38
S09E14 The Blind Dates.txt,Monica,What are you doing?,39
S09E14 The Blind Dates.txt,Chandler,Emma was doing it!,39
S09E14 The Blind Dates.txt,Monica,She's asleep.,39
S09E14 The Blind Dates.txt,Chandler,"Ooh, she's asleep, that means we can...",39
S09E14 The Blind Dates.txt,Monica,"Yes, but we have to be fast.",39
S09E14 The Blind Dates.txt,Joey,Hello?,42
S09E14 The Blind Dates.txt,Joey,Emma? Hey! Hi!,43
S09E14 The Blind Dates.txt,Joey,"How are ya? How are ya? Where are your babysitters, huh? Why's the bedroom door closed?",44
S09E14 The Blind Dates.txt,Joey,"You can't have S-E-X, when you're taking care of the B-A-B-I-E!",45
S09E14 The Blind Dates.txt,Waiter,I've got bad news. The Chinese guy left.,47
S09E14 The Blind Dates.txt,Ross,"Eh, if it was meant to be, it's meant to be.",47
S09E14 The Blind Dates.txt,Waiter,"Look; you got stood up, who cares? We're gonna show you a good time. Just sit and relax. In fact, let me bring you a crab cake appetizer on the house.",47
S09E14 The Blind Dates.txt,Ross,"Wow, free crab cakes. Well, that's nice. Although I was hoping to have sex tonight.",47
S09E14 The Blind Dates.txt,Waiter,Ooh...,47
S09E14 The Blind Dates.txt,Ross,Just the crab cakes.,48
S09E14 The Blind Dates.txt,Waiter,"Just get out of here, okay?",49
S09E14 The Blind Dates.txt,Ross,What's - what's going on?,49
S09E14 The Blind Dates.txt,Waiter,"Eh, okay, the waiters have a little pool going. We have a bet on how long it'll take before you give up and go home.",49
S09E14 The Blind Dates.txt,Ross,What? You - you're making money off my misery?,49
S09E14 The Blind Dates.txt,Waiter,"Well, if you stay till 9:20, I am.",49
S09E14 The Blind Dates.txt,Ross,"This is unbelievable. I - I have never been so insulted in my life. Now, if you'll wrap up my free crab cakes, I'll be on my way.",49
S09E14 The Blind Dates.txt,Monica,"Well, that was weird. You were loud, and I was fast.",50
S09E14 The Blind Dates.txt,Chandler,I think we may have really done it this time.,50
S09E14 The Blind Dates.txt,Monica,"Oh, I wish I didn't have to wait to take a pregnancy test.",50
S09E14 The Blind Dates.txt,Chandler,You may wanna get some more of those too.,50
S09E14 The Blind Dates.txt,Chandler,Where's Emma?,51
S09E14 The Blind Dates.txt,Monica,"Oh my god, where's Emma? Where's Emma?",51
S09E14 The Blind Dates.txt,Chandler,"Don't ask me, I was in there canoodling you!",51
S09E14 The Blind Dates.txt,Monica,"Okay, okay, I'm sure that Rachel came home early and picked up Emma. You go look across the hall, and I'll call her cell.",51
S09E14 The Blind Dates.txt,Monica,"Hey, you better hope that we're pregnant, because one way or another, we're giving a baby back to Rachel.",52
S09E14 The Blind Dates.txt,Rachel,"No, no, no, I admire a man who can cry.",54
S09E14 The Blind Dates.txt,Steve,Really?,54
S09E14 The Blind Dates.txt,Rachel,Don't touch my coat!,55

S09E14 The Blind Dates.txt,Monica,"Oh my god, then...",59
S09E14 The Blind Dates.txt,Monica,"Oh, thank god! Emma, there you are!",60
S09E14 The Blind Dates.txt,Rachel,"What? What do you mean, ""there you are""? Where was she?",60
S09E14 The Blind Dates.txt,Monica,"Oh, we were playing ""peek-a-boo."" She just � she loves it when I'm dramatic.",60
S09E14 The Blind Dates.txt,Joey,Because you two were having sex!,62
S09E14 The Blind Dates.txt,Monica,"No, we weren't!",62
S09E14 The Blind Dates.txt,Chandler,"All right, all right, we were. We were trying to make a baby. Monica's ovulating.",63
S09E14 The Blind Dates.txt,Joey,Hey! It is unacceptable that you two would have sex with Emma in the next room. I'm gonna have to tell Rachel about this.,63
S09E14 The Blind Dates.txt,Chandler,"No, no, no.",64
S09E14 The Blind Dates.txt,Monica,"No, please don't. Please, Joey. She will kill us!",64
S09E14 The Blind Dates.txt,Joey,"Hey, I gotta! Unless...",64
S09E14 The Blind Dates.txt,Monica,Unless what?,64
S09E14 The Blind Dates.txt,Joey,Unless you name your firstborn child Joey.,64
S09E14 The Blind Dates.txt,Chandler,What? Why?,64
S09E14 The Blind Dates.txt,Joey,"Hey, I may never have kids, and somebody's gotta carry on my family name.",64
S09E14 The Blind Dates.txt,Chandler,Your family name is Tribbiani.,64
S09E14 The Blind Dates.txt,Rachel,"Well, uh...",67
S09E14 The Blind Dates.txt,Steve,"Look, I think I know the answer to this question, but... Would you like to make love to me?",67
S09E14 The Blind Dates.txt,Rachel,"Really, really not.",67
S09E14 The Blind Dates.txt,Steve,"Eh, it's just as well. Doesn't work anyway.",67
S09E14 The Blind Dates.txt,Rachel,"All right, well that's good to know. Good night, Steve.",67
S09E14 The Blind Dates.txt,Ross,"Hey, what's wrong?",68
S09E14 The Blind Dates.txt,Rachel,I just had a rough night.,68
S09E14 The Blind Dates.txt,Ross,Oh. Crab cake?,68
S09E14 The Blind Dates.txt,Rachel,Eww!,68
S09E14 The Blind Dates.txt,Ross,"Well, what happened?",68
S09E14 The Blind Dates.txt,Rachel,"Oh, well, I...It's kind of weird talking to you about this, but...",68
S09E14 The Blind Dates.txt,Ross,Monica told me you had a blind date.,68
S09E14 The Blind Dates.txt,Rachel,Yeah.,68
S09E14 The Blind Dates.txt,Ross,"I did, too.",68
S09E14 The Blind Dates.txt,Rachel,Oh.,68
S09E14 The Blind Dates.txt,Ross,But is it technically a date if the other person doesn't show up?,68
S09E14 The Blind Dates.txt,Rachel,"Oh, oh no. Do you think she walked in, saw you and left?",68
S09E14 The Blind Dates.txt,Ross,Why does everyone keep saying that?,68
S09E14 The Blind Dates.txt,Rachel,"Well, if it makes you feel any better, I wish my date hadn't shown up.",68
S09E14 The Blind Dates.txt,Ross,That bad?,68
S09E14 The Blind Dates.txt,Rachel,"Well, he makes t-shirts for a living, and he thought it would be appropriate to give me this.",68
S09E14 The Blind Dates.txt,Ross,Female body inspector? What size is that?,69
S09E14 The Blind Dates.txt,Phoebe,"Now, wait a minute. So, they're gonna name their first child Joey?",70
S09E14 The Blind Dates.txt,Joey,Uh-huh.,70
S09E14 The Blind Dates.txt,Phoebe,How - how do I get them to name the next one after me?,70
S09E14 The Blind Dates.txt,Joey,"It's easy, you just walk in on them having sex.",70
S09E14 The Blind Dates.txt,Phoebe,"Oh, so they owe me like, three Phoebes.",70
S09E14 The Blind Dates.txt,Phoebe,"Oh my god! Look, it's Ross and Rachel. Oh, the plan is working.",71
S09E14 The Blind Dates.txt,Phoebe,"Don't, don't do the plan-laugh.",72
S09E14 The Blind Dates.txt,Ross,"The first date we've had in months, and they were both such disasters.",73
S09E14 The Blind Dates.txt,Rachel,"Oh. Huh. You know, it is weird that Phoebe would set me up on a date that was awful on the same night that Joey set you up on a date that didn't even show.",73
S09E14 The Blind Dates.txt,Ross,"Wait a minute; you don't think it was intentional? I mean, that's just stupid.",73
S09E14 The Blind Dates.txt,Joey,"We're geniuses! Yeah, look at them, look at them, they're really bonding.",74
S09E14 The Blind Dates.txt,Phoebe,"Oh, yeah, they're falling in love all over again.",74

S09E14 The Blind Dates.txt,Joey,Can you believe they're still not here?,77
S09E14 The Blind Dates.txt,Ross,"I know. A double blind date, and we both get stood up. What are the chances?",77
S09E14 The Blind Dates.txt,Joey,"I know, I'm so bummed. Can we have our free crab cakes now?",77
S09E14 The Blind Dates.txt,Waiter,What?,77
S09E14 The Blind Dates.txt,Waiter,"Guys, give it a rest. Nobody's betting on you tonight. Although we do have a pool going to see how long it takes that guy to cry.",78
S09E14 The Blind Dates.txt,Steve,I have such fat hands!,79
S09E20 The Soap Opera Party.txt,Story,Shana Goldberg-Meehan,1

S09E20 The Soap Opera Party.txt,Monica,Yeah.,9
S09E20 The Soap Opera Party.txt,Rachel,Do you think it's possible for two friends to fool around and... and not have it be a big deal?,9
S09E20 The Soap Opera Party.txt,Monica,"No, I don't think it ever works. Why?",9
S09E20 The Soap Opera Party.txt,Rachel,No reason.,9

S10E12 Phoebes Wedding.txt,Joey,So he can't come?,3
S10E12 Phoebes Wedding.txt,Phoebe,"No, and so there's no one to walk me down the aisle and... well, I would just really love it if you would do it.",3
S10E12 Phoebes Wedding.txt,Joey,Seriously?,3

S10E12 Phoebes Wedding.txt,Joey,"Ah, our little ones are growing up fast, uh?",17

S10E12 Phoebes Wedding.txt,Joey,"Hey, I'm not that fond of you either, ok buddy? But I'm just trying to be nice for the kids!",17
S10E12 Phoebes Wedding.txt,Ross,"Yeah, I thought we'd be groomsmen, but wouldn't they have asked us by now? When did they ask you to be their bridesmaid?",19
S10E12 Phoebes Wedding.txt,Rachel,Uh... November?,19
S10E12 Phoebes Wedding.txt,Ross,I wanna say it's not looking good.,19

S10E12 Phoebes Wedding.txt,Chandler,What happened?,23
S10E12 Phoebes Wedding.txt,Ross,"Who cares, AND?",23
S10E12 Phoebes Wedding.txt,Ross,I'll do it!,24

S10E12 Phoebes Wedding.txt,Ross,"Please, you're going down!",28
S10E12 Phoebes Wedding.txt,Chandler,You are going downer!,28

S10E12 Phoebes Wedding.txt,Joey,"Strike three! You only get one more, Mike!",32
S10E12 Phoebes Wedding.txt,Ross,"So, what did you decide?",33
S10E12 Phoebes Wedding.txt,Phoebe,I decided to pee.,33
S10E12 Phoebes Wedding.txt,Chandler,Mike didn't tell you? You have to chose one of us to be in your wedding. One of his groomsmen fell out.,33
S10E12 Phoebes Wedding.txt,Phoebe,"Oh no, no. I can't choose between you two! I love you both so much!",33
S10E12 Phoebes Wedding.txt,Chandler,Just not enough to put us in the original wedding party.,33
S10E12 Phoebes Wedding.txt,Phoebe,"Well, there's a spot open for only one groomsman and you have to choose between Ross and Chandler. So good luck with that.",35
S10E12 Phoebes Wedding.txt,Rachel,"What, what, what, no, I don't wanna do that.",35
S10E12 Phoebes Wedding.txt,Phoebe,"All right, I guess I'll have to find a new bridesmaid.",35
S10E12 Phoebes Wedding.txt,Mike,Do I have a minute to go to the bathroom?,37

S10E12 Phoebes Wedding.txt,Joey,"Oh, man! I wouldn't have had breakfast if I knew there was going to be corsages!",44
S10E12 Phoebes Wedding.txt,Monica,"Hi. About last night... I know you are under a lot of stress and even though the things you said hurt me a little bit... My point is, uh, well, I'm willing to take my job back.",45

S10E12 Phoebes Wedding.txt,Phoebe,"Wow, this is a lot!",46
S10E12 Phoebes Wedding.txt,Monica,"Uh-huh, but I'm sure you can handle this. I mean, I have won awards for my organizational skills, but, uh, I'm sure you'll do fine.",46

S10E12 Phoebes Wedding.txt,Rachel,"Oh, Ross, c'mon, please! Don't make this harder than it already is!",48
S10E12 Phoebes Wedding.txt,Ross,I'm not! I'm making it easier! Pick me!,48
S10E12 Phoebes Wedding.txt,Rachel,"Well, Chandler said that it's really important to him too!",48
S10E12 Phoebes Wedding.txt,Ross,"Listen, listen. Whoever you pick is gonna walk down the aisle with you! Now, I promise I won't say a word, but if you pick Chandler he's gonna be whispering stupid jokes in your ear the whole time!",48
S10E12 Phoebes Wedding.txt,Rachel,"Oh, you are the lesser of two evils!",48
S10E12 Phoebes Wedding.txt,Phoebe,Sven I don't understand what you're saying! What is wrong with the flowers? Lorkins? What the hell are lorkins?,50

S10E12 Phoebes Wedding.txt,Mike,"Joey, I kinda have a lot to do today, what do you want?",57
S10E12 Phoebes Wedding.txt,Joey,"I want you to take this seriously! Phoebe is very very important to me, ok? And I wanna make sure that you are gonna take care of her.",57
S10E12 Phoebes Wedding.txt,Mike,That must have been one lousy movie.,59
S10E12 Phoebes Wedding.txt,Rachel,Hi,61
S10E12 Phoebes Wedding.txt,Chandler,"Hey, can I talk to you about this groomsman thing? If you pick Ross, he'll walk you down the isle just fine. But if you choose me, you'll be getting some comedy!",61
S10E12 Phoebes Wedding.txt,Rachel,"Even so, I think I'm gonna pick Ross.",61
S10E12 Phoebes Wedding.txt,Rachel,"All right fine, I pick you.",62

S05E21 The Ball.txt,Chandler,Me?! Why me?,13

S05E21 The Ball.txt,Ross,"Free cats do that too, y'know. {Which reminds me, if I might get a little political here, support your local animal shelter. Pet shops are not the place to buy dogs and cats from, you get a much better deal from the shelter, plus they probably won't die on you in a week and a half. If you want a leash, go to the pet shop. If you want the dog for that leash, go to the shelter and save it's life. Now back to regularly scheduled programming.}",23
S05E21 The Ball.txt,Joey,It's not a cat!,23

S05E21 The Ball.txt,Chandler,"I am trying to open your eyes, my man! Don't you see, if you lived with Phoebe she's always gonna be there. You're gonna get home, she's there. You go to bed, she's there. You wake up and oh yes, she's there!",33
S05E21 The Ball.txt,Gary,I know! I can't wait!,33
S05E21 The Ball.txt,Chandler,"Were you're parents happy, or something?",33
S05E21 The Ball.txt,Gary,"Listen Chandler, the way I see it is that I was lucky enough to find someone that I really love. I just—I wanna be around her as much as I can.",33
S05E21 The Ball.txt,Chandler,"Wow, y'know when you say it, it doesn't sound so scary.",33
S05E21 The Ball.txt,Gary,"So you know what I'm talking about, right?",33
S05E21 The Ball.txt,Chandler,"Yeah, I think I do! Y'know what? You move in with her! You move in with her right now! Maybe I should in with Monica!",33
S05E21 The Ball.txt,Gary,"No, it's too soon for you guys.",33

S05E21 The Ball.txt,Joey,Maybe this should be more of a quiet game.,35
S05E21 The Ball.txt,Joey,Hi!,36

S05E21 The Ball.txt,Ross,Yeah.,44
S05E21 The Ball.txt,Rachel,"You guys this cat is nothing like my grandmother's cat. I mean, it's not sweet, it's not cute, I even dragged that little string on the ground, and it just flipped out and scratched the hell out of me. And I swear, I know this sounds crazy, but every time this cat hisses at me I know it's saying, ""Rachel!""",44
S05E21 The Ball.txt,Ross,Doesn't sound as crazy as paying a thousand dollars for a cat.,44
S05E21 The Ball.txt,Rachel,"Well, I was gonna let you play with it.",45
S05E21 The Ball.txt,Chandler,Hi!,46
S05E21 The Ball.txt,Phoebe,"Hmm, did you talk to Gary about the moving in thing?",46

S05E21 The Ball.txt,Chandler,"He's a great guy, y'know? And he loves you a lot, you are a very lucky lady.",46

S05E21 The Ball.txt,Gary,Y'know I really want to move this relationship forward.,51
S05E21 The Ball.txt,Phoebe,Uh-hmm.,51
S05E21 The Ball.txt,Gary,"Because if you're not moving forward, y'know you're just moving backwards.",51
S05E21 The Ball.txt,Gary,Phoebe?,52

S05E21 The Ball.txt,Gary,I want you to move in with me.,52
S05E21 The Ball.txt,Phoebe,That is so sweet. But don't you think it's a little too soon? I mean there's so much we don't know about each other.,52
S05E21 The Ball.txt,Phoebe,I just—I don't want us to jump into something we're not ready for.,53
S05E21 The Ball.txt,Phoebe,I really don't want to mess up what we have. I'm just—I'm worried it's gonna be a big mistake.,54
S05E21 The Ball.txt,Phoebe,Which is why my answer is yes!,55
S05E21 The Ball.txt,Chandler,Four hours? You guys have been doing this for four hours?,59

S05E21 The Ball.txt,Ross,"It's really a uh-uh three person game, y'know?",61
S05E21 The Ball.txt,Chandler,It's throwing and catching!,61
S05E21 The Ball.txt,Joey,"Whoa-whoa you guys, it's not a cat!",64
S05E21 The Ball.txt,Monica,Oh my—Oh good God!,64
S05E21 The Ball.txt,Ross,"Baking it didn't help, huh?",65
S05E21 The Ball.txt,Monica,"So, why don't you just take it back to where you got it?",65
S05E21 The Ball.txt,Rachel,I tried! They won't take her back.,65
S05E21 The Ball.txt,Chandler,Maybe that's because she's a minion of the anti-Christ.,65
S05E21 The Ball.txt,Monica,"Rach, why won't they take it back?",65
S05E21 The Ball.txt,Rachel,"Well, they said would but they would only give me store credit. I mean, what am I going to do, get a thousand regular cats?",65
S05E21 The Ball.txt,Monica,"Look, if you want you can keep it at our place until you find out what to do with it.",65
S05E21 The Ball.txt,Chandler,"Yeah, you almost overreacted to something.",68

S05E21 The Ball.txt,Monica,So you're moving in with him. What happened?,70
S05E21 The Ball.txt,Phoebe,"I couldn't tell him no. He got so sad. Maybe it'll be all right. I do really like him a lot and probably do it eventually anyway and plus, think of all the money I'll save on stamps.",70
S05E21 The Ball.txt,Monica,"Why, do you write him a lot?",70
S05E21 The Ball.txt,Phoebe,"No, I just heard when people live together, they split the cost of stamps. Don't they?",70
S05E21 The Ball.txt,All,Yeah! That's right. Yeah-yeah! Yeah!,70
S05E21 The Ball.txt,Phoebe,"Oh, I'm sorry, the oven mitts really freaked me out.",71

S05E21 The Ball.txt,Gary,"Phoebe, can I talk to you for a second?",73
S05E21 The Ball.txt,Phoebe,Uh-huh!,73
S05E21 The Ball.txt,Gary,"So you uh, you checked the paper for listings in Brooklyn Heights, right? You-you checked the Post?",76
S05E21 The Ball.txt,Gary,In a minute. You-you checked today's Post?,77
S05E21 The Ball.txt,Phoebe,"Umm, yeah! Today's.",77
S05E21 The Ball.txt,Gary,Phoebe…,81
S05E21 The Ball.txt,Phoebe,Yeah?,81
S05E21 The Ball.txt,Gary,"Phoebe, it's okay that you feel this way. I mean it is soon. And there's a lot of things we don't know about each other, and I just figure that everything I really like. And the things I don't know, I get to learn about at someplace with both our names on the mailbox.",81
S05E21 The Ball.txt,Phoebe,That's so sweet.,81
S05E21 The Ball.txt,Gary,"Sweethart, but none of that matters if it's too soon for you. It's fine! We don't have to move in together. I just—I want you to be happy",81
S05E21 The Ball.txt,Phoebe,Living with you would make me happy.,81
S05E21 The Ball.txt,Gary,"Phoebe, you don't have to say that.",81
S05E21 The Ball.txt,Phoebe,"No, I really wanna live with you! I wanna move in with you!",81
S05E21 The Ball.txt,Gary,Are you sure?,81
S05E21 The Ball.txt,Gary,Oh that's great!,82
S05E21 The Ball.txt,Rachel,It's not a baby! It's a cat!,86

S05E21 The Ball.txt,Rachel,Yes! Thank you! Exactly! You want it?,89
S05E21 The Ball.txt,Rachel,"Oh, terrific! That'll be $2,000.",90
S05E21 The Ball.txt,Rachel,"Okay, a thousand.",90
S05E21 The Ball.txt,Rachel,"Well, I do, but you're just gonna have to actually look at this as more of an investment than a cat.",90
S05E21 The Ball.txt,Ross,I'm starving!,93
S05E21 The Ball.txt,Monica,Come on guys! Suck it up! We're closing in on ten hours! It's gut-check time!,93
S05E21 The Ball.txt,Monica,Please! I made this game what it is.,94

S05E21 The Ball.txt,Ross,I'm still hungry!,94
S05E21 The Ball.txt,Monica,"All right, there's some pizza at my place, we can all eat with one hand right? Are you with me?",94
S05E21 The Ball.txt,Ross,I am!,94
S05E21 The Ball.txt,Monica,Rachel! What is your cat doing in one of my bowls!,96
S05E21 The Ball.txt,Ross,"Oh, thank God!",97

S05E21 The Ball.txt,Gunther,Thanks Rachel. And-and don't forget you-you can come visit her anytime you want.,99
S05E21 The Ball.txt,Gary,I really like waking up with you.,102
S05E21 The Ball.txt,Gary,That would be great!,103
S05E21 The Ball.txt,Phoebe,We could have breakfast in bed…,103
S05E21 The Ball.txt,Gary,"Wait, just a second.",103
S05E21 The Ball.txt,Monica,"All right! Come on Monica! Look alive! Come on, look alive!",105
S05E21 The Ball.txt,Rachel,Phoebe! It's 6 o'clock in the morning! Why aren't you at Gary's?,106

S05E21 The Ball.txt,Phoebe,"Yeah. Yeah, I'll be alright.",106
S05E21 The Ball.txt,Monica,"It's okay. It's okay. Just pretend that it didn't happen! Okay? No one needs to know! I mean, Phoebe's not an official ballplayer! I mean, only official ballplayers can drop the ball!",108
S05E21 The Ball.txt,Rachel,"Phoebe, honey, wanna get some breakfast?",109
S05E21 The Ball.txt,Phoebe,Yeah!,109
S05E21 The Ball.txt,Chandler,You guys wanna eat here?,111
S05E21 The Ball.txt,All,Yeah! As long as we're here!,111
S05E21 The Ball.txt,Joey,Man that was great! Huh? Can you believe how long we threw that ball around?,112
S05E21 The Ball.txt,Rachel,"Yeah, it is amazing it lasted that long.",112
S05E21 The Ball.txt,Ross,I know. My arm is killing me.,112
S05E18 Rachel Smokes.txt,Joey,"Okay, pick a card.",2
S05E18 Rachel Smokes.txt,Chandler,Oh yes.,4
S05E18 Rachel Smokes.txt,Ross,Hi!,8
S05E18 Rachel Smokes.txt,Chandler,Hi there!,8

S05E18 Rachel Smokes.txt,Carol,Guess what? Ben is going to be in a TV commercial!,8
S05E18 Rachel Smokes.txt,Phoebe,What are you talking about?!,8
S05E18 Rachel Smokes.txt,Ross,"I know, it's crazy! We were just pushing Ben on the swings…",10
S05E18 Rachel Smokes.txt,Joey,I'm always on the swings! What am I doing wrong?!,10
S05E18 Rachel Smokes.txt,Chandler,That.,10
S05E18 Rachel Smokes.txt,Joey,Luck!,12
S05E18 Rachel Smokes.txt,Chandler,"Hey Rach, now that you're working at Ralph Lauren, can you bring me back some of those polo shirts?",12
S05E18 Rachel Smokes.txt,Rachel,"Uh well, y'know what? I don't think if I feel comfortable stealing on my very first day…",12
S05E18 Rachel Smokes.txt,Chandler,"Unwilling to steal from work, interesting.",12
S05E18 Rachel Smokes.txt,Monica,"Besides, if anybody's gonna get free stuff, it's gonna be me.",12
S05E18 Rachel Smokes.txt,Rachel,"Okay guys, way to wish me luck!",12
S05E18 Rachel Smokes.txt,Phoebe,"Okay, let's discuss Rachel's birthday. I say we throw a surprise party this weekend.",13
S05E18 Rachel Smokes.txt,Joey,"Whoa-whoa, but her birthday isn't like for another month.",13
S05E18 Rachel Smokes.txt,Phoebe,"Yeah but if we throw her a party on her birthday, then it's not a surprise.",13
S05E18 Rachel Smokes.txt,Monica,"I think it's a great idea. Yeah, we could have a dinner party and just invite her close friends.",13
S05E18 Rachel Smokes.txt,Joey,Ross!! We're having a surprise party for Rachel!!,13
S05E18 Rachel Smokes.txt,Joey,Done.,14
S05E18 Rachel Smokes.txt,Phoebe,"Okay, great so do you want to do it together?",14
S05E18 Rachel Smokes.txt,Monica,I would love to do it together!,14
S05E18 Rachel Smokes.txt,Joey,They're gonna do it together.,15
S05E18 Rachel Smokes.txt,Chandler,Dude! That's my girlfriend!,15
S05E18 Rachel Smokes.txt,Joey,"What, so I gotta shut it down now?",15
S05E18 Rachel Smokes.txt,Ross,"All right, I gotta take off. I'm picking up Ben then we're off to the big audition.",15
S05E18 Rachel Smokes.txt,Monica,It's gonna be weird to watch some actor pretending to be Ben's dad.,15
S05E18 Rachel Smokes.txt,Ross,Yeah.,15
S05E18 Rachel Smokes.txt,Joey,Whoa-whoa dad? There's a dad in the commercial?,16
S05E18 Rachel Smokes.txt,Ross,Yeah the dad and Ben eat soup and pretend to enjoy it.,16
S05E18 Rachel Smokes.txt,Joey,"Whoa, hey, maybe I'll go down there with ya and see if I can get an audition to play the dad. I mean who better to play Ben's father than his godfather.",16
S05E18 Rachel Smokes.txt,Ross,You're not his godfather.,16
S05E18 Rachel Smokes.txt,Joey,What?! Are you kidding?!,16
S05E18 Rachel Smokes.txt,Joey,All right!,17
S05E18 Rachel Smokes.txt,Joey,"Hey! I'm in, they're gonna let me audition!",19
S05E18 Rachel Smokes.txt,Ross,Really? That's great!,19
S05E18 Rachel Smokes.txt,Joey,"I know! I know! It turns out that one of the casting ladies has actually seen me in a play, so I steered clear of her…",19
S05E18 Rachel Smokes.txt,Joey,"Oh yeah, yeah! He's done tons of commercials. I've seen him in like Sugar Smacks, Playstation, and that one for the phone company. In fact he was so good in that one, he actually convinced me to switch phone companies. Chandler was mad….",20
S05E18 Rachel Smokes.txt,Joey,"That's great. Listen, wouldn't it be great though if I got to play Ben's dad?",21
S05E18 Rachel Smokes.txt,Ross,"Joey, you look nothing like Ben.",21
S05E18 Rachel Smokes.txt,Carol,"Y'know, I don't really know you well enough for you to do that.",22
S05E18 Rachel Smokes.txt,Kim,"So it's down to these two, Nancy I know you like this one and I think I agree. Rachel, what do you think?",23
S05E18 Rachel Smokes.txt,Kim,"Oh don't be sorry, that's part of your job here to give your opinions and then I take credit for them--I'm kidding.",24
S05E18 Rachel Smokes.txt,Nancy,"She is kidding, but don't ever disagree with her again. Okay, now I'm kidding!",24
S05E18 Rachel Smokes.txt,Kim,"I don't know which one, but I do know I need a cigarette. So what do you say we take a break, we go outside, and we'll figure this out when we come back?",25
S05E18 Rachel Smokes.txt,Rachel,…and then they came back from smoking and they had made all of the decisions without me!,29
S05E18 Rachel Smokes.txt,Monica,That doesn't seem fair.,29
S05E18 Rachel Smokes.txt,Rachel,"I know! It's like I'm being punished for not having this disgusting, poisoning habit!",29
S05E18 Rachel Smokes.txt,Chandler,"Yeah, it is the best.",29
S05E18 Rachel Smokes.txt,Rachel,"I mean what if this keeps happening? Y'know, they'll-they'll be outside smoking, making all the decisions and I'll just be up in my office breathing my stupid clean air, y'know? And then when the day comes when Kim wants to promote one of us, who do you think she's gonna pick? Me or Smokey Smokerson?",29
S05E18 Rachel Smokes.txt,Monica,"Rachel, you can go down there, you don't have to smoke. Just say you wanna get some fresh air.",29
S05E18 Rachel Smokes.txt,Rachel,"Yeah, I can do that.",29
S05E18 Rachel Smokes.txt,Chandler,"Yeah, or you can do the easy thing and smoke.",29
S05E18 Rachel Smokes.txt,Monica,Hey!,30
S05E18 Rachel Smokes.txt,Phoebe,"Hey Rach, you wanna get some coffee?",30
S05E18 Rachel Smokes.txt,Rachel,I would love to!,30
S05E18 Rachel Smokes.txt,Phoebe,Oh good!,30
S05E18 Rachel Smokes.txt,Chandler,"Yeah, I wanna go to babe.",30
S05E18 Rachel Smokes.txt,Phoebe,Oh good.,30
S05E18 Rachel Smokes.txt,Phoebe,"Oh, look at that.",33
S05E18 Rachel Smokes.txt,Monica,"All right, that's a little sketch of the cake, umm some sample menus, umm y'know what I thought we would start out with Tuscan style finger food, and for music, here's an alphabetized list of all my CDs! I've highlighted the ones that would go really good with the food.",33
S05E18 Rachel Smokes.txt,Phoebe,What happened to the intimate dinner party?,33
S05E18 Rachel Smokes.txt,Monica,"Oh, we're not doing that. Okay…",33
S05E18 Rachel Smokes.txt,Phoebe,"So wow, it looks like you took care of everything. Thanks a lot, co-host.",33
S05E18 Rachel Smokes.txt,Monica,"What?! I didn't take care of everything, there's-there's plenty of things for you to do!",33
S05E18 Rachel Smokes.txt,Phoebe,Like what?,33
S05E18 Rachel Smokes.txt,Phoebe,Cups? You're giving me cups?,34
S05E18 Rachel Smokes.txt,Monica,And ice!,34
S05E18 Rachel Smokes.txt,Monica,"Wait a minute, I can get ice at the restaurant…",35
S05E18 Rachel Smokes.txt,Phoebe,I got it! Mine!,35
S05E18 Rachel Smokes.txt,Monica,Hey! How'd the audition go?!,36
S05E18 Rachel Smokes.txt,Ross,Not so good.,36
S05E18 Rachel Smokes.txt,Monica,You got a callback too didn't you?,39
S05E18 Rachel Smokes.txt,Kim,"Hey Rachel, what are you doing out here?",41
S05E18 Rachel Smokes.txt,Rachel,"Oh well, it's kinda lonely up there, so I just thought I would come out here and get some fresh air.",41
S05E18 Rachel Smokes.txt,Kim,Nancy and I were talking about the fall collection.,41
S05E18 Rachel Smokes.txt,Rachel,Oh great!,41
S05E18 Rachel Smokes.txt,Nancy,"Oh, sorry!",42
S05E18 Rachel Smokes.txt,Rachel,Oh that's okay.,42
S05E18 Rachel Smokes.txt,Nancy,So anyway I sent the designs over to Ralph and he's very excited about the line.,43
S05E18 Rachel Smokes.txt,Kim,Oh that's great! You are the best!,43
S05E18 Rachel Smokes.txt,Nancy,I thought you didn't smoke.,45
S05E18 Rachel Smokes.txt,Rachel,"Oh, I thought you guys meant marijuana cigarettes, y'know? Y'know what I mean, like dubbies? And I actually, I thought to myself, ""Wow, those guys are crazy!"" But no, I actually smoke the regular ones all, all the time.",45
S05E18 Rachel Smokes.txt,Kim,We get high.,45
S05E18 Rachel Smokes.txt,Rachel,"Oh, me too.",45
S05E18 Rachel Smokes.txt,Kim,I'm kidding.,45
S05E18 Rachel Smokes.txt,Ross,"Oh God, this is so nerve wracking! How-how do you do this?",47
S05E18 Rachel Smokes.txt,Joey,"Well, unfortunately, I don't get many callbacks so…",47
S05E18 Rachel Smokes.txt,Carol,Is it a good sign that they asked us to hang around after the audition?,47
S05E18 Rachel Smokes.txt,Joey,Who knows?,47
S05E18 Rachel Smokes.txt,Joey,Oh this is great! I might actually get to play Ben's dad!,49
S05E18 Rachel Smokes.txt,Ross,Yeah!,49
S05E18 Rachel Smokes.txt,Joey,"Man, this is gonna be kinda weird.",50
S05E18 Rachel Smokes.txt,Ross,"Yeah, it is.",50
S05E18 Rachel Smokes.txt,Kyle,Yeah. It's gonna be weird.,50
S05E18 Rachel Smokes.txt,Ross,"No, we-we're gonna be like best friends, that's why it's gonna be weird.",50
S05E18 Rachel Smokes.txt,Kyle,"Oh, oh, I thought we were just talking.",50
S05E18 Rachel Smokes.txt,Phoebe,Is it okay if I leave this stuff here 'til Rachel's birthday party?,52
S05E18 Rachel Smokes.txt,Chandler,Ah sure. What's in 'em?,52
S05E18 Rachel Smokes.txt,Phoebe,"Umm, cups.",52
S05E18 Rachel Smokes.txt,Chandler,"Oh good, because uh we got Rachel 800 gallons of water.",52
S05E18 Rachel Smokes.txt,Ross,Seriously that's a lot of cups.,52
S05E18 Rachel Smokes.txt,Phoebe,"Yeah well, that's 'cause Monica put me in charge of cups and ice, and Monica is gonna rue the day that she put me in charge of cups and ice.",52
S05E18 Rachel Smokes.txt,Chandler,Y'know I rued the day once…didn't get a whole lot else done.,52
S05E18 Rachel Smokes.txt,Ross,Hey!,54
S05E18 Rachel Smokes.txt,Joey,"Ross good, I'm uh glad you're here. I wanna talk to you about something.",54
S05E18 Rachel Smokes.txt,Ross,What's up?,54
S05E18 Rachel Smokes.txt,Joey,"Well, I've been thinking about this whole commercial thing, y'know me going up against Ben, the two of us competing, and that can't lead to anything good. So, I think I'm just gonna step aside. I'm gonna tell them that I won't audition.",54
S05E18 Rachel Smokes.txt,Ross,"Wow, uh, Joey that's-that's great. Thanks man.",54
S05E18 Rachel Smokes.txt,Joey,That's it? You're-you're gonna let me do this?! This-this is my career we're talking about here!,54
S05E18 Rachel Smokes.txt,Ross,"Well, you just…",54
S05E18 Rachel Smokes.txt,Joey,"I just said that so you wouldn't let Ben do it! Look Ross, if anyone should step aside it should be Ben!",54
S05E18 Rachel Smokes.txt,Ross,What?!,54
S05E18 Rachel Smokes.txt,Joey,What? Chandler! Tell 'em!,54
S05E18 Rachel Smokes.txt,Ross,"Why should Ben step aside? It was his audition in the first place! You-you just tagged along! You're like the uh, tag-a-long dad.",55
S05E18 Rachel Smokes.txt,Joey,At least I care about his feelings!,55
S05E18 Rachel Smokes.txt,Ross,What?!,55
S05E18 Rachel Smokes.txt,Joey,Do you know how hard this is gonna be on him when he doesn’t get it?,55
S05E18 Rachel Smokes.txt,Ross,And why wouldn't he get it?,55
S05E18 Rachel Smokes.txt,Joey,"Oh, come on! Have you seen what my kid can do?! Huh?! I mean he dials phones! He-he-he eats tortilla chips! He-he plays soccer with the cartoon tiger!",55
S05E18 Rachel Smokes.txt,Ross,Are you saying your kid eats soup better than my kid?,55
S05E18 Rachel Smokes.txt,Joey,You just give him a spoon baby!,55
S05E18 Rachel Smokes.txt,Ross,Oh yeah? I guess we'll just see!,55
S05E18 Rachel Smokes.txt,Joey,Yeah! Because this commercial belongs to me and Mitch!,55
S05E18 Rachel Smokes.txt,Ross,You're kid's name is Raymond!,55
S05E18 Rachel Smokes.txt,Joey,Yeah?! So's yours!,55
S05E18 Rachel Smokes.txt,Rachel,"Oh it was great! It was great! I went down there just like you said, y'know? And we talked business. Kim totally took my opinions.",57
S05E18 Rachel Smokes.txt,Monica,You stink!,57
S05E18 Rachel Smokes.txt,Rachel,Thanks!,57
S05E18 Rachel Smokes.txt,Monica,"No, I'm-I'm serious!",57
S05E18 Rachel Smokes.txt,Rachel,Well-well that's 'cause I went down there and they were all smoking. This is actually the smell of success.,57
S05E18 Rachel Smokes.txt,Chandler,"Okay, there's something different though--Oh my God! You smoked!",57
S05E18 Rachel Smokes.txt,Rachel,I did not!,57
S05E18 Rachel Smokes.txt,Chandler,Yes you did! You look happy and sick; you smoked!,57
S05E18 Rachel Smokes.txt,Rachel,"All right, fine! But I had too! I had to do it for my career!",57
S05E18 Rachel Smokes.txt,Chandler,I wish I had smoked for my career…,57
S05E18 Rachel Smokes.txt,Monica,That's so gross!,57
S05E18 Rachel Smokes.txt,Rachel,"No well, no it's not that bad, y'know? I mean yeah, my tongue feels a little fuzzy and these fingers sort of smell, I actually feel like I can throw up.",57
S05E18 Rachel Smokes.txt,Chandler,"Okay, but you gotta push past this because it is about to get so good!",57
S05E18 Rachel Smokes.txt,Kim,"So, we're decided, no on plaid, yes on pink?",60
S05E18 Rachel Smokes.txt,Nancy,Absolutely!,60
S05E18 Rachel Smokes.txt,Kim,Rachel didn't you just light that?,61
S05E18 Rachel Smokes.txt,Nancy,I've actually been thinking about quitting lately.,62
S05E18 Rachel Smokes.txt,Nancy,Tell me about it!,63
S05E18 Rachel Smokes.txt,Rachel,Well then let's just quit! We'll just quit! Let's all quit!,63
S05E18 Rachel Smokes.txt,Kim,It does sound appealing.,63
S05E18 Rachel Smokes.txt,Nancy,"Oh, I never could do it.",63
S05E18 Rachel Smokes.txt,Rachel,Oh but you could. You can. Absolutely! We can help each other out! We can get--what are those--those patches! We could be like the Patch Sisters!,63
S05E18 Rachel Smokes.txt,Kim,"Oh y'know, we really should quit. Okay, let's quit!",63
S05E18 Rachel Smokes.txt,Carol,"Joey, Ross is gonna be here any second, would you mind watching Ben for me while I use the ladies' room?",68
S05E18 Rachel Smokes.txt,Joey,"Oh yeah, no problem.",68
S05E18 Rachel Smokes.txt,Joey,Hi!,75
S05E18 Rachel Smokes.txt,Joey,Uh-oh.,76

S05E18 Rachel Smokes.txt,Rachel,Come on you guys! What are doing?! I thought we were the patch sisters!,82
S05E18 Rachel Smokes.txt,Kim,Yeah. That didn't work out.,82
S05E18 Rachel Smokes.txt,Nancy,"Rachel we tried to quit, but it was too hard!",82
S05E18 Rachel Smokes.txt,Rachel,"Well y'know if you, if you started smoking again you could've at least told me! Come on, give me one of those! What are we talking about?",82
S05E18 Rachel Smokes.txt,Kim,No. No! You're doing great! Don’t you give up! That's why we didn't tell you and we're not gonna drag you down with us.,82
S05E18 Rachel Smokes.txt,Rachel,"Oh wait, no-no-no! Drag me down. Drag-drag me down.",82
S05E18 Rachel Smokes.txt,Kim,"Forget it Rachel! We're both so proud of how well you're doing. I'm not gonna let you blow it. In fact, if I catch you with a cigarette, you're fired. So go on, get out of here! Go on, I don't want you breathing this stuff! Go on!",82
S05E18 Rachel Smokes.txt,Chandler,"Great job with the cups, Pheebs!",87

S04E09 Theyre Going To Party.txt,Monica,"All right, that I’ll retract. But I stand by my review, I know food and that wasn’t it. You’re marinara sauce tasted like tomato juice! You should serve it with vodka and a piece of celery.",31

S04E09 Theyre Going To Party.txt,Monica,Oh my God! You own an Italian restaurant and you think that tastes good?! Where are you even from?,31

S04E09 Theyre Going To Party.txt,Rachel,Do you want me to quit?,37
S04E09 Theyre Going To Party.txt,Joanna,What?! What would make you think that?,37
S04E09 Theyre Going To Party.txt,Joanna,"Wait-wait-wait-wait! You can put your sad little muffin back in it’s drawer. If you must know the truth, I didn’t want to lose a perfectly good assistant.",38
S04E09 Theyre Going To Party.txt,Rachel,What?,38
S04E09 Theyre Going To Party.txt,Joanna,That’s why I said all those things about your flirting and your drinking…,38

S04E09 Theyre Going To Party.txt,Rachel,Say more things like that.,38
S04E09 Theyre Going To Party.txt,Joanna,"You can have your own office, and a raise! Effective tomorrow.",38
S04E09 Theyre Going To Party.txt,Rachel,I’d need an expense account.,38

S04E09 Theyre Going To Party.txt,Rachel,And an assistant.,38
S04E09 Theyre Going To Party.txt,Joey,Hey! What are you guys doing here? I thought you’d be out partying with Gandel-worf.,40

S04E09 Theyre Going To Party.txt,Chandler,And may-maybe we could end up on a boat again?,40
S04E09 Theyre Going To Party.txt,Chandler,All right!!,40
S04E09 Theyre Going To Party.txt,Chandler,"Remember that really cold morning, you woke up and those dogs were licking your face?",41
S04E09 Theyre Going To Party.txt,Ross,Yeah.,41

S04E09 Theyre Going To Party.txt,Rachel,"Hey, Pheebs, quick question for ya.",43
S04E09 Theyre Going To Party.txt,Phoebe,Yeah.,43
S04E09 Theyre Going To Party.txt,Rachel,How do you think this suit would look on an assistant buyer at Bloomingdale’s?,43
S04E09 Theyre Going To Party.txt,Rachel,Yes!!!,44
S04E09 Theyre Going To Party.txt,Monica,You got the job?! Why didn’t you tell me?,44
S04E09 Theyre Going To Party.txt,Phoebe,"Okay, is this the day of good news or what? I got us a job! The wedding reception.",45
S04E09 Theyre Going To Party.txt,Phoebe,But we’ve only had one job.,46

S04E09 Theyre Going To Party.txt,Phoebe,Yeah! What are you saying?,46
S04E09 Theyre Going To Party.txt,Monica,I got offered the head chef job at Allesandro’s.,46
S04E09 Theyre Going To Party.txt,Phoebe,What?,46
S04E09 Theyre Going To Party.txt,Monica,"It’s okay, ‘cause y'know what? You don’t really need me for the business.",46
S04E09 Theyre Going To Party.txt,Phoebe,You’re the cook! With out you it’s just me driving up to people’s houses with empty trays and asking for money!,46
S04E09 Theyre Going To Party.txt,Monica,"All right. But umm, I-I-I’ll pay you back all the money you invested, and you can keep the van.",46
S04E09 Theyre Going To Party.txt,Rachel,I’m an assistant buyer!!,48

S04E09 Theyre Going To Party.txt,Joey,"So, we’re having fun, right?",49
S04E09 Theyre Going To Party.txt,Joey,"We don’t need that wizard guy. We hit a couple of clubs, talked to some strangers, and uh, after this, we’ll head down to the docks and see about that boat thing.",49
S04E09 Theyre Going To Party.txt,Ross,I’m kinda beat.,49
S04E09 Theyre Going To Party.txt,Chandler,"Actually, me too.",49

S04E09 Theyre Going To Party.txt,Ross,"Yeah, me too.",49
S04E09 Theyre Going To Party.txt,Chandler,"Actually, can I get some hot water with a little lemon? I think I strained my voice screaming in there. Does it have to be so loud?",49
S04E09 Theyre Going To Party.txt,Joey,"I can’t hear a word you’re saying, my ears are ringing so bad.",49
S04E09 Theyre Going To Party.txt,Ross,"I’m just glad I brought that extra pair of socks, y’know? I used them as mittens, I didn’t want to touch a thing in that last place.",49
S04E09 Theyre Going To Party.txt,Ross,How sad are we?,50
S04E09 Theyre Going To Party.txt,Joey,"Yeah, I know.",50
S04E09 Theyre Going To Party.txt,Chandler,"Y’know what? We’re not sad, we’re not sad, we’re just not 21 anymore. Y’know? I’m 29 years old, damnit! And I want to sit in a comfortable chair, and watch television and go to bed at a reasonable hour!",50
S04E09 Theyre Going To Party.txt,Joey,Yeah! And I like to hang out in a quiet place where I can talk to my friends.,50
S04E09 Theyre Going To Party.txt,Ross,"And so what if I like to go home, throw on some Kenny G, and take a bath!",50
S04E09 Theyre Going To Party.txt,Joey,"We’re 29, we’re not women.",50
S04E09 Theyre Going To Party.txt,Phoebe,"Okay, I’m hearing.",52
S04E09 Theyre Going To Party.txt,Monica,"I’ve been doing a lot of thinking. A lot! And umm, well, I came up with a whole bunch of businesses you can do with your van. Okay umm, you could be flower delivery person.",52
S04E09 Theyre Going To Party.txt,Phoebe,What?!,52
S04E09 Theyre Going To Party.txt,Monica,Or! A bakery delivery person.,52
S04E09 Theyre Going To Party.txt,Phoebe,I wa-I wa-I wa…,52

S04E09 Theyre Going To Party.txt,Phoebe,Monica!,52
S04E09 Theyre Going To Party.txt,Monica,"All right, I’ve got a whole bunch of uh-uh, stuff in this area, but umm, I’m getting the feeling that you don’t want to deliver.",52
S04E09 Theyre Going To Party.txt,Phoebe,No.,52
S04E09 Theyre Going To Party.txt,Monica,"Okay. I’m guessing that if you don’t want to deliver, you probably don’t want to pick stuff up either.",52
S04E09 Theyre Going To Party.txt,Phoebe,No.,52
S04E09 Theyre Going To Party.txt,Monica,"Y’know what, let’s do the catering business.",52
S04E09 Theyre Going To Party.txt,Phoebe,Really?! Are you sure?,52

S04E09 Theyre Going To Party.txt,Monica,Really?!,53
S04E09 Theyre Going To Party.txt,Phoebe,"Yeah. That’s what you really want. Yeah, I don’t want to be the reason you’re unhappy, that would just make me unhappy, and I really don’t want to be the reason I’m unhappy.",53
S04E09 Theyre Going To Party.txt,Monica,Thank you.,53
S04E09 Theyre Going To Party.txt,Phoebe,"Besides, it might be kinda fun to form the new A-Team.",53
S04E09 Theyre Going To Party.txt,Rachel,"Oh, hi Mrs. Lynch! Is Joanna in already?",54
S04E09 Theyre Going To Party.txt,Rachel,Heard what?,54
S04E09 Theyre Going To Party.txt,Rachel,Oh my God! How?!,54
S04E09 Theyre Going To Party.txt,Rachel,"Oh my God! Oh, I cannot believe it!",54
S04E09 Theyre Going To Party.txt,Rachel,"Yes, so close. Mrs. Lynch, I know that this is an emotional and difficult time, for all of us. But by any chance did Joanna send any paperwork your way before… it happened.",55
S04E09 Theyre Going To Party.txt,Rachel,"Yes-yes, just a few seconds and she’d still be with us—nothing about an assistant buyer?",55
S04E09 Theyre Going To Party.txt,Rachel,"Oh, Sophie, I guess you didn’t hear about Joanna…",57
S04E09 Theyre Going To Party.txt,Allesandro,"I’m so excited about having Monica come on board with us. Although I do feel bad about having fired chef Emillio, it’s like losing a member of the family. Of course, that literally is the case for several of you. Tony, Carlos, Marie, please, tell your father how much we’re gonna miss him. Now, I know that Monica has a lot of great ideas for this place, well, you all read the review. So without much further ado, I present to you our new head chef.",59

S08E19 Joeys Interview.txt,Ross,Why’d you say no?,5
S08E19 Joeys Interview.txt,Joey,"Remember what happened the last time I did an interview for them? I said I write a lot of my own lines, and then the writers got mad and made my character fall down the elevator shaft. So who knows what I might say this time.",5
S08E19 Joeys Interview.txt,Rachel,"Oh, come on Joey! You will totally keep it in check this time, and plus y’know the publicity would be really good for your career! And you deserve that! And if you do the interview you can mention, oh I don’t know, gal pal Rachel Green?",6

S05E06 The Yeti.txt,Monica,What?!,3
S05E06 The Yeti.txt,Joey,"Look, just because I know about you two, doesn't mean I like looking at it.",3

S05E06 The Yeti.txt,Ross,"Oh, umm, I'm just getting rid of a couple of things.",15
S05E06 The Yeti.txt,Ross,"Yes, yes it is! No, but it's good it's—Emily thinks we should get all new stuff. Stuff that's just ours, together. Y'know brand new.",16
S05E06 The Yeti.txt,Monica,"So basically, this is a getting-rid-of-everything-Rachel-ever-used sale.",16
S05E06 The Yeti.txt,Ross,Touched. Used. Sat on. Sleep on.,16
S05E06 The Yeti.txt,Gunther,I'll take it all.,16
S05E06 The Yeti.txt,Joey,"Hey, Ross, you're okay with that?",16
S05E06 The Yeti.txt,Ross,"Look, if I can just do what Emily wants and get her to New York, I'm sure everything will be fine.",16
S05E06 The Yeti.txt,Chandler,"Okay, but don't you think this is a little extreme?",16
S05E06 The Yeti.txt,Ross,After what I did? Can you blame her?,16
S05E06 The Yeti.txt,Phoebe,"Oh my God! You got off easy! When my friend Silvie's husband said someone else's name in bed, she cursed him and turned his thingy green.",16
S05E06 The Yeti.txt,Monica,Now calm down Joey.,18
S05E06 The Yeti.txt,Joey,"No! Everything's gettin' all messed up, y'know? Emily won't let Ross see Rachel, we're not gonna stop seeing Rachel, hence Ross stops seeing us!",18
S05E06 The Yeti.txt,Phoebe,"Oh, I hate this. Everything's changing.",18
S05E06 The Yeti.txt,Chandler,"Yeah I know, we're losing Ross, Joey said hence…",18
S05E06 The Yeti.txt,Monica,"Look, I'm not happy about this either, but y'know if-if Ross says he's happy then we're just gonna have to keep our feelings about Emily to ourselves. Are you cool with that?",18
S05E06 The Yeti.txt,Joey,"No! But y'know, I'm an actor, I'll act cool.",18
S05E06 The Yeti.txt,Rachel,"Ohh, whoa God! Storage rooms give me the creeps! Monica, come on please hurry up honey! Please?",19

S05E06 The Yeti.txt,Chandler,You're on in 5 Ms. Minnelli.,27
S05E06 The Yeti.txt,Joey,What's the matter Ross?,28
S05E06 The Yeti.txt,Ross,"Nothing. Oh, actually, great news! I just got off the phone with Emily and it looks like I'm moving to a new apartment. Woo-hoo!",28
S05E06 The Yeti.txt,Phoebe,Why?,28
S05E06 The Yeti.txt,Ross,"Well, her thought is, and I agree, fresh new furniture, why not a fresh new apartment? Her cousin has this great place to sublet, it's got a view of the river on one side and Columbia on the other.",28
S05E06 The Yeti.txt,Chandler,So you're really okay with this?,29
S05E06 The Yeti.txt,Ross,"Yes! Yes! I mean it's-it's kinda far from work, but uh, y'know, I'll get so much done on the commute. I-I've been given the gift of time!",29
S05E06 The Yeti.txt,Chandler,"Now that's so funny, because last Christmas I got the gift of space. We should get them together and make a continuum.",29
S05E06 The Yeti.txt,Rachel,You guys! You guys!,32
S05E06 The Yeti.txt,Monica,"We were, we were just in the storage area and we saw this really creepy man!",32
S05E06 The Yeti.txt,Rachel,"It was like this crazy-eyed, hairy beast man! He was like a, like a bigfoot or a yeti or something!",32
S05E06 The Yeti.txt,Monica,"And he came at us with an axe, so Rachel had to use a bug bomb on him!",32
S05E06 The Yeti.txt,Joey,"Uhh, like dark hair, bushy beard?",33
S05E06 The Yeti.txt,Rachel,Yeah!,33
S05E06 The Yeti.txt,Joey,"Yeah, you fogged Danny.",33
S05E06 The Yeti.txt,Rachel,Please! We did not fog Danny! Who's Danny?,33
S05E06 The Yeti.txt,Joey,"Dan just moved in downstairs. Yeah, he just got back from like this four-month trek in the Andes. Nice fella.",33
S05E06 The Yeti.txt,Monica,"Oh he's nice. He's nice! Y'know, you always stick up for the people we fog!",33
S05E06 The Yeti.txt,Danny,Yeah?,34
S05E06 The Yeti.txt,Rachel,"Hi! You might not remember us, but we are the girls that fogged you.",34
S05E06 The Yeti.txt,Monica,We're-we're really sorry we fogged you.,34
S05E06 The Yeti.txt,Danny,Okay.,34
S05E06 The Yeti.txt,Rachel,"Hi! Just so you know, we-we didn't mean to fog you, we thought you were like a yeti or something.",35
S05E06 The Yeti.txt,Danny,Okay.,35
S05E06 The Yeti.txt,Danny,Yesss?,36
S05E06 The Yeti.txt,Rachel,"Hi! Sorry to bother you, but I don't think we can accept your acceptance of our apology, it just doesn't really seem like you mean it.",36
S05E06 The Yeti.txt,Monica,Yeah.,36
S05E06 The Yeti.txt,Danny,O-kay!,36
S05E06 The Yeti.txt,Monica,Wow! That guy is so rude!,37
S05E06 The Yeti.txt,Rachel,Really! What is with that guy? I mean you'd forgive me if I fogged you.,37
S05E06 The Yeti.txt,Monica,Well you did a little bit.,37
S05E06 The Yeti.txt,Rachel,"Oh my God, honey, I'm so sorry!",37
S05E06 The Yeti.txt,Monica,I totally forgive you!,37
S05E06 The Yeti.txt,Rachel,Really?,37
S05E06 The Yeti.txt,Monica,Yes!,37
S05E06 The Yeti.txt,Phoebe,Hey!,38
S05E06 The Yeti.txt,Monica,Hey!,38
S05E06 The Yeti.txt,Phoebe,"So listen, you know my friend Chris who owns the crematorium?",38
S05E06 The Yeti.txt,Monica,Crematorium Chris? Sure!,38
S05E06 The Yeti.txt,Phoebe,"He says, that he would cremate my fur coat for free if I umm, y'know, bring in the next person I know who dies.",38
S05E06 The Yeti.txt,Rachel,"Oh my God! Oh my God, look at these pelts!",39
S05E06 The Yeti.txt,Monica,"Don't get too attached, she's having it cremated.",39
S05E06 The Yeti.txt,Rachel,"What? Uhh, Phoebe, honey, honey, I know you're quirky and I get a big kick out of it, we all do actually, but if you destroy a coat like this that is like a crime against nature! Not nature, fashion!",39
S05E06 The Yeti.txt,Chandler,"Okay, what is in here? Rocks?",42
S05E06 The Yeti.txt,Ross,"No-no, this is my collection of fossil samples.",42
S05E06 The Yeti.txt,Chandler,"So, rocks.",42
S05E06 The Yeti.txt,Ross,"I loved this place! To tell you the truth, I wish I didn't have to move.",45
S05E06 The Yeti.txt,Joey,"Uhh, are you saying that you're not entirely happy about this?",45
S05E06 The Yeti.txt,Ross,"Well, I mean if uh, if Emily gave me a choice…",45
S05E06 The Yeti.txt,Joey,"You do have a choice!! Ross, why are you listening to her?! Are you, are you crazy?!",45
S05E06 The Yeti.txt,Ross,Why?,45
S05E06 The Yeti.txt,Ross,What's going on?,46
S05E06 The Yeti.txt,Joey,We all hate Emily!,46
S05E06 The Yeti.txt,Phoebe,Nooo!!,46
S05E06 The Yeti.txt,Monica,"No, Ross, we do not hate Emily. We-we just, we just think that you're having to sacrifice a whole lot to make her happy.",46
S05E06 The Yeti.txt,Joey,Yeah!,46
S05E06 The Yeti.txt,Chandler,"Look, we just think that maybe she's being a little unreasonable.",46
S05E06 The Yeti.txt,Joey,Yes! Yes! Unreasonable!,46
S05E06 The Yeti.txt,Phoebe,I think he's right. You guys hang out at the coffeehouse way too much.,47
S05E06 The Yeti.txt,Monica,"God, I feel so guilty about Ross.",48
S05E06 The Yeti.txt,Phoebe,"Oh, I know.",48
S05E06 The Yeti.txt,Joey,I kinda feel like it's my fault.,48
S05E06 The Yeti.txt,Chandler,Kind of? If you just kept this to yourself none of this would've happened.,49
S05E06 The Yeti.txt,Chandler,"Well, I think it's very brave what you said.",50
S05E06 The Yeti.txt,Chandler,"Pheebs, what are you doing with the coat? How about the whole animal rights thing?",52
S05E06 The Yeti.txt,Rachel,Hi!,54
S05E06 The Yeti.txt,Danny,So you like the short hair better.,54
S05E06 The Yeti.txt,Rachel,What? Yeti—I mean Danny?,54
S05E06 The Yeti.txt,Danny,"I had to cut my hair to get rid of the uh, fogger smell.",54
S05E06 The Yeti.txt,Rachel,"Oh. Listen, I'm so sorry. I would, I would've never fogged you if y'know if you hadn't looked so…. Y'know.",54
S05E06 The Yeti.txt,Danny,Absolutely. Some people are just into appearances.,54
S05E06 The Yeti.txt,Rachel,What? Hey! No-no-no! This not cool! You don't even know me!,56
S05E06 The Yeti.txt,Danny,"Come on, you got the shopping bags and the Sack's catalog.",56
S05E06 The Yeti.txt,Rachel,"So from that you think you've got me all figured out? Well, you don't! Y'know I-I could have toys for underprivileged kids in here!",56
S05E06 The Yeti.txt,Danny,Do you?,56
S05E06 The Yeti.txt,Rachel,"Well, y'know, if-if kids like to play with Capri pants.",56
S05E06 The Yeti.txt,Rachel,And stop saying that! I hate that!,57
S05E06 The Yeti.txt,Danny,Okay!,57
S05E06 The Yeti.txt,Rachel,Fine! I judged you. I made a snap judgement. But you did it too! And you are worse because you are sticking to your stupid snap judgement! You can't even open up your mind for a second to see if you're wrong! What does that say about you?,58
S05E06 The Yeti.txt,Danny,The pizza-place across the street any good?,58
S05E06 The Yeti.txt,Rachel,What?!,58
S05E06 The Yeti.txt,Danny,I'm hungry. Wanna get some pizza? You can keep yelling if there's more.,58
S05E06 The Yeti.txt,Rachel,Okay. Okay.,58

S08E12 Joey Dates Rachel.txt,Joey,"You sure are naming a lot of ways to postpone sex, I’ll tell ya…",7
S08E12 Joey Dates Rachel.txt,Rachel,"Ooh, I miss dating. Gettin’ all dressed up and going to a fancy restaurant. I’m not gonna be able to do that for so long, and it’s so much fun! I mean not that sitting at home worrying about giving birth to a sixteen pound baby is not fun.",7
S08E12 Joey Dates Rachel.txt,Joey,"Hey, y’know what?",7
S08E12 Joey Dates Rachel.txt,Rachel,Huh?,7
S08E12 Joey Dates Rachel.txt,Joey,Why don’t I take you out?,7

S08E12 Joey Dates Rachel.txt,Chandler,Who cares? It’s a stupid game.,10
S08E12 Joey Dates Rachel.txt,Monica,You only think it’s stupid because you suck at it.,10
S08E12 Joey Dates Rachel.txt,Chandler,I don’t suck. It’s sucks. You suck.,10
S08E12 Joey Dates Rachel.txt,Phoebe,"Wait okay, if this game is gonna cause problems between the two of you, then maybe I should just keep it.",10
S08E12 Joey Dates Rachel.txt,Monica,"No! No-no! I love it! It is a great present! In fact, why don’t you go home and wait for the thank you card?",10
S08E12 Joey Dates Rachel.txt,Chandler,Why do you want to play this game so bad?,10
S08E12 Joey Dates Rachel.txt,Phoebe,Yeah! It’s not like it spits out a Clark bar after every game.,10
S08E12 Joey Dates Rachel.txt,Rachel,"Ohh, Lilies. Joey, they’re my favorite. Thank you.",14

S08E12 Joey Dates Rachel.txt,Rachel,Hm-mmm.,16
S08E12 Joey Dates Rachel.txt,Joey,"Oh yeah, it must be tough to keep your hands of him, huh?",16

S08E12 Joey Dates Rachel.txt,Joey,"Oh alright. Umm, well, okay, I usually start by having a bottle of wine sent to my table from a fan.",25
S08E12 Joey Dates Rachel.txt,Rachel,Oh my God. And that works?!,25
S08E12 Joey Dates Rachel.txt,Joey,"Well it does when you combine it with, ""This is so embarrassing, I just want to have a normal life!""",25
S08E12 Joey Dates Rachel.txt,Rachel,"Oh, you poor little famous man.",25
S08E12 Joey Dates Rachel.txt,Joey,"Oh okay, how about this one. I was gonna wait until the end of the night to kiss you, but you’re so beautiful…I don’t think I can.",25
S08E12 Joey Dates Rachel.txt,Joey,"Alright, so…so tell me one of your moves.",26
S08E12 Joey Dates Rachel.txt,Rachel,Alright. So where’d you grow up?,26

S08E12 Joey Dates Rachel.txt,Rachel,Why not?,27
S08E12 Joey Dates Rachel.txt,Joey,"I don’t know. I guess there’s just always been this distance y’know—I mean we both try to pretend it’s not there, but it is.",27
S08E12 Joey Dates Rachel.txt,Joey,"Yeah, it is. It’s really tough. Y’know sometimes I think—Wow!! Nice move!",28
S08E12 Joey Dates Rachel.txt,Rachel,Huh?,28
S08E12 Joey Dates Rachel.txt,Joey,"""Where’d you grow up,"" it’s so simple!",28

S08E12 Joey Dates Rachel.txt,Chandler,You are not going to believe what I did today!,30
S08E12 Joey Dates Rachel.txt,Monica,Well it clearly wasn’t showering or shaving.,30
S08E12 Joey Dates Rachel.txt,Monica,"Wait a minute, you stayed home all day and played Ms. Pac-Man while I went off to work like some kind of chump?!",31
S08E12 Joey Dates Rachel.txt,Monica,What is the matter with your hand?,32
S08E12 Joey Dates Rachel.txt,Chandler,"Well I’ve been playing it for like eight hours, it’ll loosen up. Come on, check out the scores. Oh, and also look at the initials, they’re dirty words.",32
S08E12 Joey Dates Rachel.txt,Monica,"Chandler, why would you do that?",32
S08E12 Joey Dates Rachel.txt,Chandler,Because it’s awesome.,32
S08E12 Joey Dates Rachel.txt,Monica,You think this is clever?,32
S08E12 Joey Dates Rachel.txt,Chandler,"Well y’know, they only give you three letters, so after A-S-S it is a bit of a challenge.",32
S08E12 Joey Dates Rachel.txt,Monica,"Hey wait a minute, this one isn’t dirty.",32
S08E12 Joey Dates Rachel.txt,Chandler,It is when you put it together with that one.,32
S08E12 Joey Dates Rachel.txt,Monica,"Ah, well if you don’t clear this off, you won’t be getting one of those from me. But Ben’s coming over here tomorrow to play this game, this can’t be there.",32
S08E12 Joey Dates Rachel.txt,Chandler,"Come on, he won’t even know what they mean.",32
S08E12 Joey Dates Rachel.txt,Monica,Chandler! He’s seven; he’s not stupid.,32
S08E12 Joey Dates Rachel.txt,Chandler,Have you talked to him lately?,32
S08E12 Joey Dates Rachel.txt,Monica,"All right, look I’m just gonna unplug it.",32
S08E12 Joey Dates Rachel.txt,Monica,Honey you-you got to beat your scores!,33
S08E12 Joey Dates Rachel.txt,Chandler,With the claw?!,33
S08E12 Joey Dates Rachel.txt,Monica,"All right fine. Fine, I’ll do it. I’ve just got to get this off the screen. Carol and Susan are still upset that you taught him pull my finger.",33
S08E12 Joey Dates Rachel.txt,Rachel,I am not gonna answer that!,35
S08E12 Joey Dates Rachel.txt,Joey,"Oh come on! Just pick one! Between Monica, Phoebe, Chandler, and Ross if you had to, if you had to, who would you punch?",35
S08E12 Joey Dates Rachel.txt,Rachel,"No one! They are my friends, I wouldn’t punch any of them.",35
S08E12 Joey Dates Rachel.txt,Joey,Chandler?,35
S08E12 Joey Dates Rachel.txt,Rachel,"Yeah, but I don’t know why. Look at me, I’m having such a wonderful time!",35
S08E12 Joey Dates Rachel.txt,Joey,"Me too! Hey Rach, can I just say I think this is the best date I ever had!",35
S08E12 Joey Dates Rachel.txt,Rachel,I know!,35
S08E12 Joey Dates Rachel.txt,Joey,I never laughed so hard—Did you see the wine come out of my nose?,35
S08E12 Joey Dates Rachel.txt,Rachel,"Joey, I think everyone saw the wine come out of your nose.",35
S08E12 Joey Dates Rachel.txt,Joey,"I gotta say, I never knew I could enjoy the non-sex part of the date so much.",35
S08E12 Joey Dates Rachel.txt,Rachel,Well that is because you have never been on a date with me before.,35
S08E12 Joey Dates Rachel.txt,Joey,Huh. Huh.,35
S08E12 Joey Dates Rachel.txt,Rachel,"All right, now don’t judge me. I normally wait until my date leaves, but you live here. I’m ripping into this swan.",35
S08E12 Joey Dates Rachel.txt,Rachel,"So tell me, what are Joey Tribbiani’s end of the night moves?",36
S08E12 Joey Dates Rachel.txt,Joey,"Ah, well, if I want the girl to kiss me, first thing I do is make my lips look irresistible.",36
S08E12 Joey Dates Rachel.txt,Rachel,How do you do that?,36
S08E12 Joey Dates Rachel.txt,Joey,"Now you can’t tell anyone, but uh…I put on shiny lip balm.",36
S08E12 Joey Dates Rachel.txt,Rachel,Oh my God!,36
S08E12 Joey Dates Rachel.txt,Joey,"Yeah, like a moth to a flame, I’m telling ya. Okay all right, so now you go.",36
S08E12 Joey Dates Rachel.txt,Rachel,"No, I don’t want to tell you.",36
S08E12 Joey Dates Rachel.txt,Joey,Why not?,36
S08E12 Joey Dates Rachel.txt,Rachel,Because it’s embarrassing.,36
S08E12 Joey Dates Rachel.txt,Rachel,"All right, I gotta go to bed. Honey, I had such a wonderful time.",39
S08E12 Joey Dates Rachel.txt,Rachel,"…you were 50 minutes late to the class, what did you crawl there?!",41
S08E12 Joey Dates Rachel.txt,Ross,"No, I ran. It was really far, and when did people stop understanding the phrase, ""Get the hell out of my way!""",41
S08E12 Joey Dates Rachel.txt,Rachel,"Well, why didn’t you just take a cab?",41
S08E12 Joey Dates Rachel.txt,Ross,"Ugh, between the traffic that time of day and all the one-way streets it’ll take me twice as long. Besides, I teach the class three times a week, who am I? Rockefeller?",41
S08E12 Joey Dates Rachel.txt,Rachel,Well you’re not gonna be able to keep doing this.,41
S08E12 Joey Dates Rachel.txt,Ross,"Well I have to. Okay? If I don’t, they’ll take the class away from me. And…I already put it in my family newsletter.",41
S08E12 Joey Dates Rachel.txt,Rachel,You what?,41
S08E12 Joey Dates Rachel.txt,Ross,"You’ve seen it, the Geller Yeller.",41
S08E12 Joey Dates Rachel.txt,Rachel,Right. Wow!,41

S08E12 Joey Dates Rachel.txt,Joey,"Oh yeah, I still can’t believe you haven’t seen Cujo. What is wrong with you?",42
S08E12 Joey Dates Rachel.txt,Rachel,Relax! It’s not like it’s Citizen Kane!,42
S08E12 Joey Dates Rachel.txt,Joey,Have you ever tried to sit through Citizen Kane?,42
S08E12 Joey Dates Rachel.txt,Rachel,"Yeah I know it’s really boring, but it’s like a big deal. Anyway, I was thinking about renting Cujo sometime.",42
S08E12 Joey Dates Rachel.txt,Joey,"Oh yeah? All right, let’s do it tonight.",42
S08E12 Joey Dates Rachel.txt,Rachel,Well don’t you have that big date tonight?,42

S08E12 Joey Dates Rachel.txt,Monica,They’re all Chandler.,46
S08E12 Joey Dates Rachel.txt,Phoebe,Chandler sucks! He couldn’t have gotten this good!,46
S08E12 Joey Dates Rachel.txt,Monica,But Ben is coming over tonight and he can’t see this.,47
S08E12 Joey Dates Rachel.txt,Joey,"No-no! I’m fine. It’s just… Hey, can I ask you something? Have you ever looked at someone that you’ve known for a while and then suddenly…suddenly see them a different way?",51
S08E12 Joey Dates Rachel.txt,Joey,"Yeah. Yeah, that…that’s exactly it. You’re right. Yeah.",51
S08E12 Joey Dates Rachel.txt,Monica,"Oh my God Phoebe, you’re on fire!",55

S08E21 The Cooking Class.txt,Phoebe,"Well that’s no way to sell newspapers. Why don’t you try, ""Extra! Extra! Read all about it!""",3
S08E21 The Cooking Class.txt,Chandler,Hey.,6
S08E21 The Cooking Class.txt,Ross,Umm…,7
S08E21 The Cooking Class.txt,Ross,"But the good news is, no one in a two-block radius will ever know.",8

S08E21 The Cooking Class.txt,Rachel,I don’t want you to date her!,73
S08E21 The Cooking Class.txt,Rachel,"Yes! And not because I want you to go out with me, but because I don’t want you to go out with anybody! Okay?

S10E14 Princess Consuela.txt,Joey,"What? No, the only reason I'm going to their stupid new house, is so I can point out everything that's wrong with it, so they don't move. I'm gonna make them stay here.",16
S10E14 Princess Consuela.txt,Mike,You're a strange kind of grown-up.,16
S10E14 Princess Consuela.txt,Phoebe,"Joey, you can't make someone do something they don't want to do. Believe me, there's something I've been trying to get Mike to do in bed and there's... he's just...",16

S10E14 Princess Consuela.txt,Chandler,That is a bad interview.,36
S10E14 Princess Consuela.txt,Phoebe,"What are you, what are you talking about? How did this happen?",36
S10E14 Princess Consuela.txt,Rachel,"Well, my boss was at the same restaurant where I was having my interview and he heard everything. So later he calls me to his office and he tells me that he's gonna have to let me go, because I'm not a team player. And I said ""Wait a minute! Yes I am."" and I had to sit there for 45 minutes while he proved that that in fact... was true.",36

S10E14 Princess Consuela.txt,Joey,Okay. Then I guess I have dry eyes and a scratchy throat for no reason.,48
S10E14 Princess Consuela.txt,Monica,Maybe because it's you hung your head out of the window like a dog the whole ride here.,48
S10E14 Princess Consuela.txt,Monica,No it's not!,49
S10E14 Princess Consuela.txt,Chandler,"When your head was hanging out the window, it didn't hit a mailbox, did it?",50

S07E10 The Huliday Armadillo.txt,Phoebe,And maybe I could teach Ben about the Christmas skull and how people die.,11
S07E10 The Huliday Armadillo.txt,Rachel,You may need to use this year to teach Ben about Phoebe.,11
S07E10 The Huliday Armadillo.txt,Ross,Hmm.,11

S07E10 The Huliday Armadillo.txt,Monica,"I'm sorry. But not that sorry, 'cause you don't have to live with it. Um, we have a reservation under the name Chandler Bing.",23
S07E10 The Huliday Armadillo.txt,Chandler,Forty-five minutes? We have tickets to the Musicman at 8:00.,23
S07E10 The Huliday Armadillo.txt,Chandler,Is this because of the burrito thing?,23
S07E10 The Huliday Armadillo.txt,Chandler,Give him money? It was a joke!,24

S07E10 The Huliday Armadillo.txt,Ben,When is Santa coming?,34
S07E10 The Huliday Armadillo.txt,Ross,"Well, how about this year, instead of Santa, we have fun celebrating Hanukkah?",34

S07E10 The Huliday Armadillo.txt,Monica,We'd be eating our soup right now.,37
S07E10 The Huliday Armadillo.txt,Chandler,Mustached bastard…,37
S07E10 The Huliday Armadillo.txt,Phoebe,"So you like the drums! That's, that's great! Y’know, I was worried, that, you know, they would maybe an unbearable living situation. All right, okay, well, apparently not! So, yay!",44

S07E10 The Huliday Armadillo.txt,Chandler,"If you wanna give Joey a Christmas present that disrupts the entire building, why not get him something a little bit more subtle, like a wrecking ball, or a vile of small pox to release in the hallway?",52
S07E10 The Huliday Armadillo.txt,Monica,"It's not just the drum noise. Every five minutes, Joey throws his sticks in the air, and I have to hear, ""Oh my eye! Oh god, my eye!"" I mean, it is so annoying.",52
S07E10 The Huliday Armadillo.txt,Phoebe,"Yes, thank you. You see, this is how normal people are supposed to react to drums.",52
S07E10 The Huliday Armadillo.txt,Monica,"Phoebe, you got Joey drums to annoy Rachel, so she wouldn't wanna live there anymore?",52
S07E10 The Huliday Armadillo.txt,Phoebe,Maybe on some level.,52
S07E10 The Huliday Armadillo.txt,Rachel,"Joey, y’know that you could just not throw the sticks up in the air.",53
S07E10 The Huliday Armadillo.txt,Joey,What is Rock 'n' Roll about that?,53

S07E10 The Huliday Armadillo.txt,Rachel,And that makes you angry because…,59
S07E10 The Huliday Armadillo.txt,Phoebe,Because you would rather live here with Joey.,59
S07E10 The Huliday Armadillo.txt,Rachel,Where did you get that?,59
S07E10 The Huliday Armadillo.txt,Phoebe,Monica and Chandler said that you were having so much fun here. And apparently no amount of drums or tarantulas is gonna change that.,59
S07E10 The Huliday Armadillo.txt,Rachel,Phoebe?,59
S07E10 The Huliday Armadillo.txt,Phoebe,Hm?,59
S07E10 The Huliday Armadillo.txt,Rachel,"Did you get all this stuff for Joey to try and drive me out of the apartment? Honey, if you wanted to do that, you might as well just gotten him a fish, you know how fish freaked me out!",59

S04E03 The Cuffs.txt,Monica,"Okay ah, please don’t freak out. Umm, but ah, there’s a blue fingernail in one of the quiche cups, and there’s no way to know which one.",39
S04E03 The Cuffs.txt,Phoebe,And! Whoever finds it wins the prize!,39

S04E03 The Cuffs.txt,Chandler,What?!,58
S04E03 The Cuffs.txt,Chandler,"Okay, here’s the situation. The keys to the cuffs are on the back of the door. Could you be a doll and grab them and scoot on over and unlock me? And on a totally different subject, that is a lovely pantsuit.",64
S04E03 The Cuffs.txt,Rachel,You promised you would break up with her!,64
S04E03 The Cuffs.txt,Chandler,"I did break up with her! She just took it really, really well!",64

S04E03 The Cuffs.txt,Rachel,Wait a minute! What are you gonna tell Joanna?,68
S04E03 The Cuffs.txt,Chandler,About what?,68

S04E03 The Cuffs.txt,Monica,"Oh good, I’m glad that’s catching on.",75
S04E03 The Cuffs.txt,Phoebe,"No but, why does that have to be a bad thing. Just change what it means. Y'know? Go down there and prove your Mother wrong. Finish the job you were hired to do, and we’ll call that pulling a Monica.",75
S04E03 The Cuffs.txt,Monica,What?,75
S04E03 The Cuffs.txt,Phoebe,"Okay, umm, if a kid gets straight A’s, his parents would say, ""Yeah, he pulled a Monica."" Y'know? Or a fireman saves a baby, and they go, ""Yeah I know, he pulled a Monica."" Or someone hits a homerun and the announcer says, ""Yeah, that one’s outta here."" Though some things don’t change.",75
S04E03 The Cuffs.txt,Rachel,"Chandler! Chandler, please, I have to get you locked up back the way you were, I am sooo gonna lose my job, she’s very private about her office. Now I know why.",79

S04E03 The Cuffs.txt,Joey,"Twelve hundred dollars? You think I have $1200? I’m home in the middle of the day, and I got patio furniture in my living room. I guess there’s a few things you don’t get from book learnin’.",86
S04E03 The Cuffs.txt,Joey,"How about zero down and zero a month for a long, long time?",86
S04E03 The Cuffs.txt,Joey,"Oh, I-I think I’m gonna stick with the V, I wanna see how this bad boy turns out.",89

S04E03 The Cuffs.txt,Phoebe,"Oh, they love your casserole.",96
S04E03 The Cuffs.txt,Monica,Yes!!,96
S04E03 The Cuffs.txt,Phoebe,It’s hard to believe that just a little while ago this was nothing but ingredients.,96
S04E03 The Cuffs.txt,Monica,And you?,97
S04E03 The Cuffs.txt,Monica,"So if everyone liked it, and you liked it, that would make this a success. Which would make you…",97
S04E03 The Cuffs.txt,Monica,"Well, I was going for wrong, but we can use your word.",98
S04E03 The Cuffs.txt,Monica,Wow!,98
S04E03 The Cuffs.txt,Monica,"That really means a lot. Oh, and Mom, don’t bite your nails.",100

S04E03 The Cuffs.txt,Joey,"Oh yeah, lava spewing, hot ash, of course some are dormant.",105
S04E03 The Cuffs.txt,Monica,Why are you talking about volcanoes all of the sudden?,105
S04E03 The Cuffs.txt,Joey,"Well, we can talk about something else. What do you want to talk about? Vivisection? The Vasdeferens? The Vietnam War?",105
S04E03 The Cuffs.txt,All,"Oh, yeah. Yeah.",106
S04E03 The Cuffs.txt,Phoebe,"Oh God, Korea is such a beautiful country.",106

S05E15 The Girl Who Hits Joey.txt,Phoebe,Yeah. I really like his glasses.,35
S05E15 The Girl Who Hits Joey.txt,Ross,"…so then President Steve told everyone that I was a cheapskate, and now the whole building hates me! A little kid spit on my knee! Y'know what I'm gonna do? I'm gonna throw a party. That's right. For everyone in the building, and I'm gonna sit them down and explain to them, I am not a bad guy. I am not a cheap guy! I'm just a guy who-who stands up for what he believes in. A man with principles.",36
S05E15 The Girl Who Hits Joey.txt,Rachel,"Hmm. Look, Ross, if you want your neighbors to like you, why don't you just pay the hundred bucks? The party's gonna cost you way more than that.",37
S05E15 The Girl Who Hits Joey.txt,Ross,It doesn't matter! It's my principles! We're talking about my principles!,37
S05E15 The Girl Who Hits Joey.txt,Rachel,"Okay, I thought it was about your neighbors liking you.",37
S05E15 The Girl Who Hits Joey.txt,Rachel,And that crazy party animal will be your brother-in-law.,38
S05E15 The Girl Who Hits Joey.txt,Chandler,"Very, very funny, but don't say things like that in front of Monica. I don't want you putting any ideas in her head.",38
S05E15 The Girl Who Hits Joey.txt,Rachel,"Umm, Chandler, you do realize that those ideas are probably already in Monica's head.",38
S05E15 The Girl Who Hits Joey.txt,Chandler,Wh-wh-why?!,38
S05E15 The Girl Who Hits Joey.txt,Rachel,"Well, because she loves you and because you love her.",38
S05E15 The Girl Who Hits Joey.txt,Chandler,"Yeah, so, what's that supposed to mean?!",38
S05E15 The Girl Who Hits Joey.txt,Rachel,"Hey, Chandler, don't freak out! I'm telling you something you already know! Come on, she broke up with Richard because he didn't want to have babies. And she's a woman, and she's almost 30, and y'know it's Monica.",38
S05E15 The Girl Who Hits Joey.txt,Chandler,"I don't see it that way. Okay? Because, I see two Monicas, the one that was my friend, who lived across the hall, and wanted to have a lot of babies and then the new Monica, who I just started to date. Now, who's to say what she wants?! I’m right. I'm right. Am I right?",38
S05E15 The Girl Who Hits Joey.txt,Rachel,"No, you're right, you are absolutely right. I mean that makes, that makes everything different.",38
S05E15 The Girl Who Hits Joey.txt,Chandler,"Okay. It's not different at all, is it?",38
S05E15 The Girl Who Hits Joey.txt,Rachel,Not unless different means the same.,38
S05E15 The Girl Who Hits Joey.txt,Joey,"Uhh, look Katie, uh listen, we-we need to talk. Okay? Umm, look I like you. I-I really do, I like you a lot. Okay? But sometimes when you, when you playfully punch me like that it-it feels like someone's hitting me with a very tiny but very real bat.",42
S05E15 The Girl Who Hits Joey.txt,Monica,Isn't this great?,44
S05E15 The Girl Who Hits Joey.txt,Chandler,Hmm.,44
S05E15 The Girl Who Hits Joey.txt,Monica,Are you okay?,46
S05E15 The Girl Who Hits Joey.txt,Chandler,"Yeah, I'm cool. Casual.",46
S05E15 The Girl Who Hits Joey.txt,Monica,What-what are you doing?,46

S05E15 The Girl Who Hits Joey.txt,Monica,"Man, I knew it! I knew you were going to do this!!",46
S05E15 The Girl Who Hits Joey.txt,Chandler,What?!,46
S05E15 The Girl Who Hits Joey.txt,Monica,Get all freaked out because everybody was talking and just joking around about marriage and stuff.,46
S05E15 The Girl Who Hits Joey.txt,Chandler,"Well, you do want all that stuff, right?",46
S05E15 The Girl Who Hits Joey.txt,Monica,Oh and you know what I want!,46
S05E15 The Girl Who Hits Joey.txt,Chandler,Yes! You want babies! You have baby fever!,46
S05E15 The Girl Who Hits Joey.txt,Monica,I do not have baby fever!,46
S05E15 The Girl Who Hits Joey.txt,Chandler,"Oh please, you are obsessed with babies and-and marriage and everything that's related to babies and-and marriage! I've got an idea, why don't we turn down the heat on this pressure cooker?!",46
S05E15 The Girl Who Hits Joey.txt,Monica,"Have you lost your mind? Chandler, this isn't about me! This is about you and all your weird relationship commitment crap!",46
S05E15 The Girl Who Hits Joey.txt,Chandler,Nah-uh! I know you! Okay? I know the thoughts that you have in the head--in your head!,46
S05E15 The Girl Who Hits Joey.txt,Chandler,"Well, I did not know that.",47
S05E15 The Girl Who Hits Joey.txt,Chandler,"It's gonna be okay, right? I mean she's not gonna leave me? This is, this is fixable.",48
S05E15 The Girl Who Hits Joey.txt,Chandler,By me?,48
S05E15 The Girl Who Hits Joey.txt,Ross,"Oh, no!",48
S05E15 The Girl Who Hits Joey.txt,Joey,No-no.,48
S05E15 The Girl Who Hits Joey.txt,Ross,"Well, unless you make some kind of big gesture.",48

S05E15 The Girl Who Hits Joey.txt,Joey,"Uh-oh, shht! The Misses.",49
S05E15 The Girl Who Hits Joey.txt,Monica,I'm still not done not wanting to talk to you.,51
S05E15 The Girl Who Hits Joey.txt,Chandler,Just tell me what I need to do to make things right.,51
S05E15 The Girl Who Hits Joey.txt,Monica,What?!,51
S05E15 The Girl Who Hits Joey.txt,Chandler,"Well, that's what we do. Y'know, I-I mess up and then you tell me how to fix it and then I do and then y'know you think I'm all cute again.",51
S05E15 The Girl Who Hits Joey.txt,Phoebe,"Oh, hi Ross!",56
S05E15 The Girl Who Hits Joey.txt,Ross,What are you doing?,56
S05E15 The Girl Who Hits Joey.txt,Ross,You chipped in?!,57
S05E15 The Girl Who Hits Joey.txt,Phoebe,"Yeah, uh-huh, a 100 dollars.",57
S05E15 The Girl Who Hits Joey.txt,Ross,Phoebe! I can't believe you gave them money! I thought you agreed it was totally unreasonable that they asked me for that money!,57
S05E15 The Girl Who Hits Joey.txt,Phoebe,"Yeah, but they didn't ask me! Y'know? This way I'm just y'know, the exotic, generous stranger. That's always fun to be.",57
S05E15 The Girl Who Hits Joey.txt,Ross,"Yeah, but you're making me look bad!",57
S05E15 The Girl Who Hits Joey.txt,Phoebe,No I'm not. No! If anything I'm making you look better! They'll see you talking to me and that's--I'm a hit!,57
S05E15 The Girl Who Hits Joey.txt,Phoebe,Hey!,58

S05E15 The Girl Who Hits Joey.txt,Joey,"Well look, I’m breaking up with Katie so I had to put on some extra padding. Y'know? I mean, if she hits me when she's happy, can you imagine how hard she's gonna hit me when I tell her I'm taking away the Joey love?",61
S05E15 The Girl Who Hits Joey.txt,Joey,Hey! Hiya!,62
S05E15 The Girl Who Hits Joey.txt,Rachel,"Hey! Hey, cute jacket!",62

S05E15 The Girl Who Hits Joey.txt,Ross,"So uh, what did you tell them about me?",77
S05E15 The Girl Who Hits Joey.txt,Phoebe,"Oh, I was telling them about you and Emily. Y'know, try to get some sympathy.",77
S05E15 The Girl Who Hits Joey.txt,Phoebe,But somehow you came off as the bad guy.,78
S05E15 The Girl Who Hits Joey.txt,Ross,What?!,78
S05E15 The Girl Who Hits Joey.txt,Phoebe,"Yeah, I think I told it wrong. Y'know, we should talk about that because I don't totally understand what happened there.",78
S05E15 The Girl Who Hits Joey.txt,Phoebe,"Oh, okay, see? Things are looking up already!",79
S05E15 The Girl Who Hits Joey.txt,Steve,3-B!,81

S05E15 The Girl Who Hits Joey.txt,Steve,"Go back to 3-B, 3-B!",81
S05E15 The Girl Who Hits Joey.txt,Phoebe,"Obviously I didn't think they were gonna start throwing things. I just thought if I kept insulting everyone, you would jump in and defend everyone and then you could look like the hero.",83
S05E15 The Girl Who Hits Joey.txt,Ross,"Oh wow, yeah! See, I did not get that.",83
S05E15 The Girl Who Hits Joey.txt,Chandler,Where's Monica?! Where is she? I need to talk to her! It's urgent! Is she here?,84
S05E15 The Girl Who Hits Joey.txt,Chandler,"I need to talk to you, it's urgent!",85
S05E15 The Girl Who Hits Joey.txt,Monica,Okay.,85
S05E15 The Girl Who Hits Joey.txt,Monica,Wait what-wh-wh-what are you doing?!,86

S05E15 The Girl Who Hits Joey.txt,Ross,Oh-no. No. No.,88
S05E15 The Girl Who Hits Joey.txt,Joey,What a bad idea!,88
S05E15 The Girl Who Hits Joey.txt,Monica,"Chandler, why are you doing this?",89
S05E15 The Girl Who Hits Joey.txt,Chandler,I don't know. But I know I'm not afraid to do this.,89
S05E15 The Girl Who Hits Joey.txt,Monica,Chandler.,89
S05E15 The Girl Who Hits Joey.txt,Chandler,I'm doing this because I'm sorry?,89
S05E15 The Girl Who Hits Joey.txt,Monica,"Do you umm, you really think the best reason to get married is because you're sorry?",89
S05E15 The Girl Who Hits Joey.txt,Chandler,"Yeah, I'm kinda wishing everyone wasn't here right now.",91
S05E15 The Girl Who Hits Joey.txt,Monica,Honey! Do you know that none of that stuff came from me?! I mean I never said I wanted to have babies and get married right now!,91
S05E15 The Girl Who Hits Joey.txt,Monica,Who? Two divorces and Joey?!,92
S05E15 The Girl Who Hits Joey.txt,Ross,Hey!,92
S05E15 The Girl Who Hits Joey.txt,Joey,She's right y'know.,92
S05E15 The Girl Who Hits Joey.txt,Ross,"Yeah, but still, cheap shot!",92
S05E15 The Girl Who Hits Joey.txt,Monica,"Y'know what? Y'know when I said that I want you to deal with this relationship stuff all on your own? Well, you're not ready for that.",92
S05E15 The Girl Who Hits Joey.txt,Chandler,I didn't think I was!,92
S05E15 The Girl Who Hits Joey.txt,Monica,"Oh my God, what would have done if I said yes?",93
S05E15 The Girl Who Hits Joey.txt,Joey,"Hey Ross, will you pass me that knife?",95
S05E15 The Girl Who Hits Joey.txt,Ross,"No, I will not!",95
S05E15 The Girl Who Hits Joey.txt,Joey,"Oh, it's okay. You don't have to be so mean about it.",95
S05E15 The Girl Who Hits Joey.txt,Ross,"You're right, I'm sorry. Will you marry me?",95
S05E15 The Girl Who Hits Joey.txt,Phoebe,"Aw, and I was gonna ask you to marry me because I forgot to say hello to you last week.",96
S05E15 The Girl Who Hits Joey.txt,Rachel,"Oh no wait Pheebs, I think for something like that you just ask them to move in with you. But I'm not sure, Chandler?",96
S05E15 The Girl Who Hits Joey.txt,Chandler,"Okay, how long is this going to go on.",96
S05E15 The Girl Who Hits Joey.txt,Monica,"Well I think the length of teasing is directly related to how insane you were so, a long time.",96
S05E15 The Girl Who Hits Joey.txt,Chandler,That's not funny.,97
S05E15 The Girl Who Hits Joey.txt,Joey,That's not funny at all!,97
S10E07 The Home Study.txt,Ross,Hey you guys!,3

S10E07 The Home Study.txt,Chandler,"That's funny, we were doing the same thing!",3
S10E07 The Home Study.txt,Ross,Yeah!,3
S10E07 The Home Study.txt,Phoebe,"It's really crazy! The hall, the dress, the food... I-I had no idea how expensive this stuff was!",3
S10E07 The Home Study.txt,Chandler,"Yeah it is really pricey. I mean, I freaked when I first heard the numbers.",3
S10E07 The Home Study.txt,Phoebe,So what did you two do about it?,3
S10E07 The Home Study.txt,Chandler,"It was pretty simple actually, I came up with a couple of cost-cutting solutions, wrote out a list and Monica told me to go to hell.",3
S10E07 The Home Study.txt,Ross,"There's no way around it Pheebs, you just gonna have to accept the fact that this is gonna cost you a lot of money.",3
S10E07 The Home Study.txt,Mike,I heard that weddings are like a 40 billion dollar a year industry.,3
S10E07 The Home Study.txt,Ross,"Yeah, and I'm responsible for just like half of that.",3
S10E07 The Home Study.txt,Phoebe,"But really, it does seem like this money could be put to better use?",3
S10E07 The Home Study.txt,Mike,Are you serious?,3
S10E07 The Home Study.txt,Phoebe,"Yeah! Now, how would you feel if we gave all the wedding money to charity and we just got married at City Hall?",3
S10E07 The Home Study.txt,Ross,"I've got to say you guys, that's an incredible gesture!",4
S10E07 The Home Study.txt,Joey,Hey!,8
S10E07 The Home Study.txt,Chandler,Hey!,8
S10E07 The Home Study.txt,Joey,What's going on?,8
S10E07 The Home Study.txt,Chandler,Our adoption social worker is coming by today so we are cleaning the apartment.,8
S10E07 The Home Study.txt,Chandler,You know you don't want me to help. You can't have it both ways!,9
S10E07 The Home Study.txt,Joey,"Hey, is this person who decides whether or not you... get a baby?",9
S10E07 The Home Study.txt,Chandler,Kind of. She's coming by to interview us and see where we live.,9
S10E07 The Home Study.txt,Monica,"And it has to go perfectly, because if she doesn't like something about us she can keep us off every adoption list in the state.",9
S10E07 The Home Study.txt,Joey,"Hey, maybe I should stop by! She could be a soap opera fan! It's very impressive when the little people know a celebrity.",9
S10E07 The Home Study.txt,Monica,"Ok, so I think I'm just about done here, unless you have any bad stuff hidden somewhere, like... porn or cigarettes?",11
S10E07 The Home Study.txt,Chandler,What...? NO!,11
S10E07 The Home Study.txt,Monica,Chandler?,11
S10E07 The Home Study.txt,Monica,"Ok, so there's not a magazine under the couch, or a pack of cigarettes taped to the back of the toilet tank, or a filthy video in the VCR?",12
S10E07 The Home Study.txt,Chandler,"I'll admit to the cigarettes and the magazine, but that tape is not mine.",12
S10E07 The Home Study.txt,Monica,It isn't mine!,12
S10E07 The Home Study.txt,Phoebe,Yes. We're here to make a rather sizeable donation to the children.,14
S10E07 The Home Study.txt,Phoebe,And we don't want any recognition. This is completely anonymous.,15
S10E07 The Home Study.txt,Mike,Completely anonymous. From two kind strangers.,15
S10E07 The Home Study.txt,Phoebe,Mr. X and Phoebe Buffay.,15
S10E07 The Home Study.txt,Mike,Not necessary.,15
S10E07 The Home Study.txt,Phoebe,Buffay is spelled B-U-F-F-A-Y.,15
S10E07 The Home Study.txt,Mike,"And ""X"" is spelled uhm... ""Mike Hannigan"".",15
S10E07 The Home Study.txt,Phoebe,"Sure, I so glad we did this. It feels so good!",15
S10E07 The Home Study.txt,Mike,It does. It feels really good!,15
S10E07 The Home Study.txt,Phoebe,Mhm... it's moist.,16
S10E07 The Home Study.txt,Rachel,Hi! Emma will be up in a minute!,18
S10E07 The Home Study.txt,Ross,"Oh, good!",18
S10E07 The Home Study.txt,Rachel,"Oh hey Ross... Listen, I heard about you and Charlie. I'm really sorry.",18
S10E07 The Home Study.txt,Ross,"Oh, that's OK. I'm sure there are tons of other beautiful paleontologists out there.",18
S10E07 The Home Study.txt,Rachel,Absolutely.,18
S10E07 The Home Study.txt,Ross,There was one! She's it! All the rest look like they should live under a bridge!,18
S10E07 The Home Study.txt,Rachel,"So, uhm... what are you gonna do today?",18
S10E07 The Home Study.txt,Ross,"Well, I was thinking of taking Emma to the playground!",18
S10E07 The Home Study.txt,Rachel,"Oh my God, what!?",18
S10E07 The Home Study.txt,Ross,Like I said I was thinking of taking Emma to the museum of knives and fire!,18
S10E07 The Home Study.txt,Rachel,"Ok, look, Ross. I do not want Emma going to the playground.",18
S10E07 The Home Study.txt,Ross,Be-caaauuuse...,18
S10E07 The Home Study.txt,Ross,Seriously?,19
S10E07 The Home Study.txt,Rachel,"Ok, fine! You can make fun of me. I do not want Emma going there. And I was thinking Claire Danes.",21
S10E07 The Home Study.txt,Ross,"Look, I'm sorry to hear about your tragedy, ok? But the swings are perfectly safe, and besides Emma loves them. You know what, you should come with us and you'll see!",21
S10E07 The Home Study.txt,Rachel,"Ross, those things go like 40 miles an hour! Ok? When you're... and there is that moment when you are at the top, when you just don't know if you're gonna return back to earth!",21
S10E07 The Home Study.txt,Rachel,All right!,22
S10E07 The Home Study.txt,Ross,"Good, you don’t want to be one of those mothers who pass on their irrational fears on their children, do you?",22
S10E07 The Home Study.txt,Rachel,"Irrational, huh? All right, well, I’ll remember that the next time you freak out about a spider in your apartment!",22
S10E07 The Home Study.txt,Ross,"Oh, yeah, that’s the same, I am sure there are thirty different species of poisonous swings!",22
S10E07 The Home Study.txt,Monica,"Oh my God, the adoption lady is early!",23

S10E07 The Home Study.txt,Monica,Ok.,23
S10E07 The Home Study.txt,Phoebe,"Hello, is this the creepy residence?",24
S10E07 The Home Study.txt,Phoebe,"Awe, this is so sweet of you! But you know what? I won’t be needing a veil, I actually won’t be wearing a dress at all!",25
S10E07 The Home Study.txt,Monica,I told you! I am not coming to a naked wedding!,25
S10E07 The Home Study.txt,Phoebe,"No, no, no, we’re not having a big reception, we took the money we were gonna spend on a wedding and we donate them to the children charity.",25
S10E07 The Home Study.txt,Monica,"That’s right. You’re making a commitment and that’s the same, whether you do that at the Plaza or, where are you gonna do it?",27
S10E07 The Home Study.txt,Phoebe,City Hall.,27
S10E07 The Home Study.txt,Monica,Yay!,29
S10E07 The Home Study.txt,Chandler,But you already gave all your money to charity!,29
S10E07 The Home Study.txt,Phoebe,"Well, I’ll just ask for it back!",29
S10E07 The Home Study.txt,Chandler,I don’t think you can do that!,29
S10E07 The Home Study.txt,Monica,"Why not! This is her wedding day, this is way more important than some stupid kids!",29
S10E07 The Home Study.txt,Chandler,"That’s sweet, honey, but save something for the adoption Lady.",29
S10E07 The Home Study.txt,Rachel,"Ok, careful.",30
S10E07 The Home Study.txt,Ross,Ok.,30

S10E07 The Home Study.txt,Ross,"Oh, absolutely!",35
S10E07 The Home Study.txt,Mike,We’re seriously asking for our money back?,38
S10E07 The Home Study.txt,Phoebe,"It’s for our wedding day! Right, now, is this guy gay or straight, because one of us gonna have to start flirting.",38
S10E07 The Home Study.txt,Phoebe,"The donation we made earlier, we k…, we w…, we want it back.",40
S10E07 The Home Study.txt,Phoebe,"Yeah. See, that money was for a big wedding, that we thought we didn’t want, but it turns out we do.",40
S10E07 The Home Study.txt,Mike,Yeah! This feels really good.,40
S10E07 The Home Study.txt,Phoebe,"I am sorry. I am, but this wedding is just really important to me.",40
S10E07 The Home Study.txt,Mike,She could have been talking about either one of us.,42

S10E07 The Home Study.txt,Laura,Your place is just lovely.,43
S10E07 The Home Study.txt,Monica,"Ah, thank you. This building does have a wholesome family feel to it.",43

S10E07 The Home Study.txt,Laura,Oh...,44
S10E07 The Home Study.txt,Chandler,What?,44
S10E07 The Home Study.txt,Laura,I just realized why I remember this place.,44
S10E07 The Home Study.txt,Monica,Really? What is it?,44

S02E17 Eddie Moves In.txt,Phoebe,"Well I have a video, you have to pay attention. No this, this voice woman, she's so talented but, according to the producer people, they said she doesn't have like the right look or something, ya know. I mean, it's like, she's like one of those an imals at the pound who like nobody wants 'cause they're not pretty enough or you know. Like, like some old dog who's just kind of like stinky and. Huuuuh, oh my God, she's smelly cat. Oh, oh that song has so many levels.",59

S08E07 The Stain.txt,Chandler,"Y’know uh, I didn’t actually do this.",4
S08E07 The Stain.txt,Monica,"Oh no, was I cleaning in my sleep again?",4
S08E07 The Stain.txt,Chandler,"No, it wasn’t you.",4
S08E07 The Stain.txt,Monica,Well then who?,4
S08E07 The Stain.txt,Chandler,I got a maid. Yay!,4
S08E07 The Stain.txt,Chandler,"Uh honey, I know you don’t like to relinquish control…",5
S08E07 The Stain.txt,Monica,"Oh, relinquish is just a fancy word for lose!",5
S08E07 The Stain.txt,Chandler,"Look, she’s really nice. Okay? And she mentioned that she adored the way that you arranged the sponges.",5
S08E07 The Stain.txt,Monica,Did she really say that?,5
S08E07 The Stain.txt,Chandler,"Yes, I distinctly remember ‘cause I thought it was a joke. Now just give her a chance, okay?",5
S08E07 The Stain.txt,Chandler,What’s the matter?,6
S08E07 The Stain.txt,Monica,"Well, usually when I’m this anxious, I clean!",6
S08E07 The Stain.txt,Ross,I think it’s coming from your bag.,8

S08E07 The Stain.txt,Phoebe,Wow! What an incredible violation—and wonderful surprise.,9
S08E07 The Stain.txt,Eric,"Uh listen, I just—I thought you should know I broke up with Ursula.",9
S08E07 The Stain.txt,Rachel,Wow! What did he do?,10
S08E07 The Stain.txt,Phoebe,Shhh! I’m talking.,10
S08E07 The Stain.txt,Eric,"Anyway, I was wondering if, you were the sort of person who…eats lunch.",10
S08E07 The Stain.txt,Phoebe,Are you asking me out? ‘Cause it would be kinda weird since you just broke up with my sister.,10
S08E07 The Stain.txt,Eric,Yeah uh…okay. I’m-I’m sorry. Bye.,10
S08E07 The Stain.txt,Phoebe,No! Wait! I was just saying that so you’d think I was a good person. Fight for me.,10
S08E07 The Stain.txt,Eric,"Uhh, I won’t take no for an answer.",10
S08E07 The Stain.txt,Phoebe,"Not great, but we can work on it at lunch. Okay, I can be at your apartment in two hours.",10
S08E07 The Stain.txt,Eric,Great! But wh-wh—How do you know where I live?,10
S08E07 The Stain.txt,Phoebe,"I’ve got friends too. Okay, bye.",10

S08E07 The Stain.txt,Ross,So apparently I’m available for lunch.,12
S08E07 The Stain.txt,Rachel,I can’t. I’m busy. I’m apartment hunting.,12
S08E07 The Stain.txt,Ross,You’re moving?,12
S08E07 The Stain.txt,Ross,So does-does Joey know you’re moving?,13
S08E07 The Stain.txt,Rachel,"Well, I haven’t discussed it with him yet, but I know he’s gonna be relieved. Last week, he brought this girl over and I started talking to her about morning sickness and then I showed her pictures from my pregnancy book.",13
S08E07 The Stain.txt,Ross,That’s not really porn.,13
S08E07 The Stain.txt,Rachel,Not so much.,13
S08E07 The Stain.txt,Ross,"Hey, y’know what and if you’re looking for a place? I just heard in the elevator this morning that a woman in my building died.",13
S08E07 The Stain.txt,Rachel,Oh my God! Was she old? Does she have a view?,13
S08E07 The Stain.txt,Rachel,Yeah that would really be great.,14
S08E07 The Stain.txt,Ross,Yeah.,14
S08E07 The Stain.txt,Rachel,Well can we see it?! Oh maybe we shouldn’t. I mean if she just died this morning out of respect.,14
S08E07 The Stain.txt,Ross,Yeah. No. No you’re right.,14
S08E07 The Stain.txt,Rachel,Shall we?,15
S08E07 The Stain.txt,Ross,Yeah.,15
S08E07 The Stain.txt,Ross,Hi. I’m Ross Geller. I live in the building.,17
S08E07 The Stain.txt,Rachel,"And I’m Rachel, an admirer of the building.",17
S08E07 The Stain.txt,Ross,I-I heard about Mrs. Verhoeven passing away and I’m so sorry for your loss.,17
S08E07 The Stain.txt,Ross,What?,17
S08E07 The Stain.txt,Ross,"Oh, thank God!",17
S08E07 The Stain.txt,Rachel,Ahh.,17
S08E07 The Stain.txt,Ross,Y’know I would it’s just painful.,19
S08E07 The Stain.txt,Rachel,So she’s really not dead.,19
S08E07 The Stain.txt,Rachel,"Hmm. Do you think—Could you tell me if she’s hanging in, in a one bedroom or a two?",19
S08E07 The Stain.txt,Brenda,"Mrs. Bing, this tile cleaner is incredible! Where’d you get it?",20
S08E07 The Stain.txt,Monica,"Oh well umm, I make it myself! It’s two parts ammonia and one part lemon juice. And now the secret ingredient is…y’know what? We just met.",20
S08E07 The Stain.txt,Brenda,"Okay. Uhh, I’m gonna go get the clothes from the laundry room now. And, when I come back I’ll clean behind the refrigerator.",20
S08E07 The Stain.txt,Brenda,I’ll be back in a minute.,21
S08E07 The Stain.txt,Chandler,See? I told you.,22
S08E07 The Stain.txt,Monica,She stole my jeans!,22
S08E07 The Stain.txt,Monica,I have been looking for them all week and she is wearing them!,23
S08E07 The Stain.txt,Chandler,So she stole your pants and then she came back and wore them in front of you?,23
S08E07 The Stain.txt,Monica,Don’t you see? It’s the perfect crime!,23
S08E07 The Stain.txt,Chandler,She must’ve been planning this for years!,23
S08E07 The Stain.txt,Monica,I will prove it to you! Okay? About a week ago I was wearing those jeans and I dropped a pen in my lap and it left an ink stain on the crotch. Now when she comes back I will find it and show you that stain!,23
S08E07 The Stain.txt,Chandler,"Honey, isn’t it possible that the company that sold the jeans made more than just the one pair?",23
S08E07 The Stain.txt,Monica,I guess.,23
S08E07 The Stain.txt,Chandler,"So, shouldn’t we go give her the benefit of the doubt before we go…snooping around her crotch?",23
S08E07 The Stain.txt,Monica,Fine. I’m just glad I didn’t give her my secret ingredient.,23
S08E07 The Stain.txt,Chandler,"Out of curiosity, what is your secret ingredient?",23
S08E07 The Stain.txt,Phoebe,Hi!,25
S08E07 The Stain.txt,Eric,"Come in, I’m so glad you’re here.",25
S08E07 The Stain.txt,Phoebe,"Yeah, me too. Not in the shaky angry way you are though.",25
S08E07 The Stain.txt,Eric,"Sorry, I just saw Ursula. I had to give the engagement ring back.",25
S08E07 The Stain.txt,Phoebe,Oh.,25
S08E07 The Stain.txt,Eric,I’m sorry. I just…when I look at you I see her. When I see her I get a little bit angry.,27
S08E07 The Stain.txt,Phoebe,Maybe this is too weird.,27
S08E07 The Stain.txt,Phoebe,No don’t tear out your eyes!!,28
S08E07 The Stain.txt,Eric,"I was just, I was just gonna take out my lenses.",28
S08E07 The Stain.txt,Ross,"Yeah, we’re done.",34
S08E07 The Stain.txt,Ross,Really?!,37

S08E07 The Stain.txt,Joey,"All right, well finish your coffee; let’s go.",38
S08E07 The Stain.txt,Ross,Okay I-I just have to stop by my place first.,38
S08E07 The Stain.txt,Joey,"To tape the game? You do this every time Ross, you’re not gonna be on TV!",38
S08E07 The Stain.txt,Ross,"No-no, I-I have to see if this apartment became available.",38
S08E07 The Stain.txt,Joey,"Oh, you’re switching apartments?",38
S08E07 The Stain.txt,Ross,"It’s not for me, it’s for Rachel.",38
S08E07 The Stain.txt,Joey,But Rachel has an apartment.,38
S08E07 The Stain.txt,Ross,"Yeah, but when the baby comes she’s gonna want to move.",38
S08E07 The Stain.txt,Joey,She is?,38
S08E07 The Stain.txt,Ross,"Yeah, you didn’t expect her to live there with a baby did you?",38
S08E07 The Stain.txt,Joey,I guess I didn’t really think about it.,38
S08E07 The Stain.txt,Ross,Damnit!,40
S08E07 The Stain.txt,Monica,Nice jeans!,41
S08E07 The Stain.txt,Brenda,Oh thanks! I like your top.,41

S08E07 The Stain.txt,Brenda,I was thinking about taking my lunch break.,43
S08E07 The Stain.txt,Monica,"Oh, will you do the top of the cabinets? That’ll really work up your appetite for lunch.",43
S08E07 The Stain.txt,Brenda,All right.,43
S08E07 The Stain.txt,Monica,Hello.,44
S08E07 The Stain.txt,Brenda,What’s going on?!,44
S08E07 The Stain.txt,Monica,"I’m sorry. I’ve never had a maid before, is this not okay?",44
S08E07 The Stain.txt,Rachel,Hey!,45
S08E07 The Stain.txt,Joey,Hey!,45

S08E07 The Stain.txt,Rachel,Oh.,45
S08E07 The Stain.txt,Rachel,Oh yeah! Hopefully across the street if certain Dutch people would just let go.,46
S08E07 The Stain.txt,Joey,I was kinda hoping you’d stay.,46
S08E07 The Stain.txt,Rachel,"Oh but Joey, I have to go. There’s no room for a baby here.",46
S08E07 The Stain.txt,Rachel,"Honey, it’s not just a matter of where you put it. I mean a baby changes everything. They cry all the time. I mean imagine bringing home some girl and trying to score when there’s a screaming baby around.",47
S08E07 The Stain.txt,Joey,I could use a challenge! It’s getting pretty easy.,47
S08E07 The Stain.txt,Rachel,"Honey, it’s so sweet that you want me to stay, but I-I can’t do that to you. I mean it would disrupt your entire life.",47
S08E07 The Stain.txt,Joey,I love living with you so much. I just wish things didn’t have to change.,47
S08E07 The Stain.txt,Rachel,I know.,47
S08E07 The Stain.txt,Joey,Y’know I blame Ross for this.,47
S08E07 The Stain.txt,Rachel,I do too a little bit.,47
S08E07 The Stain.txt,Joey,"I’m gonna miss you, you’re the hottest roommate I ever had.",47
S08E07 The Stain.txt,Phoebe,"Ooh, oh no! I have to go! I have a massage appointment.",48
S08E07 The Stain.txt,Eric,"Oh no, stay here we’ll keep doing this. I’ll pay you.",48
S08E07 The Stain.txt,Phoebe,"No, I got in trouble for that before. I’ll see you later.",48
S08E07 The Stain.txt,Monica,"Hey! Umm, I think Brenda needs a raise.",52
S08E07 The Stain.txt,Chandler,How come?,52
S08E07 The Stain.txt,Monica,Because I put my head between her legs.,52
S08E07 The Stain.txt,Chandler,To see her pants?,52
S08E07 The Stain.txt,Monica,They’re my pants!,52
S08E07 The Stain.txt,Chandler,Are you sure? Did you see the stain?,52
S08E07 The Stain.txt,Monica,No! I was just getting into position and then everything went dark.,52
S08E07 The Stain.txt,Chandler,"God! She is not stealing from us! Okay, will you let this go?",52
S08E07 The Stain.txt,Chandler,Oh dear God!,53
S08E07 The Stain.txt,Monica,My pink flowered bra! I recognize the strap!,53
S08E07 The Stain.txt,Chandler,And yet you don’t recognize that you’re crazy.,53
S08E07 The Stain.txt,Monica,Here’s the plan! Okay? I’m going to leave you get a look at Brenda’s bra!,53
S08E07 The Stain.txt,Chandler,Here’s another plan…No!,53
S08E07 The Stain.txt,Monica,I would do it but she thinks I’m attracted to her!,53
S08E07 The Stain.txt,Chandler,Why?,53
S08E07 The Stain.txt,Monica,Did you not hear where my head was? Come on! Come on we’re a team! We’re in this together!,53
S08E07 The Stain.txt,Chandler,I fear a jury will see it the same way!,53
S08E07 The Stain.txt,Monica,"Do this for me! Come on, I catch you looking at woman’s breasts all the time!",53
S08E07 The Stain.txt,Chandler,You see that?,53
S08E07 The Stain.txt,Chandler,All right. Yes. Okay. I get your point. But if it’s not your bra will you just let the woman clean the apartment?!,54
S08E07 The Stain.txt,Monica,"Yes! Absolutely. Okay? Look, you’ll know it’s mine because on the right cup, the lacey part, there’s a very noticeable rip.",54
S08E07 The Stain.txt,Chandler,You need new clothes.,54
S08E07 The Stain.txt,Ross,Hi. How is she?,55
S08E07 The Stain.txt,Ross,Oh I don’t know that it would.,57
S08E07 The Stain.txt,Eric,Welcome back!,60
S08E07 The Stain.txt,Eric,"I don’t know, I’m still pretty tired out from this afternoon.",61
S08E07 The Stain.txt,Phoebe,Why?,61
S08E07 The Stain.txt,Eric,"Uh, the sex.",61
S08E07 The Stain.txt,Phoebe,What sex?,61
S08E07 The Stain.txt,Eric,Our sex.,61
S08E07 The Stain.txt,Phoebe,We didn’t have sex.,61
S08E07 The Stain.txt,Eric,"Well if I didn’t have sex with you, I had sex with someone that looked an awful lot like…",61
S08E07 The Stain.txt,Phoebe,You-you…you had sex with Ursula?!,63
S08E07 The Stain.txt,Eric,"Uh, a little bit. She-she-she walked in and I thought she was you and I kissed her and…",63
S08E07 The Stain.txt,Phoebe,You didn’t notice she was wearing different clothes?!,63
S08E07 The Stain.txt,Eric,Well I was just so excited to see you.,63
S08E07 The Stain.txt,Phoebe,Oh. Ew! Ew! Ew! Ugh! Y’know what? This is too weird.,63
S08E07 The Stain.txt,Eric,No-no it’s not! I don’t want to lose you! It’s-it’s like I was saying to Ursula when I was making love to her and I thought she was you—Yeah it is too weird.,63
S08E07 The Stain.txt,Phoebe,So I guess this is it.,63
S08E07 The Stain.txt,Phoebe,"Yeah, so do you.",64
S08E07 The Stain.txt,Chandler,I’m leaning. This is where I lean.,66
S08E07 The Stain.txt,Brenda,Okay. (Goes over and fluffs up the pillows on the couch.,66
S08E07 The Stain.txt,Chandler,Brenda a bee!,66
S08E07 The Stain.txt,Brenda,What?,66
S08E07 The Stain.txt,Chandler,Yes! It’s flown into your blouse and you’d better undo your buttons lest it sting you!,66
S08E07 The Stain.txt,Brenda,I think I know what’s going on here.,66
S08E07 The Stain.txt,Chandler,You do?,66
S08E07 The Stain.txt,Brenda,"Look, I know it must be hard that your wife is a lesbian, but it’s wrong. You’re married.",66
S08E07 The Stain.txt,Rachel,Hi!,68
S08E07 The Stain.txt,Rachel,You gave them to me!,69
S08E07 The Stain.txt,Monica,No I didn’t!,69
S08E07 The Stain.txt,Rachel,"All right, I took them. But I figured it would be okay because you got a big ink stain on the crotch.",69
S08E07 The Stain.txt,Monica,Oh no! Did you take my bra too?!,69
S08E07 The Stain.txt,Rachel,What bra?,69
S08E07 The Stain.txt,Monica,The pink one with the flowers?!,69
S08E07 The Stain.txt,Monica,Sounds about right.,71
S08E07 The Stain.txt,Rachel,What is this?,72
S08E07 The Stain.txt,Rachel,"But Joey the baby is going to be crying, it’s going to be loud.",75
S08E07 The Stain.txt,Joey,I’m loud!,75

S08E07 The Stain.txt,Rachel,It’s gonna poop!,75
S08E07 The Stain.txt,Joey,Hello!,75
S08E07 The Stain.txt,Rachel,What about all the women you want to bring home?,75
S08E07 The Stain.txt,Joey,"Look, if I’m bringing home a woman who can’t stand being around a baby, then maybe I don’t want to be with that woman! Or maybe we’ll just do it in the bathroom of the club!",75
S08E07 The Stain.txt,Rachel,"Joey, are you sure?",75
S08E07 The Stain.txt,Joey,"Yeah! All right—Look, I know sometimes it’ll be hard, okay? But, it’ll also be really…really great. Please Rachel! I-I-I really want you to stay.",75
S08E07 The Stain.txt,Rachel,I want me to stay too.,75
S08E07 The Stain.txt,Joey,Ohh!,75
S08E07 The Stain.txt,Joey,I know! I found it on the street.,76
S08E07 The Stain.txt,Rachel,Are you serious—Really?! It’s in such good condition.,76
S08E07 The Stain.txt,Joey,Yeah.,76
S08E07 The Stain.txt,Rachel,Wow! Whoa-whoa what’s under the covers?,76
S08E07 The Stain.txt,Joey,I don’t know.,76
S08E07 The Stain.txt,Rachel,It’s moving.,76
S08E07 The Stain.txt,Joey,Ew.,76
S08E07 The Stain.txt,Rachel,Ewww. Yeah. Umm. I think I’m gonna stay here.,80

S10E05 Rachels Sister Babysits.txt,Joey,"Oh, ‘They are warm, nice, people with big hearts’.",40

S10E05 Rachels Sister Babysits.txt,Monica,"Hey Joey, I don’t think we can use this.",40

S10E05 Rachels Sister Babysits.txt,Joey,'Cause we will appreciate it more when she’s gone?,48
S10E05 Rachels Sister Babysits.txt,Rachel,"No, it's just... look, you know, when I first moved to the city I was a lot like her! I was spoiled, self-centered and you guys really took care of me.",48
S10E05 Rachels Sister Babysits.txt,Joey,"Yeah, Monica made us!",48
S10E05 Rachels Sister Babysits.txt,Rachel,"Well, uhm... whatever, I have really appreciated it, 'cause I don’t think I would be the person that I am today if it wasn’t for you guys. See, I wanna help Amy the way you guys helped me. And I know it’s gonna take patience, but that’s ok.",48
S10E05 Rachels Sister Babysits.txt,Amy,Good morning.,48

S10E05 Rachels Sister Babysits.txt,Amy,"Oh, sweety, you can’t pull this off.",48
S10E05 Rachels Sister Babysits.txt,Rachel,"Amy, you know what? I was thinking that maybe now it'd be a good time for us to sit down and, you know, talk about your future.",48
S10E05 Rachels Sister Babysits.txt,Phoebe,Hi. I just had the worst anniversary ever.,51
S10E05 Rachels Sister Babysits.txt,Chandler,I doubt that! Tell her about us last year.,51

S10E05 Rachels Sister Babysits.txt,Monica,"Oh my God, Mike was gonna propose?",51
S10E05 Rachels Sister Babysits.txt,Rachel,"Phoebe, that’s huge!",51
S10E05 Rachels Sister Babysits.txt,Ross,"Well, do you wanna marry him?",51
S10E05 Rachels Sister Babysits.txt,Phoebe,"Yeah, I really do! Yes, but, after I dumped on the way he was gonna propose to me, I don’t think he’s ever gonna ask again! I mean, I said no in Barbados and now this!",51
S10E05 Rachels Sister Babysits.txt,Monica,"Maybe you don't need him to propose to you, maybe you can propose to him!",52
S10E05 Rachels Sister Babysits.txt,Phoebe,"Oh, I don't know, I don't know, isn't that a little desperate?",52
S10E05 Rachels Sister Babysits.txt,Chandler,"Oh, I don't think it was desperate, I think it was amazing!",53
S10E05 Rachels Sister Babysits.txt,Monica,Thank you.,53
S10E05 Rachels Sister Babysits.txt,Rachel,I think it could be kind of great!,54
S10E05 Rachels Sister Babysits.txt,Ross,Absolutely! You'll love the feeling! There's nothing like it!,54
S10E05 Rachels Sister Babysits.txt,Phoebe,"Ok, ok, so how should I do it?",54

S10E05 Rachels Sister Babysits.txt,Amy,She did? Who got her condo in Boca?,59
S10E05 Rachels Sister Babysits.txt,Ross,"No, I can't. I have back-to-back classes. Did Molly say what she had? Because my throat's been hurting?",60
S10E05 Rachels Sister Babysits.txt,Rachel,Menstrual cramps.,60
S10E05 Rachels Sister Babysits.txt,Ross,I don't think that's what this is.,60

S10E05 Rachels Sister Babysits.txt,Monica,"Oh my God, oh my God, that letter is gonna go in our file! We're never gonna get a kid. No, we're gonna be one of those old couples that collects orchids or has a lot of birds!",76
S10E05 Rachels Sister Babysits.txt,Monica,Okay good.,77
S10E05 Rachels Sister Babysits.txt,Monica,"Ugh, we're screwed, aren't we? You know what? Just tell me on the way to the bird store.",78

S10E05 Rachels Sister Babysits.txt,Amy,Ta-daaa!,85
S10E05 Rachels Sister Babysits.txt,Rachel,You pierced her ears? How could you do this without telling me?,89

S10E05 Rachels Sister Babysits.txt,Ross,Hey guys.,92
S10E05 Rachels Sister Babysits.txt,Rachel,"Nah, I don't really want her to see.",93
S10E05 Rachels Sister Babysits.txt,Ross,Why not?,93
S10E05 Rachels Sister Babysits.txt,Monica,Because there are so many terrible sights in this world.,93
S10E05 Rachels Sister Babysits.txt,Chandler,Like war. Or that thing in Joey's refrigerator. Remember? It was in a milk carton but it looked like meat?,93
S10E05 Rachels Sister Babysits.txt,Rachel,Nothing.,96

S10E05 Rachels Sister Babysits.txt,Amy,"Yeah well, at least now people will know she is a girl!",117
S10E05 Rachels Sister Babysits.txt,Amy,"You know what? Ever since I got here, you have been nothing but negative.",118
S10E05 Rachels Sister Babysits.txt,Rachel,Excuse me?,118
S10E05 Rachels Sister Babysits.txt,Amy,"You know what? When I moved in here I thought: This is gonna be so great. Just us sisters, back together again like when we were kids, except without that stupid Jill... Oh! Who has gotten fat by the way...",121

S10E05 Rachels Sister Babysits.txt,Phoebe,"It's in the cake, isn't it?",128
S10E05 Rachels Sister Babysits.txt,Phoebe,"What's the matter with me? How do I keep ruining this? I'm sorry, I'm sorry!",129
S10E05 Rachels Sister Babysits.txt,Mike,No! It's my fault. I keep trying to propose in these stupid ways and all I wanna do is tell you that I love you and I want to spend the rest of my life with you.,129
S10E05 Rachels Sister Babysits.txt,Mike,I'm gonna do this now.,130

S10E05 Rachels Sister Babysits.txt,Rachel,So how is the uhm... baby styling business going?,137
S10E05 Rachels Sister Babysits.txt,Amy,Not that great. It's almost if people don't want to hear that their babies are ugly.,137
S10E05 Rachels Sister Babysits.txt,Rachel,That's shocking!,137
S05E19 Ross Cant Flirt.txt,Ross,Hey!,2

S05E19 Ross Cant Flirt.txt,Monica,"Chandler, this actually bothers you?",37

S05E19 Ross Cant Flirt.txt,Chandler,"Okay, I've already taught you so much already, but whatever. See when you flirt with a guy you think, ""I'm just flirting, no big deal."" But the guy is thinking, ""Finally! Somebody who wants to sleep with me!""",69
S05E19 Ross Cant Flirt.txt,Monica,No way!,69
S05E19 Ross Cant Flirt.txt,Chandler,It's true.,69

S01E20 The Evil Orthodontist.txt,Chandler,"Yes, it's working! Why isn't she calling me back?",27
S01E20 The Evil Orthodontist.txt,Joey,Maybe she never got your message.,27
S01E20 The Evil Orthodontist.txt,Phoebe,"Y'know, if you want, you can call her machine, and if she has a lot of beeps, that means she probably didn't get her messages yet.",27
S01E20 The Evil Orthodontist.txt,Chandler,Y'don't think that makes me seem a little...,27

S08E03 Rachel Tells....txt,Chandler,You already know.,21
S08E03 Rachel Tells....txt,Phoebe,"Oh, it's so romantic to send people off on their honeymoon.",22

S08E03 Rachel Tells....txt,Joey,"I don’t have a key, they took mine to give to you.",22
S08E03 Rachel Tells....txt,Phoebe,What?! They took mine to give to you!,22
S08E03 Rachel Tells....txt,Joey,Why would they take away our keys?,22
S08E03 Rachel Tells....txt,Phoebe,Maybe they don’t trust us.,22
S08E03 Rachel Tells....txt,Joey,No that’s not it. They let me keep my key the last time they were out of town.,22
S08E03 Rachel Tells....txt,Phoebe,You mean the time you broke the ketchup bottle and cleaned it up with Monica’s guest towels?,22
S08E03 Rachel Tells....txt,Joey,"Hey, I washed those!",22

S08E03 Rachel Tells....txt,Ross,I think I might know what this is about.,24

S08E03 Rachel Tells....txt,Ross,Wow! I thought you would be a little more shocked.,26

S08E03 Rachel Tells....txt,Joey,"Yeah, I don’t think that’s what it is.",27
S08E03 Rachel Tells....txt,Ross,Why? What-what else could it be?,27
S08E03 Rachel Tells....txt,Joey,"Oh wow, I don’t feel well.",27
S08E03 Rachel Tells....txt,Ross,I’m telling you. I’m telling you. That’s what it is. No wonder she was looking at me all funny during the wedding. She didn’t say anything to you?,27
S08E03 Rachel Tells....txt,Joey,"Please, just-just, just go and talk to Rachel.",28
S08E03 Rachel Tells....txt,Monica,They’re kissing let’s just go around them.,31

S08E03 Rachel Tells....txt,Chandler,"25J and K, any chance those aren’t together?",36
S08E03 Rachel Tells....txt,Joey,I still can’t believe they took away my key. You trust me with yours.,37

S08E03 Rachel Tells....txt,Joey,What the hell is that?,38
S08E03 Rachel Tells....txt,Joey,"Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Treeger, what are you doing?",38

S08E03 Rachel Tells....txt,Ross,"I mean look, that-that one night we had was fun and…and certainly passionate, but don’t you think it’s better if we just stayed friends?",54
S08E03 Rachel Tells....txt,Rachel,Seriously. What?!,54
S08E03 Rachel Tells....txt,Ross,"Okay. Okay. Y’know what? If you want to, we can do it one more time. I mean I’d-I’d be okay with that. In fact, I have some time right now.",54
S08E03 Rachel Tells....txt,Rachel,"Okay, y’know what? Can I, can I talk now?",54

S08E03 Rachel Tells....txt,Ross,What? What? What?!! Well they should put that on the box!!!,59
S08E03 Rachel Tells....txt,Rachel,They do!,59
S08E03 Rachel Tells....txt,Rachel,Okay Ross come on let’s just forget about the condoms.,60
S08E03 Rachel Tells....txt,Ross,Oh well I may as well have!,60
S08E03 Rachel Tells....txt,Rachel,"Listen, y’know what? I was really freaked out too when I found out…",60
S08E03 Rachel Tells....txt,Ross,"Freaked out? Hey no, I’m not freaked out! I’m indignant! As a consumer!",60
S08E03 Rachel Tells....txt,Rachel,"Y’know what? Let’s, let’s talk later.",60
S08E03 Rachel Tells....txt,Phoebe,"Oh great! And listen, could you do us a favor and not tell Chandler and Monica about this? ‘Cause y’know umm, they don’t-they don’t have any kids of their own and-and this door was like a child to them.",67
S08E03 Rachel Tells....txt,Phoebe,Oh no.,67
S08E03 Rachel Tells....txt,Ross,Hi.,68
S08E03 Rachel Tells....txt,Ross,Sure.,68
S08E03 Rachel Tells....txt,Ross,Oh my God! What happened to the door?!,71

S08E03 Rachel Tells....txt,Phoebe,A little bit.,74
S08E03 Rachel Tells....txt,Joey,How are you doing?,74
S08E03 Rachel Tells....txt,Ross,Okay. Okay. I mean I’ll be okay. It’s just I don’t think I handled it very well.,74
S08E03 Rachel Tells....txt,Joey,"Well, what did you say to her?",74
S08E03 Rachel Tells....txt,Ross,Nothing. But the complaint department at the condom company got an earful. And then when I turned around she was gone.,74
S08E03 Rachel Tells....txt,Phoebe,Oh Ross.,74
S08E03 Rachel Tells....txt,Ross,"But hey, in my defense I-I just found out condoms are like only 97% effective.",74
S08E03 Rachel Tells....txt,Ross,I gotta go find her.,75
S08E03 Rachel Tells....txt,Joey,Whoa! Hey! Whoa!! Hold up! Are you serious?! So like 3% of the time they don’t even work?! Huh? They should put that on the box!,75
S08E03 Rachel Tells....txt,Ross,Evidently they do.,75
S08E03 Rachel Tells....txt,Monica,I can’t believe we’re here.,77
S08E03 Rachel Tells....txt,Chandler,Oh you’ve got to be kidding me.,77
S08E03 Rachel Tells....txt,Monica,No!! You have been screwing us all day!,78

S08E03 Rachel Tells....txt,Chandler,We’re you just ten seconds later!,78
S08E03 Rachel Tells....txt,Monica,Yeah! You already got the first class tickets; you got the lounge! I mean we should get free stuff too! I mean you’re not the only ones on your honeymoon!,78
S08E03 Rachel Tells....txt,Woman,Well you can have the suite if you want. We don’t care about where we stay. We’re here to celebrate our love together. We don’t have to get free stuff. We just want to be together.,78
S08E03 Rachel Tells....txt,Joey,"Hey Monica it’s Joey. Listen uh, Phoebe and I smell gas comin’ from your apartment.",80
S08E03 Rachel Tells....txt,Chandler,What else is new?,81
S08E03 Rachel Tells....txt,Joey,"Yeah and we’d go check it out, but you took away our keys.",81
S08E03 Rachel Tells....txt,Monica,Well do something! Get in there!,81
S08E03 Rachel Tells....txt,Joey,How? I guess I could break down your door.,81
S08E03 Rachel Tells....txt,Monica,Yeah! Do that!,81
S08E03 Rachel Tells....txt,Nurse,"Okay Rachel, are you comfortable?",86

S08E03 Rachel Tells....txt,Rachel,Okay. Head Ross! Head Ross! Head Ross!,91
S08E03 Rachel Tells....txt,Ross,"Right! Right! I just—I want you to know that I’m going to be there through this whole thing, okay? Okay? The doctor’s appointments, the uh, the Lamaze classes, uh baby-proofing the apartment—Although we could probably worry about that ‘til after we get married.",91
S08E03 Rachel Tells....txt,Rachel,What married?,91
S08E03 Rachel Tells....txt,Ross,"Well yeah, I think we should get married.",91
S08E03 Rachel Tells....txt,Rachel,"What, because that’s your answer to everything?",91
S08E03 Rachel Tells....txt,Ross,"No, because that’s the right thing to do.",91
S08E03 Rachel Tells....txt,Rachel,"Yeah, maybe if you’re in love. But Ross, we are not in love, are we?",91
S08E03 Rachel Tells....txt,Ross,No but…but still you can’t possibly do this alone.,91
S08E03 Rachel Tells....txt,Rachel,Excuse me?,91
S08E03 Rachel Tells....txt,Ross,"Come on Rach, you can’t even eat alone in a restaurant.",91
S08E03 Rachel Tells....txt,Rachel,What?!,91
S08E03 Rachel Tells....txt,Ross,"I’m just saying if you can’t eat by yourself, how do you expect to have a baby by yourself?",91
S08E03 Rachel Tells....txt,Rachel,I can too eat by myself!,91
S08E03 Rachel Tells....txt,Ross,When have you ever?,91
S08E03 Rachel Tells....txt,Rachel,When certain people leave the table and I am not finished!,91
S08E03 Rachel Tells....txt,Ross,Well certain other people take two hours to eat a bowl of soup!,91
S08E03 Rachel Tells....txt,Rachel,"Oh please, you inhale your food!",91
S08E03 Rachel Tells....txt,Ross,I grew up with Monica! If you didn’t eat fast you didn’t eat!!,91
S08E03 Rachel Tells....txt,Rachel,"Oh no Dr. Long, please come in. This is Ross, he is the father.",92
S08E03 Rachel Tells....txt,Ross,"But not the husband, because evidently she can do this alone.",92
S08E03 Rachel Tells....txt,Rachel,I do need you! I need you to stand near my head!,93
S08E03 Rachel Tells....txt,Ross,Oh my God.,94
S08E03 Rachel Tells....txt,Rachel,"Wow. There it is, I see it.",94

S05E04 Phoebe Hates PBS.txt,Monica,"Uh-huh, that one!",8
S05E04 Phoebe Hates PBS.txt,Rachel,Why aren't you guys at the movie?,10
S05E04 Phoebe Hates PBS.txt,Joey,"Well, we were! But Ross was talking so loud on his phone they threw us out!",10
S05E04 Phoebe Hates PBS.txt,Ross,I had to talk loud because the movie was loud!,10
S05E04 Phoebe Hates PBS.txt,Monica,But why?! Did he get in touch with Emily?,11
S05E04 Phoebe Hates PBS.txt,Joey,"Well no, not yet. He's calling everyone on her side of the family hoping that someone will help him get in touch with her.",11
S05E04 Phoebe Hates PBS.txt,Joey,Ross! Way to suck up to the family.,12
S05E04 Phoebe Hates PBS.txt,Chandler,"Oh no-no-no-no-no-no, vomit tux! No-no, vomit tux!",15
S05E04 Phoebe Hates PBS.txt,Joey,"Don't worry, I had it dry-cleaned.",15
S05E04 Phoebe Hates PBS.txt,Monica,"Vomit tux? Who vomited on—y'know what, what you up to Joe?",15
S05E04 Phoebe Hates PBS.txt,Joey,"Well, I'm doing this telethon thing on TV and my agent got me a job as co-host!",15
S05E04 Phoebe Hates PBS.txt,Monica,Oh that's great!,15
S05E04 Phoebe Hates PBS.txt,Joey,"A little uh, good deed for PBS and a little TV exposure, now that's the kind of math Joey likes to do!",15
S05E04 Phoebe Hates PBS.txt,Phoebe,"Ugh, PBS!",15
S05E04 Phoebe Hates PBS.txt,Monica,What's wrong with PBS?,15
S05E04 Phoebe Hates PBS.txt,Phoebe,"Ugh, what's right with them?",15
S05E04 Phoebe Hates PBS.txt,Joey,"Why don’t you like PBS, Pheebs?",15
S05E04 Phoebe Hates PBS.txt,Phoebe,"Okay, 'cause right after my mom killed herself, I was just in this really bad place, y'know personally. So, I just thought that it'd make me feel better if I wrote to Sesame Street, 'cause they were so nice when I was a little kid! No one ever wrote back.",15
S05E04 Phoebe Hates PBS.txt,Chandler,Well y'know a lot of those Muppets don't have thumbs.,15
S05E04 Phoebe Hates PBS.txt,Phoebe,All I got was a lousy key chain! And by that time I was living in a box. I didn't have keys!,15
S05E04 Phoebe Hates PBS.txt,Joey,"I'm sorry Pheebs, I just, y'know, I just wanted to do a good deed. Like-like you did with the babies.",15
S05E04 Phoebe Hates PBS.txt,Phoebe,"This isn't a good deed, you just wanted to get on TV! This is totally selfish.",15
S05E04 Phoebe Hates PBS.txt,Joey,"Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! What about you, having those babies for your brother? Talk about selfish!",15
S05E04 Phoebe Hates PBS.txt,Phoebe,What-what are you talking about?!,15
S05E04 Phoebe Hates PBS.txt,Joey,"Well, yeah, it was a really nice thing and all, but it made you feel really good right?",15
S05E04 Phoebe Hates PBS.txt,Phoebe,Yeah. So?,15
S05E04 Phoebe Hates PBS.txt,Joey,"It made you feel good, so that makes it selfish. Look, there's no unselfish good deeds, sorry.",15
S05E04 Phoebe Hates PBS.txt,Phoebe,Yes there are! There are totally good deeds that are selfless.,15
S05E04 Phoebe Hates PBS.txt,Joey,"Well, may I ask for one example?",15
S05E04 Phoebe Hates PBS.txt,Phoebe,"Yeah, it's… Y'know there's—no you may not!",15
S05E04 Phoebe Hates PBS.txt,Joey,That's because all people are selfish.,16
S05E04 Phoebe Hates PBS.txt,Phoebe,Are you calling me selfish?!,16
S05E04 Phoebe Hates PBS.txt,Phoebe,"I'm gonna find a selfless good dead. I'm gonna beat you, you evil genius.",17
S05E04 Phoebe Hates PBS.txt,Emily,"Ross, I'm only ringing to say stop harassing my relatives. Good-bye!",21
S05E04 Phoebe Hates PBS.txt,Ross,"No wait! Look, wait! Okay, you can hang up, but I'm gonna keep calling! I'm gonna, I'm gonna call everyone in England if that's what it takes to get you to talk to me!",21
S05E04 Phoebe Hates PBS.txt,Emily,Really? About what?,21
S05E04 Phoebe Hates PBS.txt,Ross,Look you're my wife. We're-we're married. Y'know? I-I love you. I-I really miss you.,21
S05E04 Phoebe Hates PBS.txt,Emily,"I miss you to. Well, at least I think I do.",21
S05E04 Phoebe Hates PBS.txt,Phoebe,"Hey, Joey, when you said the deal with Santa Clause, you meant?",23
S05E04 Phoebe Hates PBS.txt,Joey,That he doesn't exist.,23
S05E04 Phoebe Hates PBS.txt,Rachel,"So Chandler, have you heard about Monica's secret boyfriend?",25
S05E04 Phoebe Hates PBS.txt,Chandler,"Uhh, yeah. She uh, she uh, she uh might've mentioned him.",25
S05E04 Phoebe Hates PBS.txt,Rachel,"So Mon, when are we gonna meet this new secret waiter man?",25
S05E04 Phoebe Hates PBS.txt,Monica,"Ohh, he's really shy. I-I don’t think he's up to meeting everyone yet.",25
S05E04 Phoebe Hates PBS.txt,Chandler,"Yeah, I don't think he's up to meeting everyone yet.",25
S05E04 Phoebe Hates PBS.txt,Rachel,I don’t care! I wanna meet this guy who's the best sex she ever had!,25
S05E04 Phoebe Hates PBS.txt,Monica,Hey!,30
S05E04 Phoebe Hates PBS.txt,Ross,"Well, Emily's willing to work on the relationship.",30
S05E04 Phoebe Hates PBS.txt,Chandler,Yes!,30
S05E04 Phoebe Hates PBS.txt,Monica,That's great!,30
S05E04 Phoebe Hates PBS.txt,Ross,In London!,30
S05E04 Phoebe Hates PBS.txt,Monica,What?!,30
S05E04 Phoebe Hates PBS.txt,Ross,She wants me to move to London.,30
S05E04 Phoebe Hates PBS.txt,Rachel,What-what-what are you gonna do?,31
S05E04 Phoebe Hates PBS.txt,Ross,I bet if I talk to Carol and Susan I can convince them to move to London with Ben.,31
S05E04 Phoebe Hates PBS.txt,Monica,"Yeah, I'm sure your ex-wife will be more than happy to move to another country so you can patch things up with your new wife.",31
S05E04 Phoebe Hates PBS.txt,Ross,It could happen.,31
S05E04 Phoebe Hates PBS.txt,Joey,"That's great. But uh, I'm not really expecting a lot of calls.",33
S05E04 Phoebe Hates PBS.txt,Joey,But I'm the host!,33
S05E04 Phoebe Hates PBS.txt,Joey,"You don't seem to understand. See, I was Dr. Drake Remoray.",33
S05E04 Phoebe Hates PBS.txt,Phoebe,"I cannot believe I can't find a selfless good deed! Y'know that old guy that lives next to me? Well, I snuck over there and-and raked up all the leaves on his front stoop. But he caught me and force-fed me cider and cookies. Then I felt wonderful. That old jackass!",35
S05E04 Phoebe Hates PBS.txt,Rachel,Maybe Joey's right. Maybe all good deeds are selfish.,35
S05E04 Phoebe Hates PBS.txt,Phoebe,I will find a selfless good deed! 'Cause I just gave birth to three children and I will not let them be raised in a world where Joey is right!,35
S05E04 Phoebe Hates PBS.txt,Monica,Sure!,36
S05E04 Phoebe Hates PBS.txt,Chandler,"If you're cooking on the stove, does that mean that your new secret boyfriend is better in bed than Richard?",36
S05E04 Phoebe Hates PBS.txt,Monica,"Well, y'know I-I-I think I'm gonna respect the privacy of my new secret boyfriend.",37
S05E04 Phoebe Hates PBS.txt,Ross,"All right Emily, as much as I love you, I'm sorry, I can't move to London without Ben.",39
S05E04 Phoebe Hates PBS.txt,Emily,I understand that would be difficult.,39
S05E04 Phoebe Hates PBS.txt,Ross,"Yeah, would you please consider moving here? I mean you were gonna move here anyway, why can't you just do that?",39
S05E04 Phoebe Hates PBS.txt,Emily,"I don't know, it's just…",39
S05E04 Phoebe Hates PBS.txt,Ross,"Oh-oh-okay, but-but I know, that even though I've been a-a complete idiot up 'til now, I mean, I mean you-you-you have to come here. You have to come here so we can work this out.",39

S06E12 The Joke.txt,Ross,"Hey, you’re not going to believe this. I made up a joke and sent it in to Playboy. They printed it!",2
S06E12 The Joke.txt,Phoebe,I didn’t know Playboy prints jokes.,2
S06E12 The Joke.txt,Ross,"Yeah, they print jokes, interviews, hard-hitting journalism. It’s not just about the pictures.",2
S06E12 The Joke.txt,Monica,"That didn’t work on mom, it’s not going to work on us.",2
S06E12 The Joke.txt,Chandler,That is funny. It was also funny when I made it up.,4
S06E12 The Joke.txt,Ross,What?,4
S06E12 The Joke.txt,Chandler,I made that joke up.,4
S06E12 The Joke.txt,Ross,"Uh, oh-oh, no you didn’t. I did.",4
S06E12 The Joke.txt,Chandler,"Yes, I did. I told it to Dan at work, and he said it was the funniest joke he’d ever heard.",4
S06E12 The Joke.txt,Ross,"Hey, tell Dan, ‘Thanks.’",4
S06E12 The Joke.txt,Ross,What?,5
S06E12 The Joke.txt,Chandler,"Monica, you remember me telling you that joke, right?",6
S06E12 The Joke.txt,Monica,No.,6
S06E12 The Joke.txt,Chandler,Seriously?,6
S06E12 The Joke.txt,Monica,"Well, you tell a lot of jokes!",6
S06E12 The Joke.txt,Ross,"Look, Chandler, it’s my joke. But, hey, if it makes you feel any better they don’t print the name, so it doesn’t really matter who gets credit, right?",6
S06E12 The Joke.txt,Chandler,"Yeah, I guess.",6
S06E12 The Joke.txt,Ross,"No, it’s my joke, it’s mine. You can call them, they’ll tell you.",8
S06E12 The Joke.txt,Chandler,It’s my joke.,8
S06E12 The Joke.txt,Ross,It’s my joke.,8
S06E12 The Joke.txt,Joey,"Whoa-whoa-whoa. Jokes? You guys know they have naked chicks in there, right?",8
S06E12 The Joke.txt,Chandler,"Dude, you have got to turn on Behind the Music. The band Heart is having a really tough time, and I think they may break up.",9
S06E12 The Joke.txt,Joey,Let’s go watch it at your place.,9
S06E12 The Joke.txt,Chandler,"Nah, Monica’s watching some cooking show. Come on, I don’t want to miss when they were skinny.",9
S06E12 The Joke.txt,Joey,"Chandler, Chandler, y’know what we should do? You and I should go out and get some new sunglasses.",9
S06E12 The Joke.txt,Joey,"No, that’s VH-1. I gotta tell you, the music these kids listen to today . . . It’s like a lotta noise to me. I don’t know…",10
S06E12 The Joke.txt,Chandler,"Joey, why is your cable out?",10
S06E12 The Joke.txt,Joey,"I uh, oh! Because, uh, I haven’t really paid the bill",10
S06E12 The Joke.txt,Chandler,"If you need money, will you please-please just let me loan you some money?",10
S06E12 The Joke.txt,Joey,"No, Chandler. Look, forget about it, okay? Look, I know things have been a little tight since Janine moved out. Oh, was she hot.",10
S06E12 The Joke.txt,Chandler,Whoa ho.,10
S06E12 The Joke.txt,Joey,Sure.,12
S06E12 The Joke.txt,Joey,Not so much.,13
S06E12 The Joke.txt,Phoebe,Wh-wh-what are you doing?,16
S06E12 The Joke.txt,Rachel,We are looking at a Playboy.,16
S06E12 The Joke.txt,Monica,"So do you think that these pictures—Are, are they trying to tell a story?",17
S06E12 The Joke.txt,Rachel,"Oh, yeah, sure. I mean, like in the case of this young woman, she has lost her clothes, so she rides naked on the horse, she’s crying out, ‘Where are they, where are they?’",17
S06E12 The Joke.txt,Monica,"Well, she’s not going to find them lying in the grass like that.",17
S06E12 The Joke.txt,Phoebe,"Oh, yeah. Aw, remember the days when you used to go out to the barn, lift up your shirt, and bend over?",18
S06E12 The Joke.txt,Rachel,"You see, now, I would date this girl. She’s cute, she’s outdoorsy, you know, and she knows how to build a fire. I mean, that’s got to come in handy",18
S06E12 The Joke.txt,Monica,"Okay, I’ve got a question. If you had to pick one of us to date, who would it be?",18
S06E12 The Joke.txt,Monica,Me neither.,19
S06E12 The Joke.txt,Phoebe,Rachel.,19
S06E12 The Joke.txt,Monica,What?!,19
S06E12 The Joke.txt,Joey,You forget how many great songs Heart had.,21
S06E12 The Joke.txt,Chandler,Yeah.,21
S06E12 The Joke.txt,Ross,"You know, Barracuda was the first song I learned to play on the keyboard.",21
S06E12 The Joke.txt,Chandler,"So, you heard it, you repeated it, so that must mean you wrote it.",21
S06E12 The Joke.txt,Joey,"Oh, you guys, with this joke. I gotta say, I know I cracked up, but I’m not even sure I got it.",21
S06E12 The Joke.txt,Ross,"What, you didn’t get it? The doctor is a monkey.",21
S06E12 The Joke.txt,Chandler,And monkeys can’t write out prescriptions.,22
S06E12 The Joke.txt,Ross,"Your joke? Well, I think ‘the Hef’ would disagree, which is why he sent me a check for one hundred ah-dollars.",24
S06E12 The Joke.txt,Chandler,"So, you stole my joke, and you stole my money.",24
S06E12 The Joke.txt,Ross,"Well, I was going to stick it in the ATM, but now I think I’ll show the sexy teller that I am a published writer.",24
S06E12 The Joke.txt,Chandler,"Well, she is going to know that you stole the joke.",24
S06E12 The Joke.txt,Ross,"Oh, what are you going to do, follow me down there?",24
S06E12 The Joke.txt,Chandler,Yeah!,24
S06E12 The Joke.txt,Joey,"Ah, Gunther, I can’t pay for this right now because I’m not working, so I’ve had to cut down on some luxuries like uh, payin’ for stuff.",28
S06E12 The Joke.txt,Gunther,"Well, if you want, you can work here.",28
S06E12 The Joke.txt,Joey,"Uh, I don’t know. Ya see, it’s just, see I was a regular on a soap opera y’know? And to go from that to this, I just… Plus, I’d have to wait on all my friends.",28
S06E12 The Joke.txt,Gunther,"Okay, but the money’s good, plus you get to stare at Rachel as much as you want.",28
S06E12 The Joke.txt,Joey,What?!,28
S06E12 The Joke.txt,Gunther,Flexible hours.,28
S06E12 The Joke.txt,Joey,Maybe I could be a waiter. Could I use the phone?,28
S06E12 The Joke.txt,Monica,It’s wrong. You know what else is wrong? Phoebe picking Rachel.,31
S06E12 The Joke.txt,Chandler,"You know who else picked Rachel? Ross, and you know what else Ross did? He stole my joke. You know what? I’m going to get a joke journal. Y’know? And document the date and time of every single one of my jokes.",31
S06E12 The Joke.txt,Monica,That’s a good idea.,31
S06E12 The Joke.txt,Chandler,Yeah!,31
S06E12 The Joke.txt,Monica,Do you know what’s a bad idea?,31
S06E12 The Joke.txt,Chandler,Picking Rachel.,31
S06E12 The Joke.txt,Chandler,Maybe it’s the sound of Ross climbing into my brain and stealing my thoughts.,32
S06E12 The Joke.txt,Monica,It’s coming from the living room.,32
S06E12 The Joke.txt,Rachel,"Monica, what are you doing?",37
S06E12 The Joke.txt,Phoebe,I guess it was kinda funny.,38
S06E12 The Joke.txt,Phoebe,Fine. The reason that I was leaning a little bit more toward Rachel than you is just that you’re … just … kinda high maintenance—Okay let’s go to lunch!,39
S06E12 The Joke.txt,Monica,"That is completely untrue. You think I’m high maintenance? Okay, prove it. I want you to make a list and we’re going to go through it point by point!",39
S06E12 The Joke.txt,Phoebe,"No, okay, you’re right. You’re easy-going. You’re just not as easy-going as Rachel. She’s just more flexible and-and mellow. That’s all.",39
S06E12 The Joke.txt,Phoebe,"Ya, you know, Rachel … she’ll do whatever you want. Y’know, you can just walk all over her.",40
S06E12 The Joke.txt,Rachel,"What? Wait a minute. What are you saying, that I’m a pushover? I’m not a pushover.",40
S06E12 The Joke.txt,Rachel,I cannot believe her.,44
S06E12 The Joke.txt,Monica,I know. Where do you wanna go eat?,44
S06E12 The Joke.txt,Rachel,"Oh, oh, I love that Japanese place.",44
S06E12 The Joke.txt,Monica,I’m sick of Japanese. We’re not going there.,44
S06E12 The Joke.txt,Rachel,"All right, wherever you wanna go is cool.",44
S06E12 The Joke.txt,Monica,All right.,44
S06E12 The Joke.txt,Gunther,"Yeah, that-that Chandler cracks me up.",47
S06E12 The Joke.txt,Joey,"Hey Ross, listen, you want anything to drink, ‘cause I’m heading up there.",48
S06E12 The Joke.txt,Ross,"Uh, yeah, I’ll take a coffee. Thanks, man.",48
S06E12 The Joke.txt,Rachel,No.,49
S06E12 The Joke.txt,Monica,"No, thank you.",49
S06E12 The Joke.txt,Woman,I’d love an ice water.,50
S06E12 The Joke.txt,Joey,You got it.,50
S06E12 The Joke.txt,Monica,"Joey, what are you doing?",50
S06E12 The Joke.txt,Rachel,"Joey, honey, I don’t think you’re supposed to go back there.",51
S06E12 The Joke.txt,Gunther,Don’t wink at me. And put on your apron.,52
S06E12 The Joke.txt,Joey,"Okay, but I don’t see you asking any other paying customers to put on aprons.",52
S06E12 The Joke.txt,Monica,"Joey, do you work here?",52
S06E12 The Joke.txt,Joey,No.,52
S06E12 The Joke.txt,Customer,"Hey, waiter.",52
S06E12 The Joke.txt,Joey,Yeah?,52
S06E12 The Joke.txt,Monica,"Joey, what’s going on. What didn’t you tell us you work here?",53
S06E12 The Joke.txt,Joey,"It’s kind of embarrassing, y’know. I mean, I was an actor and now I’m a waiter. It’s supposed to go in the other direction.",53
S06E12 The Joke.txt,Chandler,So is your apron. You’re wearing it like a cape.,53
S06E12 The Joke.txt,Joey,"I mean, the job’s easy and the money’s good, you know? I guess I’m going to be hanging out here anyway. I might as well get paid for it, right? I just feel kind of weird serving you guys.",53
S06E12 The Joke.txt,Rachel,"Come on, Joey, I did it and it was fine.",53
S06E12 The Joke.txt,Ross,"Yeah, why would it be weird? Hey, Joey, can I get some coffee?",53
S06E12 The Joke.txt,Joey,"Okay, I guess it doesn’t seem that weird.",53
S06E12 The Joke.txt,Ross,"Seriously, I-I asked you before and you still haven’t gotten it.",53
S06E12 The Joke.txt,Joey,"See, now it’s weird again.",53
S06E12 The Joke.txt,Joey,"Thanks, Rach. Look, you guys are just terrific. Y’know? Now, how about clearing out of here so I can get some new customers. It’s all about turnover.",55
S06E12 The Joke.txt,Ross,"Joey, seriously, can I get my coffee?",55
S06E12 The Joke.txt,Joey,"Oh, I’m sorry, Ross. I’ll get it for you right now. And since I made you wait, I’ll toss in a free muffin.",55
S06E12 The Joke.txt,Rachel,Phoebe. We would like to talk to you for a second.,57
S06E12 The Joke.txt,Phoebe,Okay.,57
S06E12 The Joke.txt,Monica,"So, maybe I am a little high maintenance. And maybe Rachel is a little bit of a pushover. But you know what we decided you are?",57
S06E12 The Joke.txt,Rachel,"Yes, we are very sorry to tell you this, but you, Phoebe, are flaky.",57
S06E12 The Joke.txt,Monica,Hah!,57
S06E12 The Joke.txt,Phoebe,"That true, I am flaky.",57
S06E12 The Joke.txt,Rachel,"So, what, you’re just, you’re just okay with being flaky?",57
S06E12 The Joke.txt,Phoebe,"Yeah, totally.",57
S06E12 The Joke.txt,Monica,"Well, then, I’m okay with being high maintenance.",57
S06E12 The Joke.txt,Rachel,"Yeah, and I am okay with being a pushover.",57
S06E12 The Joke.txt,Phoebe,That’s great. Good for you guys.,57
S06E12 The Joke.txt,Monica,I am not high maintenance!,57
S06E12 The Joke.txt,Rachel,I am not a pushover!,57
S06E12 The Joke.txt,Phoebe,Who said you were?,57
S06E12 The Joke.txt,Phoebe,"Oh, I’m flaky. I’ll say anything.",57
S06E12 The Joke.txt,Joey,"Hey, Gunther. Can you uh, can you cover for me? I just got an audition.",58
S06E12 The Joke.txt,Gunther,"No, I’m leaving to get my hair dyed.",58
S06E12 The Joke.txt,Joey,"Really?! I like your natural color. Come on man, it’s a great part. Look, check it out. I’m the lead guy’s best friend and I wait for him in this bar and save his seat. Listen-listen. ‘I’m sorry, that seat’s saved.’",58
S06E12 The Joke.txt,Gunther,That’s the whole part?,58
S06E12 The Joke.txt,Joey,"Okay, maybe he’s not his best friend, but …",58
S06E12 The Joke.txt,Gunther,"Okay, I’ll see you in an hour.",58
S06E12 The Joke.txt,Joey,"Oh, man, I could totally get that part. ‘I’m sorry, that seat is taken.’",58
S06E12 The Joke.txt,Patron,"Oh, excuse me.",58
S06E12 The Joke.txt,Joey,"No, no, I didn’t mean you. But, you believed me, huh?",58
S06E12 The Joke.txt,Patron,I believed you were saving this seat for someone.,58
S06E12 The Joke.txt,Joey,"So, you’d hire me, right?",58
S06E12 The Joke.txt,Patron,For what?,58
S06E12 The Joke.txt,Joey,"Exactly! All right, everybody, listen up. The coffeehouse is going to be closed for about an hour.",58
S06E12 The Joke.txt,Customers,Huh? What?,58
S06E12 The Joke.txt,Joey,"Yeah, it’s for the kids. To keep the kids off drugs. It’s a very important issue in this month’s Playboy. I’m sure you all read about it.",58
S06E12 The Joke.txt,Ross,It’s my joke.,59
S06E12 The Joke.txt,Chandler,It’s my joke.,59
S06E12 The Joke.txt,Ross,"Y’know, I don’t think we’re going to settle this.",59
S06E12 The Joke.txt,Chandler,Let’s have Monica decide.,59
S06E12 The Joke.txt,Ross,Yeah!,59
S06E12 The Joke.txt,Chandler,Yeah!,59
S06E12 The Joke.txt,Ross,Hey Mon.,59
S06E12 The Joke.txt,Chandler,"Mon, get out here!",59
S06E12 The Joke.txt,Chandler,"Okay, okay. You have to help us decide whose joke this is.",60
S06E12 The Joke.txt,Monica,Why do I have to decide?,60
S06E12 The Joke.txt,Chandler,Because you’re the only one that can be fair.,60
S06E12 The Joke.txt,Ross,Yeah.,60
S06E12 The Joke.txt,Monica,I can’t be fair. You’re my boyfriend.,60
S06E12 The Joke.txt,Ross,"Yeah, but I’m your brother. We’re family. That’s the most important thing in the world.",60
S06E12 The Joke.txt,Ross,We’ll each tell you how we came up with the joke and then you decide which one of us is telling the truth—me.,61
S06E12 The Joke.txt,Monica,"Okay, Chandler, you go first.",61
S06E12 The Joke.txt,Chandler,"Okay, I thought of the joke two months ago at lunch with Steve.",61
S06E12 The Joke.txt,Monica,"Oh, wait, is he the guy I met at Christmas?",61
S06E12 The Joke.txt,Chandler,Can I finish my story?!,61
S06E12 The Joke.txt,Monica,Do you want me to pick you?!,61
S06E12 The Joke.txt,Ross,"See, I would never snap at you like that.",61
S06E12 The Joke.txt,Monica,Continue.,62
S06E12 The Joke.txt,Ross,"Are you kidding? Okay, look. I-I studied evolution. Remember, evolution? Monkey into man? Plus, I’m a doctor, and I had a monkey. I’m Doctor Monkey!",63
S06E12 The Joke.txt,Chandler,I’m not arguing with that.,63
S06E12 The Joke.txt,Monica,"All right, I’ve heard enough. I’ve made my decision.",63
S06E12 The Joke.txt,Monica,"You are both idiots. The joke is not funny, and it’s offensive to women, and doctors, and monkeys! You shouldn’t be arguing over who gets credit, you should be arguing over who gets blamed for inflicting this horrible joke upon the world! Now let it go! The joke sucks!",64
S06E12 The Joke.txt,Ross,It’s your joke.,65
S06E12 The Joke.txt,Chandler,Is not.,65
S06E12 The Joke.txt,Monica,"Hi, Chandler. There you are.",66
S06E12 The Joke.txt,Chandler,"Hi, oh hi.",66
S06E12 The Joke.txt,Monica,"Hey, it’s Phoebe and Rachel. Um, why don’t you tell them what you were telling me earlier about me not being high maintenance?",66
S06E12 The Joke.txt,Rachel,"Wow, you know what? That is the best fake speech I think I’ve ever heard.",68
S06E12 The Joke.txt,Phoebe,Really? I’ve heard better.,68
S06E12 The Joke.txt,Monica,"Wait, wait, he came up with that himself. Tell them, Chandler.",68
S06E12 The Joke.txt,Monica,"Look, I am not high maintenance. I am not. Chandler!",69
S06E12 The Joke.txt,Monica,Ahhh! You are on my list.,70
S06E12 The Joke.txt,Chandler,"I’m sorry. You’re not easy-going, but you’re passionate, and that’s good. And when you get upset about the little things, I think that I’m pretty good about making you feel better about that. And that’s good too. So, they can say that you’re high maintenance, but it’s okay, because I like … maintaining you.",70
S06E12 The Joke.txt,Chandler,"Hey, buddy boy, how’d the audition go?",75
S06E12 The Joke.txt,Joey,"Not good, no. I didn’t get the part, and I lost my job here, so …",75
S06E12 The Joke.txt,Phoebe,Wow! That is a bad audition.,75
S06E12 The Joke.txt,Rachel,How-how did you lose your job here?,75
S06E12 The Joke.txt,Joey,"Well, I had the audition but Gunther said I had to stay here and be in charge so he could go get his hair dyed. So, I went anyway, and then he fired me.",75
S06E12 The Joke.txt,Rachel,"He left work in the middle of the day to do a personal errand and left you in charge when you’ve been working here two days? That’s not, that’s not right.",75
S06E12 The Joke.txt,Joey,"Yeah, what are ya gonna do?",75
S06E12 The Joke.txt,Gunther,Okay.,76
S06E12 The Joke.txt,Rachel,What?,76
S06E12 The Joke.txt,Gunther,He can have his job back.,76
S06E12 The Joke.txt,Rachel,"That’s right, he can have his job back. I’m glad we got that all straightened out. There you go, Joey, you got your job back.",76
S06E12 The Joke.txt,Joey,That’s great. Thanks Rach.,76
S06E12 The Joke.txt,Rachel,"Yeah, pretty nice, huh? Now who’s a pushover?",76
S06E12 The Joke.txt,Phoebe,"Hey, I never got to hear who you guys would pick to be your girlfriend.",79
S06E12 The Joke.txt,Monica,"I pick you, Phoebe.",79
S06E12 The Joke.txt,Rachel,"Oh, yeah. Definitely you, Pheebs.",79
S06E12 The Joke.txt,Phoebe,"Yeah, well, I kinda thought.",79
S06E12 The Joke.txt,Chandler,Hey.,81
S06E12 The Joke.txt,Rachel,"Hey. Oh, I have a question. If-if-if one of you had to pick one of the other two guys to go out with, who would you pick?",81
S06E12 The Joke.txt,Ross,No way.,81
S06E12 The Joke.txt,Joey,I’m not answering that.,81
S08E09 The Rumor.txt,Joey,"Hey Rach listen, did you know that during pregnancy your fingers swell up to twice their size and never go back.",2
S08E09 The Rumor.txt,Rachel,Hi!,5
S08E09 The Rumor.txt,Rachel,No.,9
S08E09 The Rumor.txt,Monica,"He was in Ross’s class…marching band…kinda overweight? Well, really overweight. I mean I was his thin friend.",9
S08E09 The Rumor.txt,Rachel,"Wow! I don’t remember him. Honey, are you sure you’re not talking about your imaginary boyfriend.",9
S08E09 The Rumor.txt,Rachel,Oh that’s nice.,10
S08E09 The Rumor.txt,Joey,I just want you to say it once in a while.,11
S08E09 The Rumor.txt,Monica,"All right okay, just so you know, I’m not gonna make a turkey this year.",11
S08E09 The Rumor.txt,Joey,What?!,11
S08E09 The Rumor.txt,Monica,Well Phoebe doesn’t eat turkey…,11
S08E09 The Rumor.txt,Joey,Phoebe!,11
S08E09 The Rumor.txt,Phoebe,"Turkey’s are beautiful, intelligent animals!",11
S08E09 The Rumor.txt,Joey,No they’re not! They’re ugly and stupid and delicious!,11
S08E09 The Rumor.txt,Monica,"All right! Okay, it’s just Phoebe. Will’s still on a diet, Chandler doesn’t eat Thanksgiving food, and Rachel’s having her aversion to poultry.",11
S08E09 The Rumor.txt,Joey,She is?,11
S08E09 The Rumor.txt,Rachel,Remember I had to leave the room the other day when you had that roast chicken?,11
S08E09 The Rumor.txt,Joey,Yeah. But I thought that was because I put the whole thing on my hand and made it walk across the table.,11
S08E09 The Rumor.txt,Monica,"Anyway, it just doesn’t seem worth it to make a whole turkey for just three people. Okay? It’s a lot of work.",11
S08E09 The Rumor.txt,Joey,"But you gotta have turkey on Thanksgiving! I mean, Thanksgiving with no turkey is like-like Fourth of July with no apple pie! Or Friday with no two pizzas!",11
S08E09 The Rumor.txt,Monica,All right fine! If it means that much to you! But just—there’s gonna be a ton left over.,11
S08E09 The Rumor.txt,Joey,No there won’t! I promise I will finish that turkey!,11
S08E09 The Rumor.txt,Monica,"All right, you’re telling me you can eat an entire turkey in just one sitting?",11
S08E09 The Rumor.txt,Monica,Hey!,15
S08E09 The Rumor.txt,Phoebe,Happy Thanksgiving!,15
S08E09 The Rumor.txt,Monica,You too!,15
S08E09 The Rumor.txt,Phoebe,Anything I can do to help?,15
S08E09 The Rumor.txt,Phoebe,Sure!,16
S08E09 The Rumor.txt,Monica,I’m gonna go across the hall to check on the yams.,16
S08E09 The Rumor.txt,Monica,"No! No! No! No sweetie! No! Not like that! We’re not at a barn dance. You’ve gotta—you wanna fold them like swans. Like I showed you at Christmas time, remember?",17
S08E09 The Rumor.txt,Chandler,I have no idea.,18
S08E09 The Rumor.txt,Phoebe,What?,18
S08E09 The Rumor.txt,Chandler,Yeah! I’m just pretending to watch the game so I don’t have to help out with stuff.,18
S08E09 The Rumor.txt,Phoebe,I don’t believe you! That is…brilliant! And Monica has no idea?,18
S08E09 The Rumor.txt,Chandler,Nope! Every once and a while I just scream stuff at the TV.,18
S08E09 The Rumor.txt,Monica,Is your team winning hon?,19
S08E09 The Rumor.txt,Phoebe,"Well I want to get in on this. Hey Mon? I don’t think I can help you after all, I didn’t realize this game was on.",20
S08E09 The Rumor.txt,Monica,"Oh, I didn’t know you liked football.",20
S08E09 The Rumor.txt,Monica,You like Green Bay?,21
S08E09 The Rumor.txt,Phoebe,"Well it’s only like my favorite bay! {Actually, it’s not bad. It just gets a little cold in winter, but in Wisconsin winter only lasts from August to June. J }",21
S08E09 The Rumor.txt,Monica,Hey!,22
S08E09 The Rumor.txt,Will,Hey!,22
S08E09 The Rumor.txt,Will,Happy Thanksgiving!,23
S08E09 The Rumor.txt,Monica,Aww thanks! God Will I’m so glad that you came! You look great! You must’ve lost like…,23
S08E09 The Rumor.txt,Will,"150 pounds. Yeah, I’m gonna be in one of those Subway sandwich commercials.",23
S08E09 The Rumor.txt,Will,"Oh right. All right, it’s no fat, it’s no sugar, it’s no dairy…it’s no good. Throw it out.",24
S08E09 The Rumor.txt,Monica,"You wanna meet some people? This is uh; this is my husband Chandler. Chandler, this is Will.",24
S08E09 The Rumor.txt,Will,Hey.,24

S08E09 The Rumor.txt,Ross,"I was working late in the library one afternoon. It was just the two of us. She needed some help with her word jumble. And one thing led to another. If you must know, Anita was very gentle and tender. May she rest in peace…",71

S08E06 The Halloween Party.txt,Eric,She told me she was 25.,101
S08E06 The Halloween Party.txt,Eric,I am so stupid. Of course she was lying! She’s not a teacher. There’s not such a thing as the top secret elementary school for the children of spies.,102

S05E20 The Ride Along.txt,Monica,"Well thank God you were here! I mean, we have to erase that!",41
S05E20 The Ride Along.txt,Rachel,What?! We can't do that!,41
S05E20 The Ride Along.txt,Monica,"We have too! I mean what if Ross's hears that and then calls her back and then they get back together? Is that what you want? Ross back with that controlling, neurotic, crazy Emily? The Emily that wouldn't let him see you?",41
S05E20 The Ride Along.txt,Rachel,Noo! Oh no! No! God no! He should not get back together with her. I know that! You know that! Even Ross knows that! But that still doesn’t give us the right to erase his message!,41
S05E20 The Ride Along.txt,Monica,"I'm his sister, okay? I love him! I don't want to see him get hurt! Come on! Doesn’t that give me the right to control him—help him?",41
S05E20 The Ride Along.txt,Rachel,I don't think he's the one who needs help.,41
S05E20 The Ride Along.txt,Rachel,Ugh!,43
S05E20 The Ride Along.txt,Monica,"Y'know what, this is obviously some kind of twisted joke she's trying to play on him.",43
S05E20 The Ride Along.txt,Rachel,Noooooooo!,44
S05E20 The Ride Along.txt,Chandler,"Okay, y'know, we-we're safe right? I mean nothing bad can go down!",45
S05E20 The Ride Along.txt,Ross,What is it?,46
S05E20 The Ride Along.txt,Gary,"Oh it's nothing, it just says that you can't sue the city if you scrap your knee or y'know, get your head blown off.",46
S05E20 The Ride Along.txt,Gary,"Okay, here he comes. What is he doing? What the hell is he doing?!",47
S05E20 The Ride Along.txt,Ross,What? What? What? What is it?,47

S05E20 The Ride Along.txt,Rachel,"No, Monica! Monica! We have to fix this!",52
S05E20 The Ride Along.txt,Monica,There's nothing we can do. You erased the message!,52
S05E20 The Ride Along.txt,Rachel,Yeah well unless we tell him.,52
S05E20 The Ride Along.txt,Monica,"Well, if you're gonna be totally rational about this, I can't argue with you! All right? Fine, if you wanna tell him, tell him. I just don't want to be a part of it.",52
S05E20 The Ride Along.txt,Rachel,"Oh, maybe that's Emily calling back to leave the exact same message.",53
S05E20 The Ride Along.txt,Monica,Wow! Play that message for Emily and this whole problem goes away!,54
S05E20 The Ride Along.txt,Rachel,Right?,54
S05E20 The Ride Along.txt,Gary,"Hey, anybody want to meet a hero?",55
S05E20 The Ride Along.txt,Gary,"No, Joey!",56
S05E20 The Ride Along.txt,Ross,"Pheebs, we had the most incredible night! Okay, so, we're in the car…",56
S05E20 The Ride Along.txt,Phoebe,Hi!,57
S05E20 The Ride Along.txt,Ross,"Okay, okay, so we're in the car. Right? And bang! A shot was fired. And Joey with no regard for his own safety throws himself on me!",58
S05E20 The Ride Along.txt,Phoebe,"My God, Joey!",58
S05E20 The Ride Along.txt,Ross,"Yeah, but-but he didn't know that!",59
S05E20 The Ride Along.txt,Joey,"Yeah, I didn't know that.",59
S05E20 The Ride Along.txt,Ross,And it could've just as easily have been a bullet.,59
S05E20 The Ride Along.txt,Gary,"Hey Joe, you ever think about joining the force? We could use a guy like you.",59
S05E20 The Ride Along.txt,Chandler,Who jumps at loud noises!,59
S05E20 The Ride Along.txt,Ross,Wow! I could've died tonight.,59
S05E20 The Ride Along.txt,Ross,I do have a newfound respect for life.,60
S05E20 The Ride Along.txt,Gary,Oh yeah? Well maybe you and I should take a walk through a bad neighborhood.,63
S05E20 The Ride Along.txt,Phoebe,Okay!,63
S05E20 The Ride Along.txt,Gary,All right.,63
S05E20 The Ride Along.txt,Phoebe,Bye!,63
S05E20 The Ride Along.txt,Joey,Cut it out Ross! I hate to have to save your life and kick your ass in the same day!,64
S05E20 The Ride Along.txt,Joey,Dude! How come you took off?,65
S05E20 The Ride Along.txt,Chandler,"Oh, I just went for a walk, around the living room. Whatever…",65
S05E20 The Ride Along.txt,Joey,Is something wrong?,65
S05E20 The Ride Along.txt,Chandler,"No. No I'm just tired. Y'know, from-from the walk.",65
S05E20 The Ride Along.txt,Joey,Okay.,65
S05E20 The Ride Along.txt,Chandler,You dove in front of Ross! Ross!,65
S05E20 The Ride Along.txt,Joey,"That's what this is about! Oh my God, you hate Ross!",65
S05E20 The Ride Along.txt,Chandler,I do not hate Ross!,65
S05E20 The Ride Along.txt,Joey,Of course you do! I saved him! You're mad at me! It all adds up! You want Ross out of the picture.,65
S05E20 The Ride Along.txt,Chandler,What picture?,65
S05E20 The Ride Along.txt,Joey,"I don't know, but I don't like what I'm hearing!",65
S05E20 The Ride Along.txt,Chandler,"Look I'm very glad that you saved Ross from the car backfire, but y'know, it could've been a bullet and you y'know, you didn't try to save me!",65
S05E20 The Ride Along.txt,Joey,"Ohh, you're upset because you think I chose Ross over you! No! I…knew…you could take care of yourself. Y'know, I mean Ross, he need help. He's not street like us!",65
S05E20 The Ride Along.txt,Chandler,"When it comes down to it, you would risk your life for Ross before you would for me. That's the bottom line.",65
S05E20 The Ride Along.txt,Joey,"Well, no, not exactly! All right, look, I, I wasn't trying to save Ross. Okay? My sandwich was next to Ross. All right? I was, I was trying to save my sandwich.",65
S05E20 The Ride Along.txt,Chandler,From a bullet!,65
S05E20 The Ride Along.txt,Joey,I know it doesn't make much sense…,65
S05E20 The Ride Along.txt,Chandler,Much sense?!,65
S05E20 The Ride Along.txt,Joey,"Look Chandler, it was instinct! Okay? I just went for it!",65
S05E20 The Ride Along.txt,Chandler,"So you risked your life, for a sandwich!",65
S05E20 The Ride Along.txt,Chandler,"So you didn't uh, choose Ross before me.",66
S05E20 The Ride Along.txt,Joey,No! I would never do that! You-you're like my brother!,66
S05E20 The Ride Along.txt,Chandler,Really?!,66
S05E20 The Ride Along.txt,Joey,"No, eh, oh-oi, easy, it's not a hot dog!",68
S05E20 The Ride Along.txt,Joey,How good is that?,69

S05E20 The Ride Along.txt,Ross,Wow!,78
S05E20 The Ride Along.txt,Rachel,"Now, that-that was a good thing that I told you, right?",78
S05E20 The Ride Along.txt,Ross,"Huh? Yeah! Yes, of course!",78
S05E20 The Ride Along.txt,Ross,"Right. I guess, I guess I should call Emily.",79
S05E20 The Ride Along.txt,Rachel,"Okay, no, that's not the right decision. That's not, that's not right, no Ross-Ross, come on! I mean, that woman made you miserable! Okay, Ross, do you really want to get back into that?",79
S05E20 The Ride Along.txt,Ross,"Okay, look, yesterday I would've even considered calling her back, but my ex-wife calls on the same day I have a near death experience. I mean, that-that has got to mean something!",79
S05E20 The Ride Along.txt,Rachel,"Ugh, Ross! That was not a near death experience! That was barely an experience!",79
S05E20 The Ride Along.txt,Ross,"You weren't there! Okay, maybe this is something that I-I'm supposed to seize! Y'know?",79
S05E20 The Ride Along.txt,Rachel,"Okay, y'know what? Maybe, this is not about seizing stuff. Maybe this is about escaping stuff.",79
S05E20 The Ride Along.txt,Ross,Huh.,79
S05E20 The Ride Along.txt,Ross,"That does make sense. Because I do wanna seize some opportunity, but I-I really don't wanna see or talk to her.",80
S05E20 The Ride Along.txt,Rachel,"Well, there you go!",80
S05E20 The Ride Along.txt,Ross,"Yeah. Maybe today is just, close call day.",80
S05E20 The Ride Along.txt,Ross,Oh wait-wait-wait! The message is blinking. Maybe you didn't erase it.,83
S05E20 The Ride Along.txt,Rachel,Oh?,83
S05E20 The Ride Along.txt,Rachel,Yeah.,87
S05E20 The Ride Along.txt,Ross,"Yeah, I want my money back.",87
S05E20 The Ride Along.txt,Ross,"Hey Pheebs, has Gary ever been shot at for real?",90
S05E20 The Ride Along.txt,Phoebe,"Yes. Once. Yeah, a little. He kinda did it to himself. It's not really a good story.",90
S05E20 The Ride Along.txt,Ross,"I wonder how I would react under fire, y'know? And not backfire but-but heavy fire, like I was in a war or something.",90
S05E20 The Ride Along.txt,Monica,"Man, I would be great in a war! I mean, I really, I think I would make a fantastic military leader. I mean I know I would make General way before any of you guys.",90
S05E20 The Ride Along.txt,Chandler,Before or after you were shot by your own troops?,90
S05E20 The Ride Along.txt,Ross,I know where Joey would be. He would be down in the foxhole protecting all of us.,90
S05E20 The Ride Along.txt,Chandler,"Yes, if the foxhole was lined with sandwiches.",90
S09E08 Rachels Other Sister.txt,Monica,"Hey Hon, could you help me get the plates down?",2
S09E08 Rachels Other Sister.txt,Chandler,"Yeah. Hey, here's an idea, why don't we use our wedding china today?",2
S09E08 Rachels Other Sister.txt,Monica,"No, I think we should save our china for something really special. Like if the Queen of England comes over.",2
S09E08 Rachels Other Sister.txt,Chandler,"Honey, she keeps canceling on us, take the hint.",2
S09E08 Rachels Other Sister.txt,Monica,"What if something gets broken, they're so expensive.",2
S09E08 Rachels Other Sister.txt,Chandler,What is the point of having them if we never use them?,2
S09E08 Rachels Other Sister.txt,Monica,"Ok, but if something gets broken, and then the Queen comes over..",2
S09E08 Rachels Other Sister.txt,Chandler,I will explain it to her.,2
S09E08 Rachels Other Sister.txt,Monica,"<laughs> Oh yeah, like I'm going to let you talk to the queen.",2
S09E08 Rachels Other Sister.txt,Joey,"wow, the parade is really good this year. Man those horses can crap.",2
S09E08 Rachels Other Sister.txt,Chandler,Muskogee! That's like four hours from Tulsa. Woo hoo!,2
S09E08 Rachels Other Sister.txt,Joey,Oh my God!,2
S09E08 Rachels Other Sister.txt,Chandler,Aren't you one of the stars of the popular daytime soap Days of Our Lives?,2
S09E08 Rachels Other Sister.txt,Joey,Yeah! I totally forgot I'm supposed to be there. I can't believe I forgot. I usually write stuff like this on my arm.,2
S09E08 Rachels Other Sister.txt,Chandler,What are you going to do?,2
S09E08 Rachels Other Sister.txt,Joey,"I guess I'm going to have to come up with a really good reason why I wasn't there. The producers are going to be so mad at me. They sat us all down yesterday and said ""Everyone has to be there at 6:00 AM sharp, that means you Tribbiani."" Like.. like I was some kind of idiot.",2
S09E08 Rachels Other Sister.txt,Chandler,Well you proved them wrong.,2
S09E08 Rachels Other Sister.txt,Ross,A lot of people are thankful for those.,2
S09E08 Rachels Other Sister.txt,Rachel,Who is it?,2
S09E08 Rachels Other Sister.txt,Rachel,Hide my rings.,2
S09E08 Rachels Other Sister.txt,Rachel,Oh. <opens door preparing herself and then happily says>,2

S09E08 Rachels Other Sister.txt,Rachel,I haven't seen you in like.. a year.,2
S09E08 Rachels Other Sister.txt,Amy,"Oh, I know, I know. I've just been crazed.",2
S09E08 Rachels Other Sister.txt,Rachel,Oh well yeah me too. Um.. I had a baby.,2
S09E08 Rachels Other Sister.txt,Amy,I decorated Dad's office.,2
S09E08 Rachels Other Sister.txt,Rachel,"Oh.. yeah? Well unless you pushed a desk out of your vagina, <shakes head no> not the same thing.",2
S09E08 Rachels Other Sister.txt,Amy,"Listen, um about the hair straightener, honey.. I really need one. I'm going to have dinner at my boyfriend's house.",2
S09E08 Rachels Other Sister.txt,Amy,Oh my God!,2

S09E08 Rachels Other Sister.txt,Ross,Hey Amy.,2
S09E08 Rachels Other Sister.txt,Rachel,"Oh Amy, you remember Ross.",2
S09E08 Rachels Other Sister.txt,Amy,Not really. But you are much cuter then that geeky guy she used to date.,2
S09E08 Rachels Other Sister.txt,Ross,That was me.,2
S09E08 Rachels Other Sister.txt,Amy,"No, he was this creepy guy from high school who had this huge crush on her since like the ninth grade.",2
S09E08 Rachels Other Sister.txt,Amy,"No, I'm not talking about you. <to Rachel> It was your fat",2
S09E08 Rachels Other Sister.txt,Monica,Careful. <hands Chandler a china plate> Careful. CAREFUL!,2
S09E08 Rachels Other Sister.txt,Chandler,"I'll tell you what, for the rest of our lives, I'll be careful until told otherwise. <looks at china> hey wait a minute this isn't the china we picked out..",2
S09E08 Rachels Other Sister.txt,Monica,"I know, after you left the store, I chose different ones.",2
S09E08 Rachels Other Sister.txt,Chandler,Why?,2
S09E08 Rachels Other Sister.txt,Monica,"well no offense honey, but your taste is a little feminine for me.",2
S09E08 Rachels Other Sister.txt,Chandler,"Oh suddenly, flowers are feminine?",2
S09E08 Rachels Other Sister.txt,Phoebe,"Hey, everybody. Happy Thanksgiving!",2
S09E08 Rachels Other Sister.txt,Joey,Hey happy Thanksgiving.. Pheebs! <motions her to come over>,2
S09E08 Rachels Other Sister.txt,Phoebe,"Hey, what's going on Joe?",2
S09E08 Rachels Other Sister.txt,Joey,I.. I.. I need a good lie.,2
S09E08 Rachels Other Sister.txt,Phoebe,"Oh okay. How about the whole ""man walking on the moon"" thing. You know? You. you could. You could see the strings people!",2
S09E08 Rachels Other Sister.txt,Joey,"No, no, no I need a good lie to explain why I wasn't at a work thing today.",2
S09E08 Rachels Other Sister.txt,Phoebe,"Ooh, honey. You stink at lying.",2
S09E08 Rachels Other Sister.txt,Joey,I do not.,2
S09E08 Rachels Other Sister.txt,Phoebe,"Oh really. Okay. let me ask you something. Yesterday at the coffee house, I went to the bathroom and when I came back, my muffin was gone-who took it?",2
S09E08 Rachels Other Sister.txt,Joey,"Somebody opened the door to the coffee house and a raccoon came running in, went straight for your muffin and I said ""Hey don't eat that-that's Phoebe's"" and he said.. <pause> He said.. ""Joey you stink at lying."" What am I going to do?",2
S09E08 Rachels Other Sister.txt,Phoebe,"Don't worry, don't worry. We'll come up with a good lie. I'll help you practice it.",2
S09E08 Rachels Other Sister.txt,Joey,"Oh great, that'd be great. Thank you.",2
S09E08 Rachels Other Sister.txt,Phoebe,"Sure, what.. what was the work thing?",2
S09E08 Rachels Other Sister.txt,Joey,"Uh.. <forgetting what the work thing was, rolls up his sleeve on his right arm and shows Phoebe, she looks>",2
S09E08 Rachels Other Sister.txt,Phoebe,"""Pick up grandma at the airport""?",2
S09E08 Rachels Other Sister.txt,Joey,Oh.. man..,2
S09E08 Rachels Other Sister.txt,Rachel,Amy! <pause> Yes I do.. I really do. <grabs Ross' hand for support>,2
S09E08 Rachels Other Sister.txt,Amy,"Hello? Yeah, um. Hang on one sec. <to Ross and Rachel> Can I take this upstairs?",2
S09E08 Rachels Other Sister.txt,Ross,"Sure, we don't live there but...",2
S09E08 Rachels Other Sister.txt,Amy,Seriously? Its.. its just these rooms? <moves hands around motioning 'just these rooms'> <To Ross> I thought you were a doctor.,2
S09E08 Rachels Other Sister.txt,Rachel,"Yeah, no. Ross has a PhD.",2
S09E08 Rachels Other Sister.txt,Amy,"Ew. <walks into Rachel's room, I'm guessing>",2
S09E08 Rachels Other Sister.txt,Rachel,God she is unbelievable.,2
S09E08 Rachels Other Sister.txt,Ross,"I know, I mean a PhD is just as good as an MD.",2
S09E08 Rachels Other Sister.txt,Rachel,"Oh sure Ross, yeah. If I have a heart attack in a restaurant, I want you there with your fossil brush.",2
S09E08 Rachels Other Sister.txt,Rachel,What? What happened?,2
S09E08 Rachels Other Sister.txt,Amy,"My boyfriend canceled on me. I mean.. I I finally find a real relationship. I mean, someone that I can spend this day with and then his wife comes back into town. I swear, its almost not worth dating married guys.",2
S09E08 Rachels Other Sister.txt,Ross,Don't say that.,2
S09E08 Rachels Other Sister.txt,Amy,Oh. I was so looking forward to this. It was going to be such a beautiful Thanksgiving. We were going to have sushi.,2
S09E08 Rachels Other Sister.txt,Rachel,"Oh Amy, don't cry Amy.  Um.. Ross, could I talk to you in private?",2
S09E08 Rachels Other Sister.txt,Ross,"Sure, you want to go upstairs?",2
S09E08 Rachels Other Sister.txt,Rachel,Um look I was thinking.. If its ok with Monica I would like to invite Amy to Thanksgiving.,2
S09E08 Rachels Other Sister.txt,Ross,"You know, I think thats a great idea. It'll be like the pilgrims bringing the Indians syphilis.",2
S09E08 Rachels Other Sister.txt,Rachel,"Look I know she's a little tough to take. She has no where else to go, and she's my sister. Alright, she's Emma's aunt. And I would like them to bond.",2
S09E08 Rachels Other Sister.txt,Ross,"Ok, fine, but I don't want them bonding to much. I don't want her telling Emma she needs a nose job.",2
S09E08 Rachels Other Sister.txt,Rachel,"Ross, you know what? She may need one..We're just going to have to make our peace with that!",2
S09E08 Rachels Other Sister.txt,Rachel,"Hey you guys, this is my sister Amy.  This is Chandler, Joey, Phoebe and you know Mon.",2
S09E08 Rachels Other Sister.txt,Everyone,Hi.,2
S09E08 Rachels Other Sister.txt,Amy,Oh my god. You're on Days of Our Lives.,2
S09E08 Rachels Other Sister.txt,Amy,wow. They must put a lot of makeup on you.,2
S09E08 Rachels Other Sister.txt,Amy,Oh. That's a funny noise.,2
S09E08 Rachels Other Sister.txt,Joey,"Pheebs, I still need some help here",2
S09E08 Rachels Other Sister.txt,Phoebe,"Oh right, ok um. Ok so its not just the lie you tell. but its the way you tell it. . For example if you look down at the ground when you're talking, people know you're lying.",2
S09E08 Rachels Other Sister.txt,Joey,Oh.. I don't know why this is so hard for me. you know.. I mean lying is basically just acting and I am a terrfic actor.,2
S09E08 Rachels Other Sister.txt,Rachel,Oh we just put her down for a nap.,2
S09E08 Rachels Other Sister.txt,Amy,Oh I was just thinking. You know what would be incredible? If you guys died.,2
S09E08 Rachels Other Sister.txt,Amy,"no, no, then I would get the baby. I mean you know it would be just like a movie. Like at first I wouldn't know what to do with her, then I would rise to the occasion and and then I would get a makeover and then I'd get married.",2
S09E08 Rachels Other Sister.txt,Phoebe,Thats a great movie. <she claps>,2
S09E08 Rachels Other Sister.txt,Ross,Emma.,3
S09E08 Rachels Other Sister.txt,Phoebe,PHOE-BE.,3
S09E08 Rachels Other Sister.txt,Rachel,"Honey, I don't know how to tell you this, but um, if something were to happen to Ross or to myself <Ross and Rachel knock on wood> um you wouldn't get the baby.",3
S09E08 Rachels Other Sister.txt,Amy,Well who would?,3
S09E08 Rachels Other Sister.txt,Ross,"Well we haven't offically asked them yet, but we would want Monica and Chandler.",3
S09E08 Rachels Other Sister.txt,Chandler,I can't believe you'd want us to raise Emma.,3
S09E08 Rachels Other Sister.txt,Monica,"yeah oh my god, I'm so moved.",3
S09E08 Rachels Other Sister.txt,Amy,"I don't believe this, hold on a second. You guys die and I don't get your baby?",3
S09E08 Rachels Other Sister.txt,Rachel,"See look Amy, we're a lot closer to Monica and Chandler. We see them every day. And truthfully honey, you don't seem very connected to the baby.",3
S09E08 Rachels Other Sister.txt,Amy,Connected? I mean.. to what? She's.. she's  a lump.,3
S09E08 Rachels Other Sister.txt,Chandler,"You know, guys I got to say. This means so much to me. That you would trust me with your child. I mean, we all know that Monica and I have been trying to have a baby of our own. You know I've had my doubts about my skills as a father, but that you two.. that you two.... <starts to cry>",3
S09E08 Rachels Other Sister.txt,Amy,<points to Chandler> This guy? Seriously?,3
S09E08 Rachels Other Sister.txt,Monica,Okay! It's time for dinner. Everyone we're using our fancy china.. um and its very expensive so please be careful.,3
S09E08 Rachels Other Sister.txt,Monica,"Okay, just to be clear comedy with the plates will not be well recieved. <pinches Ross' arm>",3
S09E08 Rachels Other Sister.txt,Joey,Hey! How come my plate's less fancy then everyone else's? Do you not trust me with a fancy plate?,3
S09E08 Rachels Other Sister.txt,Monica,"No, honey, its. thats a special plate.  See its a game, whoever gets that plate wins.",3
S09E08 Rachels Other Sister.txt,Joey,I can't believe I won.,3
S09E08 Rachels Other Sister.txt,Amy,Its such a slap in the face. I'm your sister and you would give your baby to these strangers over me.,3
S09E08 Rachels Other Sister.txt,Rachel,Monica is Ross' sister.,3
S09E08 Rachels Other Sister.txt,Amy,"No, Ross' sister was really fat.",3
S09E08 Rachels Other Sister.txt,Monica,That was me.,3
S09E08 Rachels Other Sister.txt,Amy,"No, she was this really dorky girl in high school that used to follow Rachel around like a puppy dog.",3
S09E08 Rachels Other Sister.txt,Rachel,Hey. Amy. You've got to stop doing that.,3
S09E08 Rachels Other Sister.txt,Monica,"Now see, this way you protect the plate.. and lets face it you have fun.",3
S09E08 Rachels Other Sister.txt,Amy,"Okay, how about this, you guys die and the crazy plate lady dies, then do I get the baby?",3
S09E08 Rachels Other Sister.txt,Chandler,"No, if crazy plate lad.. <sees Monica frustrated at this comment> If Monica dies then I would get Emma, Right?",3
S09E08 Rachels Other Sister.txt,Rachel,Well actually...,3
S09E08 Rachels Other Sister.txt,Chandler,Actually what?,3
S09E08 Rachels Other Sister.txt,Ross,"well.. its just. its just in that case, then um. Emma would go to my parents.",3
S09E08 Rachels Other Sister.txt,Chandler,What?,3
S09E08 Rachels Other Sister.txt,Amy,"Hurts, doesn't it?",3
S09E08 Rachels Other Sister.txt,Chandler,"So if Monica's not around, then I'm not good enough to raise Emma?",3
S09E08 Rachels Other Sister.txt,Joey,Yeah he's lying. He looked down.,3
S09E08 Rachels Other Sister.txt,Chandler,Well what is wrong with me? Am I .. am I incomptent? Because I managed to survive whatever it is that killed the three of you!,3
S09E08 Rachels Other Sister.txt,Rachel,"Honey, you're taking this the wrong way. We think you're going to be a wonderful parent. It's just.. you're more the fun parent.",3
S09E08 Rachels Other Sister.txt,Ross,Yeah and we'd want to make sure Emma has someone like Monica who is more uh. uh discliplinarin.. someone who can be firm and strict.,3
S09E08 Rachels Other Sister.txt,Monica,"Thats not how you see me, is it?",3
S09E08 Rachels Other Sister.txt,Chandler,"Look, I may not know a lot about babies, but do you really think I'm not capable?",3
S09E08 Rachels Other Sister.txt,Ross,"No, you both are equally capable. Its just.. you're strongest when.. when you're together.",3
S09E08 Rachels Other Sister.txt,Chandler,Ok. So if we both had Emma and I die <knocks on table>  she'd have to give her up.,3
S09E08 Rachels Other Sister.txt,Ross,"Sure, Monica would have to give her up.",3
S09E08 Rachels Other Sister.txt,Joey,"I lie better then that, right?",3
S09E08 Rachels Other Sister.txt,Chandler,"So.. let me get this straight. So my two friends die, I get Emma. Then my wife dies, then Emma the one tiny ray of hope left in my life gets taken away from me?",3
S09E08 Rachels Other Sister.txt,Phoebe,There's your movie! <claps>,3
S09E08 Rachels Other Sister.txt,Monica,Hey. There you are. You disappeared after dinner.,3
S09E08 Rachels Other Sister.txt,Chandler,Oh? Did somebody miss me? Is there a child to raise poorly?,3
S09E08 Rachels Other Sister.txt,Monica,Ross and Rachel don't know what they're talking about. I mean its not like their so responsible. Emma is a product of a bottle of Merlot and a five year old condom.,3
S09E08 Rachels Other Sister.txt,Chandler,"Yeah but they're right. I mean, I'm not a strong father figure and I never will be.",3
S09E08 Rachels Other Sister.txt,Monica,No you learn these things. You grow into it.,3
S09E08 Rachels Other Sister.txt,Chandler,"Yeah, but its not who I am. Everything they said was exaclty why I was worried about having a kid. And its true. And look everybody knows it.",3
S09E08 Rachels Other Sister.txt,Monica,I don't know it! I want to have a kid with you because I think you're going to be an amazing dad... at the fun parts and the hard parts.,3
S09E08 Rachels Other Sister.txt,Chandler,"Oh yeah, well can you picture me saying ""Go to your room! You're grounded""?",3
S09E08 Rachels Other Sister.txt,Monica,"Can you hear me say ""You're grounded""?",3
S09E08 Rachels Other Sister.txt,Chandler,You said that to me last week.,3
S09E08 Rachels Other Sister.txt,Monica,How hard is it? No shoes on the furniture.,3
S09E08 Rachels Other Sister.txt,Phoebe,It's ok. I thought of the perfect lie for you. It's easy to remember and doesn't invite a lot of questions. You weren't at the parade because you had a family emergency.,3
S09E08 Rachels Other Sister.txt,Joey,"Oh, I like that, yeah. Wasn't at the parade because I had a family emergency.",3
S09E08 Rachels Other Sister.txt,Phoebe,"Ooh, what happened?",3
S09E08 Rachels Other Sister.txt,Phoebe,No! Nothing with a raccoon.,3
S09E08 Rachels Other Sister.txt,Joey,"Arg... Alright, I'll take care of it. <throws hands out in the air>",3
S09E08 Rachels Other Sister.txt,Monica,Oh wait.. What are you doing?,3
S09E08 Rachels Other Sister.txt,Joey,Setting the table.,3
S09E08 Rachels Other Sister.txt,Phoebe,Yeah we thought it would be nice to use the fancy china for dessert too.,3
S09E08 Rachels Other Sister.txt,Monica,Oh how nice. Maybe later we can all go blow our noses on my wedding dress.,3
S09E08 Rachels Other Sister.txt,Ross,"Hey dude, you okay? Sorry about before.",3
S09E08 Rachels Other Sister.txt,Chandler,"Oh no thats okay, you're totally right. I don't know anything about disciplining a child. But it did hurt my feelings and I want you to know that when I die, you don't get Joey.",3
S09E08 Rachels Other Sister.txt,Rachel,UCHH! <much louder and longer then Amy's>,3
S09E08 Rachels Other Sister.txt,Amy,You know.. this.. this is classic Rachel.,3
S09E08 Rachels Other Sister.txt,Rachel,Yeah.. yeah right.. Remember in high school when I died and didn't give you my baby?,3
S09E08 Rachels Other Sister.txt,Amy,"This might be my one chance to have a baby Rachel. I mean, you know that I have been so busy focusing on my carrer.",3
S09E08 Rachels Other Sister.txt,Rachel,What? What carrer?,3
S09E08 Rachels Other Sister.txt,Amy,Um.. I'm a decorator.,3
S09E08 Rachels Other Sister.txt,Rachel,Ok. You decorate dad's office and so now you're a decorator. Okay! I went to the zoo yesterday and now I'm a koala bear.,3
S09E08 Rachels Other Sister.txt,Amy,Why can't you ever be supportive?,3
S09E08 Rachels Other Sister.txt,Rachel,Sup.. You want to talk supportive? You didn't even come and visit me when I was in the hospital having the baby.,3
S09E08 Rachels Other Sister.txt,Amy,Oh. Yeah. Well.. You didn't come see me when I was in the hospital when I was getting my lips done.,3
S09E08 Rachels Other Sister.txt,Rachel,I did the first time! Oh. Oh.. <gets up and walks into the kitchen> And you know what. You want to know why I'm not giving Emily to you.,3
S09E08 Rachels Other Sister.txt,Ross,Emma.,3
S09E08 Rachels Other Sister.txt,Amy,How hard could it be? You do it.,3
S09E08 Rachels Other Sister.txt,Joey,ooh oooh..,3
S09E08 Rachels Other Sister.txt,Amy,Do you want to know why you don't want  me to have the baby?,3
S09E08 Rachels Other Sister.txt,Rachel,uh huh.,3
S09E08 Rachels Other Sister.txt,Amy,Because you don't want me to be happy. You.. you have always been jealous of me.,3
S09E08 Rachels Other Sister.txt,Rachel,"Jealous of what? Of your lack of responsiblity? You, your immaturity? Your total disregard of other people's feelings?",3
S09E08 Rachels Other Sister.txt,Amy,"Uh.. To name a few.  You know.. You know.. You've just always been like this. You just have to have everything. And I couldn't have anything. Like in junior high, when you stole Timmy from me. I mean, do you even realize how much that hurt me?",3
S09E08 Rachels Other Sister.txt,Rachel,Timmy was my boyfriend and you made out with him!,3
S09E08 Rachels Other Sister.txt,Amy,"Oh come on, that was 20 years ago. Get over it.",3
S09E08 Rachels Other Sister.txt,Rachel,"I cannot, I cannot believe that I invited you here today.",3
S09E08 Rachels Other Sister.txt,Amy,"Yeah, well you know what I cannot believe. That my so-called sister, gets a 30% discount from Ralph Lauren and I still have to pay retail.",3
S09E08 Rachels Other Sister.txt,Rachel,ah ha ha. ah ha ha. <evil meancing laughter> It's forty five.,3
S09E08 Rachels Other Sister.txt,Amy,"You bitch. You just think you're so perfect. With your new baby and your, your small apartment. <directs this to Ross who in turns throws the towel in his hand down on the table> Well let me tell you something. Your baby isn't even that cute.",3
S09E08 Rachels Other Sister.txt,Rachel,You take that back.,3
S09E08 Rachels Other Sister.txt,Amy,No.,3
S09E08 Rachels Other Sister.txt,Rachel,Take it back!,3
S09E08 Rachels Other Sister.txt,Amy,No! What are you going to do? Make me?,3
S09E08 Rachels Other Sister.txt,Rachel,"Heey man, I work out.",3
S09E08 Rachels Other Sister.txt,Amy,So do I.,3
S09E08 Rachels Other Sister.txt,Rachel,I do pilates.,3
S09E08 Rachels Other Sister.txt,Amy,I do yoga.,3
S09E08 Rachels Other Sister.txt,Rachel,Bring it on!,3
S09E08 Rachels Other Sister.txt,Monica,Put the plates in the boxes!! Put the plates in the boxes!,3
S09E08 Rachels Other Sister.txt,Rachel,Did you just push me?,3
S09E08 Rachels Other Sister.txt,Amy,"Uh, yeah I think I did.",3
S09E08 Rachels Other Sister.txt,Rachel,Alright. Thats it! <Pushes Amy back>,3
S09E08 Rachels Other Sister.txt,Phoebe,Oh my god! Shouldn't we stop this?,3
S09E08 Rachels Other Sister.txt,Joey,What? Are you out of your mind? Lets throw some jello on them.,3
S09E08 Rachels Other Sister.txt,Rachel,Ew! Gross.,3
S09E08 Rachels Other Sister.txt,Chandler,"Alright! That is it. This is our apartment and you can not behave this way. Now if you can't act your age then you shouldn't be here at all. Now those plates may not be as nice as the pretty pink ones I picked out, but they're very important to Monica. I want you to apologize to her right now.",3
S09E08 Rachels Other Sister.txt,Amy,I'm sorry.,3

S01E14 The Candy Hearts.txt,Chandler,"Oh, uh, listen, about tonight...",5
S01E14 The Candy Hearts.txt,Joey,"No, no, no, don't you dare bail on me. The only reason she's goin' out with me is because I said I could bring a friend for her friend.",5

S01E14 The Candy Hearts.txt,Monica,Which one was Pete Carney?,16
S01E14 The Candy Hearts.txt,Rachel,How did we end up with these jerks? We're good people!,18
S01E14 The Candy Hearts.txt,Monica,I don't know. Maybe we're some kinda magnets.,18
S01E14 The Candy Hearts.txt,Phoebe,I know I am. That's why I can't wear a digital watch.,18
S01E14 The Candy Hearts.txt,Monica,"There's more beer, right?",18

S01E14 The Candy Hearts.txt,Chandler,That's OK.,20
S01E14 The Candy Hearts.txt,Janice,"Oh, are you sure? Really? Because you know, you could make little puppets out of them, and you could use them in your theater of cruelty.",20
S01E14 The Candy Hearts.txt,Joey,"Uh, can I talk to you for a second, over there?",23
S01E14 The Candy Hearts.txt,Joey,"Uh, we might be leaving now.",24

S01E14 The Candy Hearts.txt,Chandler,"Oh, what a crappy night!",26
S01E14 The Candy Hearts.txt,Janice,"Although, I have enjoyed the fact that, uh your shirt's been stickin' outta your zipper ever since you came back from the bathroom.",26
S01E14 The Candy Hearts.txt,Janice,"So, do we have the best friends or what?",27
S01E14 The Candy Hearts.txt,Chandler,Joey's not a friend. He's...a stupid man who left us his credit card. Another drink? Some dessert? A big screen TV?,27
S01E14 The Candy Hearts.txt,Janice,I will go for that drink.,27
S01E14 The Candy Hearts.txt,Janice,Each.,28
S01E14 The Candy Hearts.txt,Janice,Happy Valentine's Day!,30

S01E14 The Candy Hearts.txt,Rachel,"Oh, Joey, look who it is.",34
S01E14 The Candy Hearts.txt,Chandler,"Oh, good, Joey's home now.",35
S01E14 The Candy Hearts.txt,Janice,This is so fun. This is like a reunion in the hall.,35
S01E14 The Candy Hearts.txt,Ross,"I'm just sayin' if dogs do experience jet lag, then, because of the whole um, seven dog years to one human year thing, then, when a dog flies from New York to Los Angeles, he doesn't just lose three hours, he loses like a week and a half.",39
S01E14 The Candy Hearts.txt,Kristin,That's funny. Who are they?,40
S01E14 The Candy Hearts.txt,Ross,"The blond woman is my ex-wife, and the woman touching her is her... close, personal friend.",40
S01E14 The Candy Hearts.txt,Kristin,You mean they're lovers.,40
S01E14 The Candy Hearts.txt,Ross,If you wanna put a label on it.,40
S01E14 The Candy Hearts.txt,Kristin,"Wow, uh, anything else I should know?",40
S01E14 The Candy Hearts.txt,Ross,"Nope, nope, that's it.",40
S01E14 The Candy Hearts.txt,Phoebe,"Ok, so now we need, um sage branches and the sacramental wine.",43
S01E14 The Candy Hearts.txt,Monica,"All I have is, is oregano and a Fresca.",43
S01E14 The Candy Hearts.txt,Rachel,"Ok, Pheebs, you know what, if we had that, we wouldn't be doing the ritual in the first place.",44
S01E14 The Candy Hearts.txt,Monica,Can we just start throwing things in?,44
S01E14 The Candy Hearts.txt,Phoebe,"Ok, and I have the, uh receipt for my dinner with Nokululu Oon Ah Ah.",46
S01E14 The Candy Hearts.txt,Monica,"Look, here's a picture of Scotty Jared naked.",46
S01E14 The Candy Hearts.txt,Monica,No.,47
S01E14 The Candy Hearts.txt,Rachel,And here we have the last of Paulo's grappa.,47
S01E14 The Candy Hearts.txt,Monica,"Hey, Rachel, isn't that stuff almost pure...",47
S01E14 The Candy Hearts.txt,Chandler,How can I dump this woman on Valentine's day?,49
S01E14 The Candy Hearts.txt,Joey,I don't know. You dumped her on New Year's.,49
S01E14 The Candy Hearts.txt,Chandler,"Oh, man. In my next life, I'm coming back as a toilet brush.",49
S01E14 The Candy Hearts.txt,Janice,"Hello, funny Valentine.",50
S01E14 The Candy Hearts.txt,Chandler,"Hi, Just Janice.",50
S01E14 The Candy Hearts.txt,Janice,"Hello, Joey, our little matchmaker. I could just kiss you all over, and I'm gonna!",50
S01E14 The Candy Hearts.txt,Ross,"So, um, what do you do for a living?",53
S01E14 The Candy Hearts.txt,Carol,Oh no. I thought you said they could shoot the spot without you.,54
S01E14 The Candy Hearts.txt,Ross,"Now that is funny. Hey, do you think...would it be too weird if I invited Carol over to join us? 'Cause she's, she's alone now, and pregnant, and, and sad.",55
S01E14 The Candy Hearts.txt,Ross,Are you sure? Great. Carol? Wanna come over and join us?,56
S01E14 The Candy Hearts.txt,Carol,"Oh, no no no. I'm fine. I'm fine.",56
S01E14 The Candy Hearts.txt,Monica,"You know, it's a really funny story how this happened.",58
S01E14 The Candy Hearts.txt,Rachel,Really?,58
S01E14 The Candy Hearts.txt,Janice,I brought you something.,59
S01E14 The Candy Hearts.txt,Janice,I had them made special.,60
S01E14 The Candy Hearts.txt,Chandler,"Ok, Janice. Janice. Hey, Janice. Look, there's no way for me to tell you this. At least there's no new way for me to tell you this. I just don't things are gonna work out.",60
S01E14 The Candy Hearts.txt,Janice,That's fine.,60
S01E14 The Candy Hearts.txt,Janice,Mmm-hmm. Because I know that this isn't the end.,61
S01E14 The Candy Hearts.txt,Chandler,"Oh no, you see, actually it is.",61
S01E14 The Candy Hearts.txt,Janice,"No, it isn't, because you won't let that happen. Don't you know it yet? You love me, Chandler Bing.",61
S01E14 The Candy Hearts.txt,Chandler,"Oh, no I don't.",61
S01E14 The Candy Hearts.txt,Janice,Well then ask yourself this. Why do you think we keep ending up together? New Year's? Who invited who? Valentine's? Who asked who into whose bed?,61
S01E14 The Candy Hearts.txt,Chandler,"I did, but...",61
S01E14 The Candy Hearts.txt,Janice,"You seek me out. Something deep in your soul calls out to me like a foghorn. Janice, Janice. You want me. You need me. You can't live without me. And you know it. You just don't know you know it. See ya.",61
S01E14 The Candy Hearts.txt,Chandler,Call me!,62
S01E14 The Candy Hearts.txt,Carol,It's not true. I never called your mother a wolverine.,63
S01E14 The Candy Hearts.txt,Carol,"Uh, I don't think she's in the bathroom. Her coat is gone.",64
S01E14 The Candy Hearts.txt,Ross,Well maybe it's cold in there. Or maybe I screwed up the first date I had in 9 years.,64
S01E14 The Candy Hearts.txt,Carol,That could be it.,64
S01E14 The Candy Hearts.txt,Carol,"Mushroom. Smile. They won't all be like this. Some women might even stay through dinner. Sorry, that's not funny",65
S01E14 The Candy Hearts.txt,Ross,"No, it's just...you know the whole ""getting on with your life"" thing. Well, do I have to? I mean, I'm sitting here with this cute woman, and, and, and she's perfectly nice, and, but that there's, that's it. And um, and then I'm here talkin' to you, and, and it's easy, and it's fun, and, and I don't, I don't have to...You know, here's a wacky thought. Um, what's say you and I give it another shot? No no no, I know what you're gonna say, you're a lesbian. But what do you say we just put that aside for now you know? Let's just stick a pin in it, ok? Because, we're great together, you know. You can't deny it. Besides, you're carrying my baby. I mean, how perfect is that? But see, you know, you keep sayin' that, but there's somethin' right here. I love you.",65
S01E14 The Candy Hearts.txt,Carol,"Oh, I love you too. But...",66
S01E14 The Candy Hearts.txt,Ross,"No but, no but.",66
S01E14 The Candy Hearts.txt,Carol,"You know that thing you put over here with the pin in it? It's time to take the pin out. You'll find someone, I know you will. The right woman is just waiting for you.",66
S01E14 The Candy Hearts.txt,Ross,"That's easy for you to say, you found one already.",66
S01E14 The Candy Hearts.txt,Carol,All you need is a woman who likes men and you'll be set.,66
S01E14 The Candy Hearts.txt,Carol,Not her.,67
S01E14 The Candy Hearts.txt,Rachel,"So, um, will you bring the truck?",68
S01E14 The Candy Hearts.txt,Rachel,"Oh, my god.",68
S01E14 The Candy Hearts.txt,Phoebe,"See, there you go, the cleansing works!",68
S01E14 The Candy Hearts.txt,Monica,They're nice guys.,68
S01E14 The Candy Hearts.txt,Rachel,"Oh, they're firemen guys.",68
S02E11 The Lesbian Wedding.txt,Ross,"Ok. Here's his diaper bag, and his uh, Mr. Winky, and uh...oh, him. Hi!",2
S02E11 The Lesbian Wedding.txt,Carol,So how did everything go?,2
S02E11 The Lesbian Wedding.txt,Ross,"Oh, great. Great. There was a projectile, uh, throwing up incident, but he started it.",2
S02E11 The Lesbian Wedding.txt,Carol,"Well, we've gotta go.",2
S02E11 The Lesbian Wedding.txt,Ross,Ok.,2
S02E11 The Lesbian Wedding.txt,Carol,"Oh, right. Um, I've got some news. It's about us.",3
S02E11 The Lesbian Wedding.txt,Ross,"Oh, you and me?",3
S02E11 The Lesbian Wedding.txt,Carol,"Uh, no, Susan and me.",3
S02E11 The Lesbian Wedding.txt,Susan,The other us.,3
S02E11 The Lesbian Wedding.txt,Ross,Ok.,3
S02E11 The Lesbian Wedding.txt,Carol,"We're uh, we're getting married.",3
S02E11 The Lesbian Wedding.txt,Ross,"As in, ""I now pronounce you wife and wife"" married?",3
S02E11 The Lesbian Wedding.txt,Carol,"Anyway, we'd like you to come, but we totally understand if you don't want to.",3
S02E11 The Lesbian Wedding.txt,Ross,Why wouldn't I want to come? I had fun at the first wedding.,3
S02E11 The Lesbian Wedding.txt,Carol,Look I just thought that...,3
S02E11 The Lesbian Wedding.txt,Ross,"No no no, I mean, hey, why shouldn't I be happy for you? What would it say about me if I couldn't revel in your joy? I'm revelling baby, believe me!",3
S02E11 The Lesbian Wedding.txt,Susan,Is your finger caught in that chair?,3
S02E11 The Lesbian Wedding.txt,Ross,Mmm hmmm.,3
S02E11 The Lesbian Wedding.txt,Carol,Want us to go?,3
S02E11 The Lesbian Wedding.txt,Ross,Uh-huh.,3
S02E11 The Lesbian Wedding.txt,Ross,This is so cool. You're actually gonna be on television.,4
S02E11 The Lesbian Wedding.txt,Joey,"It really hit me last night. I'm gonna be on Days of our Lives. And then I started thinkin' about all of u, and how these are the days of our lives..",4
S02E11 The Lesbian Wedding.txt,Monica,"Yes! Carol and Susan's caterer had a mountain bike accident this weekend, and she's in a full body cast.",4
S02E11 The Lesbian Wedding.txt,Monica,"They want me to do it, which is really cool, seeing as I've never catered before, and I really need the money, and this isn't a problem for you, is it?",4
S02E11 The Lesbian Wedding.txt,Ross,Would it matter?,4
S02E11 The Lesbian Wedding.txt,Joey,Are you really not going?,5
S02E11 The Lesbian Wedding.txt,Ross,"I am really not going. I don't get it. They already live together, why do they need to get married?",5
S02E11 The Lesbian Wedding.txt,Monica,"They love each other, and they wanna celebrate that love with the people that are close with them.",5
S02E11 The Lesbian Wedding.txt,Ross,If you wanna call that a reason.,5
S02E11 The Lesbian Wedding.txt,Monica,"Ross, I thought you were over this.",6
S02E11 The Lesbian Wedding.txt,Ross,"Look, that has nothing to do with this, ok? She's my ex-wife. If she were marrying a guy, none of you'd expect me to be there.",6
S02E11 The Lesbian Wedding.txt,Joey,"Hey, if she were marrying a guy, she'd be like the worst lesbian ever.",6
S02E11 The Lesbian Wedding.txt,Joey,"No, I'm on right after this guy shoots himself.",7
S02E11 The Lesbian Wedding.txt,Chandler,"Whoa, she's pretty.",7
S02E11 The Lesbian Wedding.txt,Joey,"Yeah, and she's really nice too. She taught me all about how to work the cameras, and smell-the-fart acting.",7
S02E11 The Lesbian Wedding.txt,Rachel,"I'm sorry, what?",7
S02E11 The Lesbian Wedding.txt,Monica,What?,7
S02E11 The Lesbian Wedding.txt,Joey,"It's like, you got so many lines to learn so fast, that sometimes you need a minute to remember your next one. So while you're thinkin' of it, you take this big pause where you look all intense, you know, like this.",7
S02E11 The Lesbian Wedding.txt,Chandler,"Oh, ok.",7
S02E11 The Lesbian Wedding.txt,Joey,I'm afraid the situation is much worse than we expected. Your sister is suffering from a..subcranial hematoma. Perhaps we can discuss this over coffee.,8
S02E11 The Lesbian Wedding.txt,Chandler,Nice!,8
S02E11 The Lesbian Wedding.txt,Rachel,That's great!,8
S02E11 The Lesbian Wedding.txt,Ross,Excellent!,8
S02E11 The Lesbian Wedding.txt,Chandler,For a minute there I thought you were actually tryin' to smell something.,8
S02E11 The Lesbian Wedding.txt,Ross,That is so good! Do it again!,9
S02E11 The Lesbian Wedding.txt,Joey,"All right, all right. ""Damnit Braverman, it's right there on the chart!""",9
S02E11 The Lesbian Wedding.txt,Chandler,"That's great. All right, I gotta get to work, I got a big dinosaur bone to inspect.",9
S02E11 The Lesbian Wedding.txt,Ross,"No no, that's me.",9
S02E11 The Lesbian Wedding.txt,Chandler,"Oh, yeah.",9
S02E11 The Lesbian Wedding.txt,Ross,"Oh, hello.",9
S02E11 The Lesbian Wedding.txt,Phoebe,"Oh, thanks. I couldn't uh...",9
S02E11 The Lesbian Wedding.txt,Ross,Is everything ok?,9
S02E11 The Lesbian Wedding.txt,Phoebe,"Um, no, huh-uh. One of my clients died on the massage table today.",9
S02E11 The Lesbian Wedding.txt,Ross,Oh my god.,9
S02E11 The Lesbian Wedding.txt,Chandler,That's a little more relaxed than you want them to get.,9
S02E11 The Lesbian Wedding.txt,Phoebe,"Yeah, um, she was 82 years old. Her name was um, Mrs. Adelman.",9
S02E11 The Lesbian Wedding.txt,Monica,"Oh, honey.",9
S02E11 The Lesbian Wedding.txt,Phoebe,"Yeah, it's just so strange. I mean, she probably woke up today and thought, ""ok, I'll have some breakfast, and then I'll take a little walk, and then I'll have my massage."" Little did she know God was thinking, ""Ok, but that's it."" Oh, but the weirdest thing was, ok, I was cleansing her aura when she died, and when the spirit left her body, I don't think it went very far.",9
S02E11 The Lesbian Wedding.txt,Rachel,What do you mean?,9
S02E11 The Lesbian Wedding.txt,Phoebe,I think it went into me.,9
S02E11 The Lesbian Wedding.txt,Monica,"God, this is so hard. I can't decide between lamb or duck.",11
S02E11 The Lesbian Wedding.txt,Chandler,"Well, of course, lambs are scarier. Otherwise the movie would've been called Silence of the Ducks.",11
S02E11 The Lesbian Wedding.txt,Rachel,"Ok, who ordered what?",11
S02E11 The Lesbian Wedding.txt,Ross,"Oh, I believe I had the half-drunk cappuccino with the lipstick on the rim.",11
S02E11 The Lesbian Wedding.txt,Chandler,"Yes, and this with the cigarette butt in it, is that decaf?",11
S02E11 The Lesbian Wedding.txt,Rachel,Oh god.,11
S02E11 The Lesbian Wedding.txt,Joey,I can't believe you're so uptight about your mom comin'.,11
S02E11 The Lesbian Wedding.txt,Rachel,"I know, but it's just it's the first time, and I just don't want her to think that because I didn't marry Barry, that my life is total crap, you know?",11
S02E11 The Lesbian Wedding.txt,Joey,"Uh, Pheebs, how long do you think this lady'll be with us?",12
S02E11 The Lesbian Wedding.txt,Rachel,Mom!,14
S02E11 The Lesbian Wedding.txt,Rachel,Pretty much.,14
S02E11 The Lesbian Wedding.txt,Rachel,"This is Joey, and Phoebe, and this is Chandler, and you remember Ross.",14
S02E11 The Lesbian Wedding.txt,Rachel,Oh Mom!,15

S02E11 The Lesbian Wedding.txt,Joey,"Hey, look who's up.",18
S02E11 The Lesbian Wedding.txt,Rachel,"I just can't believe this is happening. I mean, when I was little, everybody's parents were getting divorced. I just figured as a grownup I wouldn't have to worry about this.",18
S02E11 The Lesbian Wedding.txt,Monica,"Is there any chance that you can look at this as flattering? I mean, she's doing it because she wants to be more like you.",18

S02E11 The Lesbian Wedding.txt,Ross,It's ok. I'm sorry.,25
S02E11 The Lesbian Wedding.txt,Carol,"And then Susan and I got in this big fight because I said maybe we should call off the wedding, and she said we weren't doing it for them, we were doing it for us, and if I couldn't see that, then maybe we should call off the wedding. I don't know what to do.",25
S02E11 The Lesbian Wedding.txt,Ross,"I uh can't believe I'm gonna say this, but I think Susan's right.",25
S02E11 The Lesbian Wedding.txt,Carol,You do?,25
S02E11 The Lesbian Wedding.txt,Ross,"Look, do you love her? And you don't have to be too emphatic about this.",25
S02E11 The Lesbian Wedding.txt,Carol,Of course I do.,25
S02E11 The Lesbian Wedding.txt,Ross,"Well then that's it. And if George and Adelaide can't accept that, then the hell with them. Look, if my parents didn't want me to marry you, no way that would have stopped me. Look, this is your wedding. Do it.",25

S04E02 The Cat.txt,Monica,"Back then, I thought that I would never, ever get the chance to go out with a Chip Matthews, and now he’s-he’s called me up and asked me out. And the fat girl inside of me really wants to go. I-I owe her this. I never let her eat.",27

S03E14 Phoebes Ex-Partner.txt,Monica,Uh-huh.,60
S03E14 Phoebes Ex-Partner.txt,Chandler,"Oh God, it freaked me out. Okay, I know it shouldn’t have, but it did.

I’m the smallest person in the world.",60
S03E14 Phoebes Ex-Partner.txt,Chandler,It came up.,63

S03E14 Phoebes Ex-Partner.txt,Ross,Come on! Forty-five minutes! Forty-five minutes the man talked about strappy backed dresses.,66
S03E14 Phoebes Ex-Partner.txt,Rachel,"Well okay, how about four hours in a freezing museum auditorium listening to Professor Pitstains and he’s ‘Hey everybody! Remember that thing that’s been dead for a gazillion years. Well there’s this little bone we didn’t know it had!’",66
S03E14 Phoebes Ex-Partner.txt,Ross,"First of all it’s Professor Pittain! And second of all, that little bone, proved that, that particular dinosaur had wings, but didn’t fly.",66

S03E14 Phoebes Ex-Partner.txt,Rachel,"Oh, that is so...",66
S03E14 Phoebes Ex-Partner.txt,Rachel,"Y'know if what I do is so lame, then why did you insist on coming with me this morning? Huh? Was it so I just wouldn’t go with Mark?",67
S03E14 Phoebes Ex-Partner.txt,Ross,"No. I... I wanted to be with you. I don’t know, I feel like lately, I feel like you’re slipping away from me, y'know. With this new job, and all these new people, and you’ve got this whole other life going on. I-I-I know it’s dumb, but I hate that I’m not a part of it.",67
S03E14 Phoebes Ex-Partner.txt,Ross,That’s a little clearer.,68
S03E14 Phoebes Ex-Partner.txt,Rachel,"Honey see, it doesn’t mean that I don’t love you. Because I do. I love you, I love you so much. But my work it’s-it’s for me y'know, I’m out there, on my own, and I’m doing it and it’s scary but I love it, because it’s mine. I, but, I mean is that okay?",68
S03E14 Phoebes Ex-Partner.txt,Ginger,Your thinking about my leg aren’t you?,70
S03E14 Phoebes Ex-Partner.txt,Chandler,"No. No. Actually I forgot, what is the deal with that again?",70
S03E14 Phoebes Ex-Partner.txt,Ginger,It’s okay if it bothers you. Really. I mean the only thing I need to know is: ‘How much it bothers you?’ because I don’t like wasting my time. Am I wasting my time?,70
S03E14 Phoebes Ex-Partner.txt,Chandler,No. No. I don’t think so.,70
S03E14 Phoebes Ex-Partner.txt,Ginger,"Okay. It’s just like anything else, you just have to get used to it.",70

S03E14 Phoebes Ex-Partner.txt,Phoebe,"No, look, I told you that I didn’t want you to try and sell it, and you just, you big fat did it anyway. God, y'know what, I think five years ago I probably would’ve done anything to play with you but, I can do it by myself. And if I can’t trust you then just forget it.",76
S03E14 Phoebes Ex-Partner.txt,Leslie,"No, no, I don’t want to forget it.",76
S03E14 Phoebes Ex-Partner.txt,Phoebe,"Okay y'know what you have to choose. All right, if-if the most important thing on the planet to you is this cat poopy thing then, okay you can have Smelly Cat, but we won’t be partners. So what’s it gonna be?",76

S05E22 Joeys Big Break.txt,Chandler,"I see, but once you get your first paycheck you'll be springing a big hotel suite, right? I mean, lead in a movie, they must be paying you a lot?",47

S09E01 No One Proposes.txt,Ross,What?! When have I ever touched myself in front of you guys?,19
S09E01 No One Proposes.txt,Phoebe,"Oh please! Just before when you were asleep in the lounge! That Armenian family was watching you instead of the TV. Oh, that reminds me. That Mr. Hasmeje still has my Gameboy.",19
S09E01 No One Proposes.txt,Chandler,Sure.,20
S09E01 No One Proposes.txt,Joey,Dude I just did something terrible.,20
S09E01 No One Proposes.txt,Chandler,That was you?! I thought it was Jack!,20
S09E01 No One Proposes.txt,Joey,"No! No, that was Jack! Rachel thinks I asked her to marry me!",20
S09E01 No One Proposes.txt,Chandler,What?! Why does she think that?,20
S09E01 No One Proposes.txt,Joey,Because it kinda looked like I did.,20
S09E01 No One Proposes.txt,Chandler,"Again, what?!",20
S09E01 No One Proposes.txt,Joey,"Okay well, I was down on one knee with the ring in my hand…",20
S09E01 No One Proposes.txt,Chandler,As we all are at some point during the day.,20
S09E01 No One Proposes.txt,Joey,It wasn’t my ring! It fell out of Ross’s jacket! And when I knelt down to pick it up Rachel thought I was proposing!,20
S09E01 No One Proposes.txt,Chandler,Ross had a ring?! And he was gonna propose?,20
S09E01 No One Proposes.txt,Joey,I guess.,20
S09E01 No One Proposes.txt,Chandler,And you did it first?! This is gonna kill him! You know how much he loves to propose!,20
S09E01 No One Proposes.txt,Joey,I know! I know it’s awful.,20
S09E01 No One Proposes.txt,Chandler,"Well, what did she say?",20
S09E01 No One Proposes.txt,Chandler,Does Ross know?,21
S09E01 No One Proposes.txt,Joey,"Oh God, what the hell am I going to tell him?",21
S09E01 No One Proposes.txt,Chandler,Well maybe you don’t have to tell him anything.,21
S09E01 No One Proposes.txt,Joey,"Oh, I like that. Yeah…",21
S09E01 No One Proposes.txt,Chandler,"If you clear things up with Rachel then Ross never needs to find out, but you have to do it now before he hears about it and kicks your ass!",21
S09E01 No One Proposes.txt,Monica,I want a baby.,22
S09E01 No One Proposes.txt,Chandler,"Honey, we’ve been over this. I need to be facing the other way.",22
S09E01 No One Proposes.txt,Monica,"Come on! Come on, if we have sex again it’ll double our chances of getting pregnant. Do you think that closet’s still available?",22
S09E01 No One Proposes.txt,Monica,Deal!,23
S09E01 No One Proposes.txt,Ross,Dad seriously! Y’know you really should see someone about that!,24
S09E01 No One Proposes.txt,Ross,"I wanna go talk to Rachel for a minute, are you gonna be okay alone for a bit?",24
S09E01 No One Proposes.txt,Phoebe,Hey!,26
S09E01 No One Proposes.txt,Rachel,Hi.,26
S09E01 No One Proposes.txt,Phoebe,Are you all right?,26
S09E01 No One Proposes.txt,Rachel,Uhh… I think I just got engaged.,26
S09E01 No One Proposes.txt,Phoebe,Oh my God! He did it?,26
S09E01 No One Proposes.txt,Rachel,Well…did you know he was gonna ask me?,26
S09E01 No One Proposes.txt,Phoebe,Are you kidding? I’m like the one who talked him into it. I like to think of myself as the puppet master of the group.,26
S09E01 No One Proposes.txt,Rachel,And you really think this is a good idea?,26
S09E01 No One Proposes.txt,Phoebe,"I just talked him into it, don’t tell me I have to do you too. The puppet master gets tired people.",26
S09E01 No One Proposes.txt,Rachel,I just don’t know! It just doesn’t feel right.,26
S09E01 No One Proposes.txt,Phoebe,"Why?! You two are so meant to be together, everybody thinks so.",26
S09E01 No One Proposes.txt,Rachel,Really?! Even Ross?,26
S09E01 No One Proposes.txt,Phoebe,Especially Ross!,26
S09E01 No One Proposes.txt,Phoebe,"There he goes, your fianc�e.",28
S09E01 No One Proposes.txt,Rachel,I guess so.,28
S09E01 No One Proposes.txt,Phoebe,Although he does play with himself in his sleep.,28
S09E01 No One Proposes.txt,Rachel,I can’t say that I’m surprised.,28
S09E01 No One Proposes.txt,Ross,"Dad, what are you doing?",29
S09E01 No One Proposes.txt,Joey,"It can’t be me, I’m standing right here.",30
S09E01 No One Proposes.txt,Ross,No!,30
S09E01 No One Proposes.txt,Chandler,"Hello sir, you know Monica.",33
S09E01 No One Proposes.txt,Joey,"Hey uh, is it okay to come in?",34
S09E01 No One Proposes.txt,Rachel,"Of course! Oh Joey, this ring I…it’s beautiful I love it!",34
S09E01 No One Proposes.txt,Joey,"Yeah uh look Rach, there’s something I gotta tell ya.",34
S09E01 No One Proposes.txt,Rachel,Hey!,35
S09E01 No One Proposes.txt,Nurse,Hey! Are you ready to try nursing again?,35
S09E01 No One Proposes.txt,Rachel,"Yeah! Hi Emma. Hey, why do you think she won’t take my breast?",35
S09E01 No One Proposes.txt,Nurse,"It’s all right honey, it takes some babies a while to get it, but don’t worry. It’ll happen.",35
S09E01 No One Proposes.txt,Rachel,"Okay sweetie, you can do it. Just open up and put it in your mouth.",36
S09E01 No One Proposes.txt,Joey,Dear Lord.,36
S09E01 No One Proposes.txt,Rachel,"I’m sorry honey, what were you saying?",36
S09E01 No One Proposes.txt,Joey,"Oh uh-uh yeah, I think that…",36
S09E01 No One Proposes.txt,Joey,"Y’know, I don’t really know her.",37
S09E01 No One Proposes.txt,Rachel,It’s just so frustrating! Why doesn’t she want my breast?!,39
S09E01 No One Proposes.txt,Phoebe,Oh hey! Wait up!,41
S09E01 No One Proposes.txt,Ross,Hi!,41
S09E01 No One Proposes.txt,Phoebe,Congratulations! I didn’t want to say anything in front of Joey ‘cause I didn’t know if he knew yet.,41
S09E01 No One Proposes.txt,Ross,"What, that we had a baby? Come on let’s give him a little credit, although, he did eat a piece of plastic fruit earlier.",41
S09E01 No One Proposes.txt,Phoebe,"No! No, that you and Rachel are engaged!",41
S09E01 No One Proposes.txt,Ross,What?,41
S09E01 No One Proposes.txt,Phoebe,"Oh, it’s a secret. Oh goodie! Yes! We haven’t done the secret thing in a long time.",41
S09E01 No One Proposes.txt,Ross,"Phoebe, there is no secret. Okay? I didn’t propose.",41
S09E01 No One Proposes.txt,Phoebe,Are you lying? Is this like that time you tried to convince us that you were a doctor?,41
S09E01 No One Proposes.txt,Ross,"No! No, come on let her sleep! She’s so exhausted.",43
S09E01 No One Proposes.txt,Phoebe,Perhaps because you gave her an engagement ring? Y’know Ross doctors are supposed to be smart.,45
S09E01 No One Proposes.txt,Ross,I didn’t give her that ring!,45
S09E01 No One Proposes.txt,Phoebe,Really?,45
S09E01 No One Proposes.txt,Ross,No!,45
S09E01 No One Proposes.txt,Phoebe,So whose ring is it?,45
S09E01 No One Proposes.txt,Ross,It’s mine.,45
S09E01 No One Proposes.txt,Phoebe,Is it an engagement ring?,45
S09E01 No One Proposes.txt,Ross,Yes!,45
S09E01 No One Proposes.txt,Phoebe,But you didn’t give it to her?,45
S09E01 No One Proposes.txt,Ross,No!,45
S09E01 No One Proposes.txt,Phoebe,But you were going to propose?,45
S09E01 No One Proposes.txt,Ross,No!!,45
S09E01 No One Proposes.txt,Phoebe,"Huh, I might be losing interest in this.",45
S09E01 No One Proposes.txt,Ross,"Look. Look, my mom gave me that ring because she wanted me to propose to Rachel, but all I wanted to do is if she maybe…kinda…wanted ah…start…things up again.",45
S09E01 No One Proposes.txt,Phoebe,"Oh, what beautiful lukewarm sentiment.",45
S09E01 No One Proposes.txt,Ross,"Look, I didn’t want to rush into anything. And it seemed like she didn’t want to either. But I don’t, I don’t understand how any of this happened! What? Did she find the ring in my jacket, assume that I was going to propose, throw it on, and-and just start telling people?",45
S09E01 No One Proposes.txt,Phoebe,"No! No, she said you actually proposed to her.",45
S09E01 No One Proposes.txt,Chandler,"Look, we can’t stay in here forever.",47

S09E01 No One Proposes.txt,Joey,"No! No, and I did not ask her to marry me!",57

S04E13 Rachels Crush.txt,Rachel,"No, but they stuck me in personal shopping. Which is just a huge step down!",12
S04E13 Rachels Crush.txt,Phoebe,Personal shopping? What is that? Like where you walk around with snooty rich people and tell them what to buy?,12

S04E13 Rachels Crush.txt,Phoebe,That’s a good idea for a business!,17
S04E13 Rachels Crush.txt,Chandler,"I’m totally screwed. Okay, they are gonna be hot and heavy on stage every night, and then they’re gonna go to their cast parties and he’s gonna try to undermine me.

S04E13 Rachels Crush.txt,Chandler,"All right, look, look, what am I gonna do?",18
S04E13 Rachels Crush.txt,Joey,"Chandler, look they’re actors. They’re there to do a job, just ‘cause they work together, doesn’t mean they’re gonna get together. I mean just ‘cause it happened with Susan Sarandon and Tim Robbins, it doesn’t mean it’s gonna happen with them.",18

S04E13 Rachels Crush.txt,Ross,Oh yeah!,18
S04E13 Rachels Crush.txt,Joey,"Well okay, so then you’re fine. The rule is when two actors are actually doing it off-stage all the sexual tension between them is gone. Okay? So as long as it’s hot onstage you got nothing to worry about. It’s when the heat goes away, that’s when you’re in trouble.",18
S04E13 Rachels Crush.txt,Chandler,Really?,18
S04E13 Rachels Crush.txt,Joey,"Look, you guys have been to every play I’ve ever been in, have I ever had chemistry on stage?",18

S04E13 Rachels Crush.txt,Rachel,"Well, at least that’s a great suit.",28
S04E13 Rachels Crush.txt,Rachel,Okay.,29
S04E13 Rachels Crush.txt,Chandler,"I’m right! Right? There was like no chemistry between them. Before they had heat, and now there’s no heat! Now you know what this means, Joey told us what this means!",34
S04E13 Rachels Crush.txt,Ross,"All right, let’s not jump to any conclusions. All right? There was some sexual chemistry between them.",34
S04E13 Rachels Crush.txt,Chandler,"Come on, it was like cousins having sex up there!",34
S04E13 Rachels Crush.txt,Ross,"Here she comes. Don’t say a word, okay? Just be cool, don’t be…y'know you.",34
S04E13 Rachels Crush.txt,Kathy,Hey you guys!,34
S04E13 Rachels Crush.txt,Ross,Hey!,34
S04E13 Rachels Crush.txt,Kathy,Wasn’t Nick funny when he couldn’t get his match lit?,36

S04E13 Rachels Crush.txt,Chandler,"Oh, I loved the play. You were great, and Nick ditto. Clearly you’re having sex with him.",38
S04E13 Rachels Crush.txt,Kathy,"Clearly, I’m having sex with him?",39
S04E13 Rachels Crush.txt,Chandler,"Oh come on, it was so obvious! There was no chemistry between you two!",39
S04E13 Rachels Crush.txt,Kathy,"Okay, so let me just get this straight. You’re accusing me of cheating on you, and insulting my performance?",39
S04E13 Rachels Crush.txt,Chandler,"Y’know, I-I could see how this could happen, y'know you’re up there every night, you’re naked, touching, kissing.",39
S04E13 Rachels Crush.txt,Kathy,"Acting! Chandler, this is my job! I’m-I’m playing a part in a play! How can you not trust me?!",39
S04E13 Rachels Crush.txt,Chandler,"Well, you can understand, given how we started.",39
S04E13 Rachels Crush.txt,Kathy,"Oh, wow. I can’t believe you’re throwing that in my face.",39
S04E13 Rachels Crush.txt,Chandler,"Well, that is what happened, and I don’t even see you denying this!",39
S04E13 Rachels Crush.txt,Kathy,"I’ll tell you what, Chandler, why don’t you call me when you grow up!",39
S04E13 Rachels Crush.txt,Chandler,"Yeah, well, don’t expect that to happen anytime soon!",39

S04E13 Rachels Crush.txt,Phoebe,What? What?,44
S04E13 Rachels Crush.txt,Rachel,"Well, it was just something Josh said about v-necks, but you had to be there.",44
S04E13 Rachels Crush.txt,Ross,"Yeah, how does Jason look in a v-neck?",44

S04E13 Rachels Crush.txt,Rachel,"Why? Honey, what is the big deal?",46
S04E13 Rachels Crush.txt,Monica,"I’m the hostess! Not those guys! I’m always the hostess! I mean, I was always the hostess, I mean even when I was little, I mean the girls brought their dollies to my tea party, I-I served the best air.",46
S04E13 Rachels Crush.txt,Phoebe,"Well, why did you make like a whole big thing out of y'know, everyone has to hang out in the big apartment?",46

S04E13 Rachels Crush.txt,Phoebe,"If you wanted to punish them, you should’ve just made them hang out here!",46

S04E13 Rachels Crush.txt,Phoebe,Why don’t you ask him out?,54
S04E13 Rachels Crush.txt,Joey,"Oh, yeah, totally! That’s such a turn-on!",54
S04E13 Rachels Crush.txt,Rachel,Really? It doesn’t seem desperate?,54
S04E13 Rachels Crush.txt,Joey,"Oh-ooh, that’s the turn-on.",54
S04E13 Rachels Crush.txt,Phoebe,He just got a divorce right?,54
S04E13 Rachels Crush.txt,Rachel,Hmm-mmm.,54

S04E13 Rachels Crush.txt,Rachel,"Ohh, God, I just got so nervous that he would say no.",58
S04E13 Rachels Crush.txt,Joey,"Well, you gotta give him something that he can’t say no too. Like uh, Knicks tickets! Invite the guy to a Knicks game, you’re guaranteed he’ll say yes!",58
S04E13 Rachels Crush.txt,Rachel,Really?! You think that will work?,58
S04E13 Rachels Crush.txt,Joey,"Absolutely! And if it doesn’t, can I get the extra ticket?",58
S04E13 Rachels Crush.txt,Joey,What the heck is that?,59
S04E13 Rachels Crush.txt,Chandler,Did she call?,61
S04E13 Rachels Crush.txt,Phoebe,"No, sorry.",61
S04E13 Rachels Crush.txt,Chandler,"All right, maybe I should call her.",61
S04E13 Rachels Crush.txt,Joey,"No! Forget her, man! You don’t need her, you don’t need that!",61
S04E13 Rachels Crush.txt,Ross,"He’s right, what she did was unforgivable.",61
S04E13 Rachels Crush.txt,Chandler,"Well, yeah, but y'know, what-what if I was wrong?",61
S04E13 Rachels Crush.txt,Ross,How might you be wrong?,61
S04E13 Rachels Crush.txt,Chandler,"Well y'know, what if she didn’t actually sleep with the guy?",61
S04E13 Rachels Crush.txt,Joey,"Dude, tell me she actually told you this.",61
S04E13 Rachels Crush.txt,Chandler,"She did not have to tell me, I saw the play, and there was no heat. Back me up here, Ross!",61
S04E13 Rachels Crush.txt,Ross,That’s all you’re basing this on?,61
S04E13 Rachels Crush.txt,Chandler,"That’s not backing me up! Look, you said with the off-stage and the heat, and the onstage and the oy heat.",61
S04E13 Rachels Crush.txt,Joey,"Whoa-whoa, that-that was just a theory! There’s a lot of theories that didn’t pan out. The lone gunman. Communism. Geometry.",61
S04E13 Rachels Crush.txt,Chandler,Oh my God!!,61
S04E13 Rachels Crush.txt,Joshua,What do you think?,63
S04E13 Rachels Crush.txt,Rachel,"Oh! Well, as a single woman, who is available, I think you look great!",63

S04E13 Rachels Crush.txt,Rachel,Really?,68
S04E13 Rachels Crush.txt,Joshua,Hi!,69
S04E13 Rachels Crush.txt,Chandler,"Hey. I just, I just wanted to come over to-to say that I’m sorry. Y’know? I know I acted like the biggest idiot in the world, and I can completely understand why you were so upset.",72
S04E13 Rachels Crush.txt,Kathy,Oh wow. I really wish you’d call me.,72
S04E13 Rachels Crush.txt,Kathy,Yeah.,73
S04E13 Rachels Crush.txt,Chandler,"Yeah. Well, I think our second fight is going to be a big one!",73
S04E13 Rachels Crush.txt,Joey,"Okay, for next time, what do you say?",74
S04E13 Rachels Crush.txt,Rachel,"I have an extra ticket. An extra ticket. Not, two tickets, I have an extra ticket.",74
S04E13 Rachels Crush.txt,Ross,"So the first time you ask a guy out, he-he turns you down?",74
S04E13 Rachels Crush.txt,Rachel,"He didn’t turn me down! He’s at the game isn’t he? I got the date, I’m just not on it!",74
S04E13 Rachels Crush.txt,Joey,What’s ready?,75
S04E13 Rachels Crush.txt,Monica,Just come.,75
S04E13 Rachels Crush.txt,Ross,Oh my God!,76
S04E13 Rachels Crush.txt,Rachel,Wow! Monica!,76
S04E13 Rachels Crush.txt,Phoebe,Great!,76
S04E13 Rachels Crush.txt,Ross,This is beautiful!,76
S04E13 Rachels Crush.txt,Phoebe,Oh did you—what did you—did you work for two days straight?,77
S04E13 Rachels Crush.txt,Joey,"I don’t know, it looks the same.",78
S04E13 Rachels Crush.txt,Monica,You used to have carpet.,78
S04E13 Rachels Crush.txt,Joey,Oh yeah!,78
S04E13 Rachels Crush.txt,Monica,"So I made snacks. Please, just hang out okay? I’m just gonna rest my eyes just a little bit.",78
S04E13 Rachels Crush.txt,Ross,"Look, Mon, do you want us to uh, come back later?",78
S04E13 Rachels Crush.txt,Monica,"Oh no-no-no, stay, stay, stay, just keep talking. I’m always the hostess.",78
S04E13 Rachels Crush.txt,Ross,Hey!,79
S04E13 Rachels Crush.txt,Joey,How’d it go?,79
S04E13 Rachels Crush.txt,Chandler,"Well, she wasn’t sleeping with him.",79
S04E13 Rachels Crush.txt,Phoebe,Oh good!,79
S04E13 Rachels Crush.txt,Chandler,She is now.,79
S04E13 Rachels Crush.txt,Ross,What are you saying?,79
S04E13 Rachels Crush.txt,Chandler,"I’m saying that she… is a devil woman! Y’know I mean you think you know someone and then they turn around and they sleep with Nick! Nick, with his rock hard pecs, and his giant man-nipples! I hate him, I hate her! Well, I don’t hate her, I love her. This is all my fault really.",79
S04E13 Rachels Crush.txt,Phoebe,How? How is your fault?,79
S04E13 Rachels Crush.txt,Chandler,"Because, I-I should’ve called! Y’know if I had just called her after our big, stupid fight, she never would’ve gone out with Nick, and they would’ve ended up in bed together. I threw her at his man nipples!",79
S04E13 Rachels Crush.txt,Rachel,"Honey, this is not your fault, just because you guys had a fight, it does not justify her sleeping with someone.",79
S04E13 Rachels Crush.txt,Ross,"Well, if-if she thought they were on a break…",79
S04E13 Rachels Crush.txt,Rachel,Really?,81
S08E08 The Stripper.txt,Phoebe,Huh?,3
S08E08 The Stripper.txt,Rachel,"I’m having dinner with my dad tomorrow night, do you wanna come?",3
S08E08 The Stripper.txt,Phoebe,"Sure. Yeah, he’s kinda sexy.",3
S08E08 The Stripper.txt,Rachel,"Oh no, no, I’ll be there too.",3
S08E08 The Stripper.txt,Phoebe,"Okay so, we’ll just come up with some kind of signal if it’s going well you can take off.",3
S08E08 The Stripper.txt,Rachel,No Phoebe! I just need you there for support. I haven’t told him I’m pregnant yet.,3
S08E08 The Stripper.txt,Phoebe,Oh. Why not?,3
S08E08 The Stripper.txt,Rachel,‘Cause I know he’s gonna flip out and I hate it when he’s angry.,3
S08E08 The Stripper.txt,Phoebe,"Oh Rachel, this is all so ‘Papa don’t preach.’",3
S08E08 The Stripper.txt,Rachel,What Phoebe? Wait! One time he caught me smoking he said if he ever saw me doing that again he’d make me eat the entire pack.,3
S08E08 The Stripper.txt,Phoebe,"Wow! Oh well, I will be there!",3
S08E08 The Stripper.txt,Rachel,Thank you.,3
S08E08 The Stripper.txt,Phoebe,Oh my God!!! Monica!! He’s the stripper from your bachelorette party!!,6
S08E08 The Stripper.txt,Chandler,Her what?!!,6
S08E08 The Stripper.txt,Phoebe,Your secret bachelorette party…,6
S08E08 The Stripper.txt,Chandler,You had a bachelorette party?!,6
S08E08 The Stripper.txt,Chandler,"I thought we weren’t gonna have bachelor/bachelorette parties! Y’know, we agreed that it was a silly tradition.",7
S08E08 The Stripper.txt,Joey,It’s a grand tradition!,7
S08E08 The Stripper.txt,Monica,"I’m sorry, they surprised me. There was nothing I could do!",7
S08E08 The Stripper.txt,Rachel,Well you could’ve untied it with your hands.,7
S08E08 The Stripper.txt,Joey,"This is so unfair! The one thing I wanted to do was throw my best friend a bachelor party, but no, I wasn’t allowed to. All I got was a stupid steak dinner!",7
S08E08 The Stripper.txt,Chandler,You went home with the waitress.,7
S08E08 The Stripper.txt,Joey,"Oh yeah, that was a pretty good night.",7
S08E08 The Stripper.txt,Chandler,I can’t believe you didn’t tell me! You know that the two pillars of marriage are openness and honesty!,7
S08E08 The Stripper.txt,Monica,"Ugh, I knew giving you that book was gonna come back and bite me in the ass!",7
S08E08 The Stripper.txt,Phoebe,"Oh, I-I don’t eat meat.",8
S08E08 The Stripper.txt,Phoebe,"Yeah, I don’t eat that either.",8
S08E08 The Stripper.txt,Rachel,Well actually umm…,9
S08E08 The Stripper.txt,Phoebe,"He’s right though, the ’74 is absolute piss.",14
S08E08 The Stripper.txt,Rachel,"This was such a huge mistake. I can’t tell him Phoebe. I can’t, I can’t, I can’t, I can’t…",14
S08E08 The Stripper.txt,Phoebe,Rachel!,14
S08E08 The Stripper.txt,Rachel,"No it’s okay, this is what’s gonna happen. I’m gonna wait a couple years and then the baby will tell him.",14
S08E08 The Stripper.txt,Phoebe,"Why, so he can get mad at the baby?",14
S08E08 The Stripper.txt,Rachel,"Well… Umm, I got TiVo.",15
S08E08 The Stripper.txt,Phoebe,It’s slang for pregnant.,15
S08E08 The Stripper.txt,Rachel,Phoebe!,15
S08E08 The Stripper.txt,Rachel,"Well uh, yes and no. Except not no. So to sum it up, yeah.",15
S08E08 The Stripper.txt,Rachel,Yeah.,17
S08E08 The Stripper.txt,Rachel,Who?,18
S08E08 The Stripper.txt,Rachel,February 2nd!,19
S08E08 The Stripper.txt,Mona,So it was really cool seeing you lecture today.,21
S08E08 The Stripper.txt,Ross,Oh thanks. Although it kinda seemed like you were falling asleep there a little.,21
S08E08 The Stripper.txt,Mona,"Oh no-no, I-I had my eyes closed so I could concentrate and y’know take it all in.",21
S08E08 The Stripper.txt,Ross,"Yeah, a lot of my students do that.",21
S08E08 The Stripper.txt,Mona,"So, I gotta get going.",21
S08E08 The Stripper.txt,Ross,"Okay, I-I’ll see you tonight.",21
S08E08 The Stripper.txt,Mona,Yeah.,21
S08E08 The Stripper.txt,Ross,"Okay, bye.",21
S08E08 The Stripper.txt,Chandler,My God! You must be good in bed!,23
S08E08 The Stripper.txt,Joey,"So uh, you and Mona, been a while now. How’s it going?",23
S08E08 The Stripper.txt,Ross,"Ah, it’s good. It’s going good. I mean, we get along great. She’s, she’s so…",23
S08E08 The Stripper.txt,Joey,Hot?,23
S08E08 The Stripper.txt,Ross,"Well, I was gonna say sweet, but yeah-huh!",23
S08E08 The Stripper.txt,Chandler,She’s okay with Rachel and the baby?,23
S08E08 The Stripper.txt,Ross,"Well I…I haven’t actually told her yet. I don’t want to scare her off, y’know?",23
S08E08 The Stripper.txt,Chandler,"Well, you have to honest with her! Otherwise you may think that you’re going down the same path, but you’re really going down different ones.",23
S08E08 The Stripper.txt,Joey,I’m gonna take that book and beat you to death with it.,23
S08E08 The Stripper.txt,Chandler,What?,24
S08E08 The Stripper.txt,Monica,"Yeah, I got this number from this guy at work and I hired a stripper to come dance for you. Am I going in the wife hall of fame or what?!",24
S08E08 The Stripper.txt,Chandler,Honey! That’s crazy! I don’t want you to get me a stripper…,24
S08E08 The Stripper.txt,Joey,Will you let the lady talk?!,24
S08E08 The Stripper.txt,Monica,"Come on! Come on, it’ll be fun! It’ll make me feel so much better.",24
S08E08 The Stripper.txt,Chandler,"Look, I appreciate it, but uh, it’s a little creepy. Y’know? I’m not a bachelor anymore.",24
S08E08 The Stripper.txt,Monica,"So don’t think of it as a bachelor party, think of it as a…a two month anniversary present.",24
S08E08 The Stripper.txt,Monica,Please! I feel so bad! Just watch the hot woman get naked!,25
S08E08 The Stripper.txt,Chandler,All right fine! But I’m only doing this for you!,25
S08E08 The Stripper.txt,Joey,Yeah!,25
S08E08 The Stripper.txt,Chandler,And Joey.,25
S08E08 The Stripper.txt,Monica,"Thank you. All right, now who else do you want to invite?",25
S08E08 The Stripper.txt,Chandler,"Ah, no-no-no just Ross. Ross and Joey is embarrassing enough.",25
S08E08 The Stripper.txt,Ross,"Uh actually, sorry I can’t even make it. I’m seeing Mona again tonight.",25
S08E08 The Stripper.txt,Chandler,I understand: who would cancel an actual date to go to a fake bachelor party?,25
S08E08 The Stripper.txt,Phoebe,"I’m sorry I won’t be able to make it to your imaginary wedding, but I’m really busy that day. Yeah, I already have a unicorn baptism and a leprechaun bar mitzvah.",27
S08E08 The Stripper.txt,Rachel,"I know. I know. I panicked, I panicked. I didn’t want him to start yelling at me like I was some ’74 Latour.",27
S08E08 The Stripper.txt,Phoebe,It’s Lafite. The ’74 Latour is actually drinking quite nicely.,27
S08E08 The Stripper.txt,Rachel,"All right here he comes. I’m gonna do this, I’m gonna tell him, I’m gonna be strong.",27
S08E08 The Stripper.txt,Rachel,Yeah?,27
S08E08 The Stripper.txt,Rachel,There’s not gonna be a wedding. Ross and I are not getting married.,28
S08E08 The Stripper.txt,Rachel,I’m sorry daddy.,28
S08E08 The Stripper.txt,Rachel,"Oh now daddy, stay calm. Please.",28
S08E08 The Stripper.txt,Rachel,"Yes. Yes, he says I’m damaged goods.",28
S08E08 The Stripper.txt,Joey,"So you uh, nervous about getting married?",29
S08E08 The Stripper.txt,Chandler,What are you doing?,29
S08E08 The Stripper.txt,Joey,"Look, look let’s pretend it’s a real bachelor party. Okay? Y’know? Before your wedding. Come on, it’ll be fun.",29
S08E08 The Stripper.txt,Chandler,Okay. I can’t believe tomorrow’s the big day.,29
S08E08 The Stripper.txt,Joey,How does it feel knowing you’re never gonna be with another woman again huh? Knowing you’re gonna have to wake up to the same face everyday until you finally have the sweet release of death.,29
S08E08 The Stripper.txt,Chandler,"You’re right, this is more fun.",29
S08E08 The Stripper.txt,Stripper,Hi!,31
S08E08 The Stripper.txt,Stripper,So which one of you lucky boys is Chandler?,32
S08E08 The Stripper.txt,Joey,"Uh, that-that’s-that’s me!",32
S08E08 The Stripper.txt,Chandler,That’s me.,32
S08E08 The Stripper.txt,Joey,"Joey Tribbiani, a big fan.",32
S08E08 The Stripper.txt,Chandler,"Yeah, yeah right over there.",33
S08E08 The Stripper.txt,Chandler,That was weird.,34
S08E08 The Stripper.txt,Joey,Why-why would she go in the bedroom?,34
S08E08 The Stripper.txt,Stripper,I’m waiting.,34
S08E08 The Stripper.txt,Chandler,So she’s a…,35
S08E08 The Stripper.txt,Joey,"Yeah, that’s one naked hooker!",35
S08E08 The Stripper.txt,Ross,Uh that’s an eighteenth century Indian artifact from Calcutta.,37
S08E08 The Stripper.txt,Mona,"Oh wow! So, you’re more than just dinosaurs.",37
S08E08 The Stripper.txt,Ross,So much more.,37
S08E08 The Stripper.txt,Mona,Oh my God! Oh my God! I’m so sorry!,38
S08E08 The Stripper.txt,Ross,Y’know this is actually not a great time for me.,39
S08E08 The Stripper.txt,Mona,You got Rachel pregnant?!,40
S08E08 The Stripper.txt,Ross,Who did?!,40
S08E08 The Stripper.txt,Ross,"No! No sir umm, she means a lot to me. I mean, I care—I-I love Rachel.",41
S08E08 The Stripper.txt,Mona,What?!,41
S08E08 The Stripper.txt,Mona,Wh…,43
S08E08 The Stripper.txt,Mona,Tramp?!,44
S08E08 The Stripper.txt,Ross,"I’m sorry. Dr. Green, Mona. Mona, Dr. Green.",44
S08E08 The Stripper.txt,Chandler,I can’t believe there is a naked hooker in there!,45
S08E08 The Stripper.txt,Joey,"Wait! Wait! Maybe she’s a hooker and a stripper, but she got confused about what she’s supposed to do.",45
S08E08 The Stripper.txt,Joey,"Maybe Monica’s playing a joke on ya. Y’know? Getting her own husband a hooker, that’s pretty funny.",47
S08E08 The Stripper.txt,Chandler,"That is funny, maybe for my birthday she’ll murder someone.",47
S08E08 The Stripper.txt,Joey,I bet Ross was in on it too. I mean he was conveniently busy.,47
S08E08 The Stripper.txt,Hooker,Do you mind if I smoke in here?,47
S08E08 The Stripper.txt,Chandler,"Oh actually, I’d rather you…Yeah, go ahead. We’re gonna have to burn that room down anyway.",47
S08E08 The Stripper.txt,Mona,How could you have kept all of this from me?,48
S08E08 The Stripper.txt,Ross,"I was going to tell you, but…",48
S08E08 The Stripper.txt,Ross,"No! No! No! No! No! I-I-I-I—I need to, I need to lie down.",50
S08E08 The Stripper.txt,Stu,"So, tonight’s the night of the big bachelor party?",51
S08E08 The Stripper.txt,Monica,Yeah! Hey! Thanks for getting me that girl’s number.,51
S08E08 The Stripper.txt,Stu,No problem. So who’s the party for?,51
S08E08 The Stripper.txt,Monica,My husband.,51
S08E08 The Stripper.txt,Stu,You hired your husband a hooker?,51
S08E08 The Stripper.txt,Monica,She’s a stripper.,51
S08E08 The Stripper.txt,Stu,"No, she’s a hooker.",51
S08E08 The Stripper.txt,Monica,"Is that, is that what they call strippers sometimes?",51
S08E08 The Stripper.txt,Stu,When they’re hookers.,51
S08E08 The Stripper.txt,Monica,Oh my God Stu! I-I can’t believe you did this! Now are you absolutely sure she’s a hooker?,51
S08E08 The Stripper.txt,Stu,"Either that or she’s just the best, most expensive date I ever had.",51
S08E08 The Stripper.txt,Joey,Maybe she meant to get you a hooker.,53
S08E08 The Stripper.txt,Chandler,Why would she do that?,53
S08E08 The Stripper.txt,Joey,"Maybe she wants you to learn something. Huh? Now is there anything you’re really bad at y’know, sexually?",53
S08E08 The Stripper.txt,Chandler,This is the worst bachelor party ever!,53
S08E08 The Stripper.txt,Hooker,What’s taking you boys so long?,53
S08E08 The Stripper.txt,Joey,In a minute!,53
S08E08 The Stripper.txt,Joey,"All right, all right maybe-maybe you should just ask her to leave.",54
S08E08 The Stripper.txt,Chandler,Why me?!,54
S08E08 The Stripper.txt,Joey,Hey! It’s your bachelor party.,54
S08E08 The Stripper.txt,Chandler,Which is why you should do it.,54
S08E08 The Stripper.txt,Joey,I don’t want to. You do it!,54
S08E08 The Stripper.txt,Chandler,You do it!,54
S08E08 The Stripper.txt,Joey,You do it!,54
S08E08 The Stripper.txt,Joey,I miss this.,55
S08E08 The Stripper.txt,Chandler,I don’t think we’ve actually done this before!,55
S08E08 The Stripper.txt,Joey,"No, I-I miss hanging out with you.",55
S08E08 The Stripper.txt,Chandler,Well we…we still hang out.,55
S08E08 The Stripper.txt,Joey,Not like we used to. Remember? You and me used to be inseparable. Y’know now it’s like…things are different.,55
S08E08 The Stripper.txt,Chandler,"Well y’know, things are different. I’m…I’m married now.",55
S08E08 The Stripper.txt,Joey,"Oh sure—And hey, don’t get me wrong, I am so happy for you guys. I just…I miss…hanging out…just-just us, y’know?",55
S08E08 The Stripper.txt,Chandler,"Yeah, I miss that too. I tell you what; from now on we’ll make time to hang out with each other.",55
S08E08 The Stripper.txt,Ross,So your dad dropped by. He’s a pleasant man!,59
S08E08 The Stripper.txt,Rachel,"Ross I’m so sorry. Okay. I-I will promise I will straighten this out with him tomorrow in person, or via e-mail.",61
S08E08 The Stripper.txt,Ross,I don’t care about your dad! I care about Mona! She was there and now she’s totally freaked out!,61
S08E08 The Stripper.txt,Rachel,"Oh okay, I’ll fix that to. What’s her e-mail address?",61
S08E08 The Stripper.txt,Ross,Rachel!,61
S08E08 The Stripper.txt,Rachel,"All right, I promise. I’ll fix this. I swear. I’ll-I’ll-I’ll-I’ll talk to her.",61
S08E08 The Stripper.txt,Ross,Okay!,61
S08E08 The Stripper.txt,Rachel,Okay.,61
S08E08 The Stripper.txt,Ross,Thank you!,61
S08E08 The Stripper.txt,Phoebe,"That’s it?! You call that a fight? Come on! ""We were on a break!"" ""No we weren’t!"" What happened to you two?!",61
S08E08 The Stripper.txt,Ross,Thank you so much for coming back over.,62
S08E08 The Stripper.txt,Mona,"Oh good, you’re here. Yeah, and I was worried that it was going to be uncomfortable.",62
S08E08 The Stripper.txt,Rachel,"I know Mona, just hear me out. First of all, I’m so sorry about my father yelling at you, but I heard you totally held your own. You’re gonna have to tell me how you did that.",62
S08E08 The Stripper.txt,Ross,Focus.,62
S08E08 The Stripper.txt,Rachel,"Okay. Um…But—Okay, yes Ross and I used to date. And yes we are gonna have a baby. But we are definitely not getting back together.",62
S08E08 The Stripper.txt,Mona,How can I be sure on that?,62
S08E08 The Stripper.txt,Rachel,Oh we just—we drove each other crazy!,62
S08E08 The Stripper.txt,Ross,Yeah.,62
S08E08 The Stripper.txt,Rachel,"I mean he was possessive, he was jealous, he could never just let the little things go!",62
S08E08 The Stripper.txt,Ross,Trying to date this woman.,62
S08E08 The Stripper.txt,Ross,Probably shouldn’t touch me.,63
S08E08 The Stripper.txt,Mona,"Y’know, I-I-I just…I don’t want to get in the middle of something so complicated.",63
S08E08 The Stripper.txt,Ross,Should I leave this open for you too?,64
S08E08 The Stripper.txt,Mona,I’m not sure yet. Why didn’t you just tell me about all this?,64
S08E08 The Stripper.txt,Ross,Because what’s going on with Rachel has nothing to do with how I feel about you.,64
S08E08 The Stripper.txt,Mona,Yeah? Well you still shoulda told me.,64
S08E08 The Stripper.txt,Ross,"I know and I was going to, but I thought it was better that you heard it from Rachel’s father. Look I…I made a mistake, but it’s only because I really, really like you. Really!",64
S08E08 The Stripper.txt,Monica,I swear I didn’t know she was a hooker! I mean wh—Did you let her smoke in here?,67
S08E08 The Stripper.txt,Chandler,"Her ass print is still on your grandmother’s quilt, do you really want to talk about smoking?",67
S08E08 The Stripper.txt,Chandler,Monica! Wait!,68
S08E08 The Stripper.txt,Monica,What?,68
S08E08 The Stripper.txt,Chandler,Could you not narrate?,71
S08E08 The Stripper.txt,Rachel,About an hour ago.,75
S08E08 The Stripper.txt,Phoebe,Wanna go see a movie?,75
S04E07 Chandler Crosses The Line.txt,Ross,"Y'know if we ever go to war and you’re captured, you’re in for a big surprise.",3
S04E07 Chandler Crosses The Line.txt,Phoebe,Wow! Could everyone totally see up his robe?,5
S04E07 Chandler Crosses The Line.txt,All,Yeah! Oh my God!,5
S04E07 Chandler Crosses The Line.txt,Casey,Here you go.,6

S07E20 Rachels Big Kiss.txt,Joey,"Yeah, they’re not coming.",53
S07E20 Rachels Big Kiss.txt,Joey,Somehow they got the idea that you only invited them because of me. They…feel a little unwanted.,54
S07E20 Rachels Big Kiss.txt,Monica,"Oh that’s too bad. It’s true, but too bad.",54
S07E20 Rachels Big Kiss.txt,Joey,"Look Mon, if you could just call my mom…",54

S07E20 Rachels Big Kiss.txt,Monica,No she hasn’t.,54
S07E20 Rachels Big Kiss.txt,Joey,Is it her fault that some of them didn’t make it to you?,54
S07E20 Rachels Big Kiss.txt,Monica,"Well, what am I going to say?",54
S07E20 Rachels Big Kiss.txt,Rachel,"Oh. Oh, that’s great!",58

S07E20 Rachels Big Kiss.txt,Melissa,Yeah?,61

S07E20 Rachels Big Kiss.txt,Monica,How about a Youhoo with a funny straw?,63
S07E20 Rachels Big Kiss.txt,Monica,Hey.,65
S07E20 Rachels Big Kiss.txt,Joey,"Listen, I know the invitation says 6:00, but does that mean that you want people to get there at six, or the show is gonna start right at six?",65
S07E20 Rachels Big Kiss.txt,Monica,The show?!,65
S07E20 Rachels Big Kiss.txt,Joey,"Right. Right. The wedding, gotcha. But I mean, it’s gonna start a little late right? I mean, weddings start late. Right?",65

S07E20 Rachels Big Kiss.txt,Melissa,I’m sorry Ray-ray. I mean if I thought it happened I would say it. Maybe I passed out and you did stuff to me while I was sleeping.,67
S07E20 Rachels Big Kiss.txt,Rachel,No!!,67
S07E20 Rachels Big Kiss.txt,Phoebe,"Rachel, it’s okay. You don’t have to do this. I believe you. All right? Okay, if-if you say that you kissed Melissa, then you kissed Melissa.",67

S07E20 Rachels Big Kiss.txt,Ross,What?,71
S07E20 Rachels Big Kiss.txt,Chandler,An invitation for the At First Sight premiere? Oh my God! Val Kilmer didn’t wear this in Batman! He wore it to the premiere of some tooty-fruity love story where he played a blind guy!,71
S07E20 Rachels Big Kiss.txt,Monica,"All right that’s it, I give up! Whatever you want you can have it! You wanna sing a song? You wanna do a dance? You want your mom stand at the Alter and scream racial slurs? I don’t care!",74

S01E05 The East German Laundry Detergent.txt,Ross,"Yes, I do have a laundry room in my building, um, but there's a.... rat problem. Apparently they're attracted to the dryer sheets, and they're goin' in fine, but they're comin' out all.... fluffy. Anyway, say, sevenish?",13

S09E19 Rachels Dream.txt,Monica,"Wow, do you mean like kiss him-kiss him?",53
S09E19 Rachels Dream.txt,Rachel,"Oh yeah! I mean, that was pretty intense.",53
S09E19 Rachels Dream.txt,Monica,What do you think brought than on?,53
S09E19 Rachels Dream.txt,Rachel,"I don't know! I mean, maybe that's something to do with the fact that I saw him do a love scene yesterday.",53
S09E19 Rachels Dream.txt,Monica,A love scene? With who?,53
S09E19 Rachels Dream.txt,Rachel,Olivia.,53
S09E19 Rachels Dream.txt,Rachel,So do you think that my dream means anything?,54
S09E19 Rachels Dream.txt,Monica,"I don't know. I mean, you saw him do a love scene, so maybe you don't have a thing for Joey, maybe you have a thing for Drake.",54
S09E19 Rachels Dream.txt,Rachel,Ah! Well it was Joey reading Drake's lines in the dream...,54
S09E19 Rachels Dream.txt,Monica,"Of course it was! Trust me, when it comes to psychology I know what I'm talking about. I took two psych classes in college.",54

S09E19 Rachels Dream.txt,Monica,It was hard!,54
S09E19 Rachels Dream.txt,Phoebe,Hey!,55

S09E19 Rachels Dream.txt,Phoebe,"Right, yeah, ok, I'll ask the butler to fetch my diamonds out of the vault.",56
S09E19 Rachels Dream.txt,Monica,"Phoebe, it's not what you wear. It's sort of your songs... I just don't think you should play at the restaurant anymore.",56
S09E19 Rachels Dream.txt,Rachel,"Hey, so you guys, the funniest thing happened, at work...",58
S09E19 Rachels Dream.txt,Phoebe,My songs aren't good enough for your restaurant?,58
S09E19 Rachels Dream.txt,Rachel,"Ok, we're still on that.",58
S09E19 Rachels Dream.txt,Monica,I didn't say your songs were not good enough.,58
S09E19 Rachels Dream.txt,Phoebe,Then what's wrong with them? Would they not go with your tiny portions of pretentious food?,58
S09E19 Rachels Dream.txt,Monica,Tiny portions?,58
S09E19 Rachels Dream.txt,Monica,"Phoebe, it's not about quantity.",59
S09E19 Rachels Dream.txt,Phoebe,Well...it's not about quality.,59
S09E19 Rachels Dream.txt,Monica,"Oh really, you want to talk about quality? Have you heard of a key? It's what some people sing in.",59
S09E19 Rachels Dream.txt,Phoebe,"Well at least all my songs don't taste like garlic. Yeah, there are other ingredients Monica.",59
S09E19 Rachels Dream.txt,Monica,"Ok, so that's what we're doing. You know, when I'm in the coffee house bopping along to one of your songs, I'm wearing ear plugs.",59
S09E19 Rachels Dream.txt,Phoebe,"Ear plugs, or cloves of garlic?",59
S09E19 Rachels Dream.txt,Monica,"You know what? I take back what I said before. You keep playing at the restaurant, because with your music driving people inside, my bar sales are going up like crazy.",59
S09E19 Rachels Dream.txt,Phoebe,"What are people having, the garlic Martini?",59
S09E19 Rachels Dream.txt,Receptionist,"Here's your copy of the bill, we hope you enjoyed your stay.",60
S09E19 Rachels Dream.txt,Chandler,"Oh we did, and you still have all your lamps.",60
S09E19 Rachels Dream.txt,Chandler,"Oh, I didn't factor in the room tax.",61
S09E19 Rachels Dream.txt,Ross,"Oh dude, don't worry about it, I found an unattended maid's car. We're way ahead of the game.",61
S09E19 Rachels Dream.txt,Ross,Oh my god.,62
S09E19 Rachels Dream.txt,Chandler,What?,62
S09E19 Rachels Dream.txt,Ross,There's something new in the bowl.,62
S09E19 Rachels Dream.txt,Chandler,"Look, we have enough, just walk away.",62
S09E19 Rachels Dream.txt,Ross,"No, but I want...I want the pinecones!",62
S09E19 Rachels Dream.txt,Chandler,There's a forest right outside.,62
S09E19 Rachels Dream.txt,Ross,It's not the same.,62
S09E19 Rachels Dream.txt,Chandler,"Ok, go quick!",62
S09E19 Rachels Dream.txt,Ross,"Oh, my maple candy!",65
S09E19 Rachels Dream.txt,Monica,"Thank god, it's just you! I thought someone was swinging a bag of cats against the wall.",68
S09E19 Rachels Dream.txt,Phoebe,"You'd better get back in that kitchen Monica, the garlic is not gonna overuse itself.",68
S09E19 Rachels Dream.txt,Monica,"Ok, you have to stop playing now.",68
S09E19 Rachels Dream.txt,Phoebe,Why? The only person my playing is bothering is you!,68
S09E19 Rachels Dream.txt,Monica,"Oh yeah? Ok, let's settle this, come on!",68
S09E19 Rachels Dream.txt,Phoebe,"Ok, well, who identified the tone of this restaurant as pretentious comma garlicky?",72
S09E19 Rachels Dream.txt,Monica,I'm sorry...,76
S09E19 Rachels Dream.txt,Monica,ooohh... hey! Wanna stick around and I'll whip you up some dinner?,77

S09E19 Rachels Dream.txt,Joey,Hey!,80
S09E19 Rachels Dream.txt,Rachel,"Joey, do you have peanut butter on the back of your head?",80

S09E19 Rachels Dream.txt,Rachel,uh-huh,82
S09E19 Rachels Dream.txt,Joey,What?,84
S09E19 Rachels Dream.txt,Rachel,What...how is it going with Drake?,84
S09E19 Rachels Dream.txt,Joey,Oh...I don't think it's going very well...,84

S10E09 The Birth Mother.txt,Chandler,Thank you so much for agreeing to see us.,16
S10E09 The Birth Mother.txt,Erica,Hi.,16
S10E09 The Birth Mother.txt,Chandler,Ok.,16
S10E09 The Birth Mother.txt,Erica,"So, it's Monica and Chandler. I only know you as file 0W33815-D.",16
S10E09 The Birth Mother.txt,Chandler,That's what our friends call us.,16
S10E09 The Birth Mother.txt,Erica,"Gosh, you know, you're just such an amazing couple. It's... kind of intimidating.",16
S10E09 The Birth Mother.txt,Monica,I don't know about that.,16
S10E09 The Birth Mother.txt,Erica,"You're kidding me? I mean, it's enough that you are a doctor. But on top of it, you're married to a reverend?",16
S10E09 The Birth Mother.txt,Phoebe,Hey!,19
S10E09 The Birth Mother.txt,Joey,Hey.,19
S10E09 The Birth Mother.txt,Phoebe,"Oh, my friend Sarah had a great time last night.",19
S10E09 The Birth Mother.txt,Joey,Well...,19
S10E09 The Birth Mother.txt,Phoebe,Yeah! So you're gonna call this one back?,19
S10E09 The Birth Mother.txt,Joey,Nope.,19
S10E09 The Birth Mother.txt,Phoebe,What are you talking about? Sarah's great!,19
S10E09 The Birth Mother.txt,Phoebe,"That’s it? That’s why you won’t go out with her again? So, she took some fries, big deal!",21
S10E09 The Birth Mother.txt,Joey,"Hey, hey, look! It’s not about a few fries... it’s about what the fries represent.",21
S10E09 The Birth Mother.txt,Phoebe,What?,21
S10E09 The Birth Mother.txt,Joey,ALL FOOD!,21
S10E09 The Birth Mother.txt,Phoebe,"I’m sorry, I can’t believe I set you up with such a MONSTER!",21
S10E09 The Birth Mother.txt,Joey,"Hey, hey, hey, hey. Look. I take a girl out, she can order whatever she wants! The more, the better! All right? Just don’t order a Garden salad and then eat my food! That’s a good way to lose some fingers!",21
S10E09 The Birth Mother.txt,Rachel,Hi,23
S10E09 The Birth Mother.txt,Phoebe,Thank God you’re here. Listen to this!,23
S10E09 The Birth Mother.txt,Rachel,what?,23
S10E09 The Birth Mother.txt,Phoebe,Joey and my friend were out last night and having dinner and she reaches over and takes a few of his fries...,23
S10E09 The Birth Mother.txt,Rachel,"Oh! Oh, no!",23
S10E09 The Birth Mother.txt,Phoebe,What? You know about the plate thing?,24
S10E09 The Birth Mother.txt,Rachel,"Oh, yeah. Joey doesn’t share food. I mean, just last week we were having breakfast and he had a couple of grapes on his plate and ...",24
S10E09 The Birth Mother.txt,Rachel,Oh no! Not me! Emma!,25
S10E09 The Birth Mother.txt,Phoebe,"Well, I still think that it’s a stupid reason not to call someone again. You are calling her! And if you need to, just get an extra plate of fries for the table!",27
S10E09 The Birth Mother.txt,Ross,"You know, we should just go, I’m not gonna find anything here! This stuff is ridiculous!",30
S10E09 The Birth Mother.txt,Rachel,"Ah, this place is great!",31
S10E09 The Birth Mother.txt,Phoebe,Wow!,31
S10E09 The Birth Mother.txt,Rachel,"Yeah, down from seven hundred, you are saving like two hundred bucks!",34
S10E09 The Birth Mother.txt,Ross,Both logic and math are taking a serious hit today.,34
S10E09 The Birth Mother.txt,Ross,Wow!,35
S10E09 The Birth Mother.txt,Phoebe,Yeah!,35
S10E09 The Birth Mother.txt,Phoebe,What? They will be!,37
S10E09 The Birth Mother.txt,Ross,"All right, that’s it, I’m getting out of here.",37
S10E09 The Birth Mother.txt,Rachel,"No, no, no, no! Ross, wait! Come on! You know, there’s other stuff. Here’s a nice shirt, look at these nice pants...",37
S10E09 The Birth Mother.txt,Ross,"Uh, actually these might look pretty good on me.",37
S10E09 The Birth Mother.txt,Rachel,"Yes, they will! You know what you should do? Just go take a walk, all right? I know your size and I’m... I’m gonna pick up some really good stuff for you.",37
S10E09 The Birth Mother.txt,Ross,Really?,37
S10E09 The Birth Mother.txt,Rachel,"Yes! And I know what looks sexy on guys. Please, just wear what I suggest, and she’s gonna go nuts for you.",37
S10E09 The Birth Mother.txt,Ross,"So, you’re saying, uh, if I wear these pants I might be getting into hers?",37
S10E09 The Birth Mother.txt,Chandler,"So, the fact that I am a doctor, and my wife’s a reverend, that’s important to you?",39
S10E09 The Birth Mother.txt,Erica,"Yeah, I read some great applications, but then I thought “who better then a minister to raise a child!”",39
S10E09 The Birth Mother.txt,Monica,Amen.,39
S10E09 The Birth Mother.txt,Chandler,Plus I thought the baby would be in good hands with a doctor!,39
S10E09 The Birth Mother.txt,Erica,"Reverend, can I ask? Does the bible say anything about adoption?",40
S10E09 The Birth Mother.txt,Monica,It says “Do it!”. And behold she did adopt onto them a baby. And it was good.,40
S10E09 The Birth Mother.txt,Erica,Wow.,40
S10E09 The Birth Mother.txt,Chandler,"Yeah, wow.",40
S10E09 The Birth Mother.txt,Monica,"Oh, you know, my flock is good, I mean, yeah, my flock pretty much takes care of themselves at this point. Good flock. Flock, flock, flock.",41
S10E09 The Birth Mother.txt,Chandler,No-ot for me it doesn’t.,42
S10E09 The Birth Mother.txt,Erica,"We’re great, I think I may have asked all my questions.",43
S10E09 The Birth Mother.txt,Chandler,"Yeah, actually. So, you read a file that you liked and you gave the agency the serial number and they contacted us?",43
S10E09 The Birth Mother.txt,Chandler,You should be. You’re really on top of stuff..,43
S10E09 The Birth Mother.txt,Erica,"Actually, I don’t think we have to.",44
S10E09 The Birth Mother.txt,Monica,We don’t?,44
S10E09 The Birth Mother.txt,Chandler,"Yeah, I did.",46
S10E09 The Birth Mother.txt,Rachel,We got some really great stuff!,48
S10E09 The Birth Mother.txt,Phoebe,"Yeah, yeah but I am not sure about some of the bra's I got.",48
S10E09 The Birth Mother.txt,Rachel,Oh! Really? Do you wanna try some of them on for me?,48
S10E09 The Birth Mother.txt,Phoebe,"Oh! okay. Wait, are we in Joey's imagination?",48
S10E09 The Birth Mother.txt,Phoebe,"oh, well, Ross probably has it, you can get it from him later.",49
S10E09 The Birth Mother.txt,Joey,I think were not wearing the same shirt anymore!!,51
S10E09 The Birth Mother.txt,Ross,"Oh, I see, somebody is afraid of a little competition with the ladies?",53
S10E09 The Birth Mother.txt,Chandler,We are NOT signing those papers.,56
S10E09 The Birth Mother.txt,Monica,Why not?,56
S10E09 The Birth Mother.txt,Chandler,It's wrong. They made a mistake. They think we're somebody else.,56
S10E09 The Birth Mother.txt,Monica,God works in mysterious ways.,56
S10E09 The Birth Mother.txt,Chandler,You have gotta stop!,56
S10E09 The Birth Mother.txt,Monica,But she liked us.,56
S10E09 The Birth Mother.txt,Chandler,She likes Doctor Chandler and Reverend Monica.,56
S10E09 The Birth Mother.txt,Chandler,"Your Veal Chop is $34,95!",57
S10E09 The Birth Mother.txt,Monica,"C'mon Chandler, I think we have been given an opportunity. I mean, the mistake has already been made. They are writing up the paper right now.",57
S10E09 The Birth Mother.txt,Chandler,But we are not the one she chose! How can you feel okay about this?,57
S10E09 The Birth Mother.txt,Chandler,I know..,58
S10E09 The Birth Mother.txt,Monica,"I mean, who knows how long it's gonna take for someone else to give us a baby? What if, what if no one ever picks us?",58
S10E09 The Birth Mother.txt,Chandler,"oh, honey..",58
S10E09 The Birth Mother.txt,Chandler,"Monica, I want a baby too, but this woman is giving away her child. She deserves to know who it's going to.",59
S10E09 The Birth Mother.txt,Chandler,"So, we'll tell the truth and who knows, maybe she'll like us for us.",60
S10E09 The Birth Mother.txt,Chandler,You're Jewish.,61
S10E09 The Birth Mother.txt,Monica,Technicality!,61
S10E09 The Birth Mother.txt,Joey,"Oh, that looks great! Good ordering!",63
S10E09 The Birth Mother.txt,Waiter,Seafood platter for the gentleman and extra fries. Enjoy!,63
S10E09 The Birth Mother.txt,Sarah,"Mmmh, those fries look delicious.",63
S10E09 The Birth Mother.txt,Joey,"Uuuh.. yes, they are my stuffed clams.",65
S10E09 The Birth Mother.txt,Sarah,"Oh, that is so sweet..",69
S10E09 The Birth Mother.txt,Sarah,What? what is the matter with you?,72
S10E09 The Birth Mother.txt,Joey,"I don't like it when people take food off of my plate, okay?",72
S10E09 The Birth Mother.txt,Sarah,"But you just said ""What's mine is yours""?",72
S10E09 The Birth Mother.txt,Joey,"WELL, I DIDN'T MEAN IT!",72
S10E09 The Birth Mother.txt,Sarah,"Fine, I'm sorry, I didn't think it was that big a deal.",72
S10E09 The Birth Mother.txt,Girl,"Wow, this place looks great.",75
S10E09 The Birth Mother.txt,Joey,"I really am sorry about, you know..before. I just want to make sure you know that I really do like you.",79
S10E09 The Birth Mother.txt,Waiter,"Chocolate Torte for the lady, cheesecake for the gentleman.",82
S10E09 The Birth Mother.txt,Joey,"Uh, excuse me sir, there seems to be some sort of red crap on my cheesecake.",82
S10E09 The Birth Mother.txt,Waiter,"Yes, that's Raspberry coule.",82
S10E09 The Birth Mother.txt,Joey,"Oh, all right, I'll just have what she's having instead.",85
S10E09 The Birth Mother.txt,Waiter,"Oh, I'm sorry sir, that was our last piece.",85
S10E09 The Birth Mother.txt,Sarah,Mmmm! Mmm!,85
S10E09 The Birth Mother.txt,Sarah,"Oh, no! This is work. I should call in. Can you excuse me?",86
S10E09 The Birth Mother.txt,Joey,"Oh yeah, sure. No problem.",86
S10E09 The Birth Mother.txt,Sarah,What are you doing? I thought you don't share food.,87
S10E09 The Birth Mother.txt,Joey,"Why, just a tiny little...",95
S10E09 The Birth Mother.txt,Joey,Oh-oh!,96
S10E09 The Birth Mother.txt,Joey,I'm not even sorry.,97
S10E09 The Birth Mother.txt,Erica,Hi!,98
S10E09 The Birth Mother.txt,Chandler,Hey.,98
S10E09 The Birth Mother.txt,Monica,"Look, doctor!",100
S10E09 The Birth Mother.txt,Chandler,The agency must have made some mistake. My wife is not a reverend and I'm not a doctor.,101
S10E09 The Birth Mother.txt,Erica,What?,101
S10E09 The Birth Mother.txt,Chandler,I could perform an operation on you and prove it if you'd like.,101
S10E09 The Birth Mother.txt,Erica,So who are you?,101
S10E09 The Birth Mother.txt,Chandler,"Well, our names really are Monica and Chandler. We're from New York.",101
S10E09 The Birth Mother.txt,Erica,So you lied to me before?,102
S10E09 The Birth Mother.txt,Erica,I can't believe this.,103
S10E09 The Birth Mother.txt,Monica,But we were hoping that since we told you the truth that you still might consider...,103
S10E09 The Birth Mother.txt,Erica,Giving you my baby? You think I'd give you my child after this?,103
S10E09 The Birth Mother.txt,Monica,"Well, you don't have to decide right now, but if you could just look at our file...",103
S10E09 The Birth Mother.txt,Erica,I don't want to look at your file! This is over.,103
S10E09 The Birth Mother.txt,Chandler,Erica wait!,104
S10E09 The Birth Mother.txt,Chandler,You have every reason to be upset. We did lie. But only because we've been waiting and trying to have a baby for so long. Now we don't know how long it's gonna be before we can get another chance again.,105
S10E09 The Birth Mother.txt,Erica,Why don't you ask the reverend to pray on it?,105
S10E09 The Birth Mother.txt,Chandler,"Erica, please. Just consider us. Ask them to see our file. Our last name's Bing. My wife's a chef and I'm in advertising.",105
S10E09 The Birth Mother.txt,Chandler,"But you did like us. And you should. My wife's an incredible woman. She's loving and devoted and caring. And don't tell her I said this but the woman's always right... I love my wife more than anything in this world. And I... It kills me that I can't give her a baby... I really want a kid. And when that day finally comes, I'll learn how to be a good dad. But my wife... she's already there. She's a mother... without a baby... Please?",106
S10E09 The Birth Mother.txt,Chandler,You still want that baby?,107
S10E09 The Birth Mother.txt,Monica,God bless you Chandler Bing!,108
S10E09 The Birth Mother.txt,Ross,Turns out this sweater is made for a woman.,109
S10E09 The Birth Mother.txt,Ross,"Because it's soft... Hey, so how was your date?",110
S10E09 The Birth Mother.txt,Joey,Ooh... Not so good.,110
S10E09 The Birth Mother.txt,Ross,"Well, looks like it's just the two of us tonight, huh old buddy?",110
S10E09 The Birth Mother.txt,Joey,"Yeah, and you know what? We could do a lot worse.",110
S03E17 The Ski Trip.txt,Joey,Can I see the comics?,2
S03E17 The Ski Trip.txt,Chandler,This is the New York Times.,2
S03E17 The Ski Trip.txt,Joey,"Okay, may I see the comics?",2
S03E17 The Ski Trip.txt,Monica,Guys. I thought you were taking Ross to the game?,3
S03E17 The Ski Trip.txt,Chandler,We are. He’s meeting us here.,3
S03E17 The Ski Trip.txt,Monica,No! Rachel is meeting us here.,3
S03E17 The Ski Trip.txt,Phoebe,"Oh come on, they can be in the same room.",3
S03E17 The Ski Trip.txt,Joey,"Yeah, you shoulda been there last night.",3

S03E17 The Ski Trip.txt,Chandler,"Yeah y-you, how hard is it to say something? Rachel came over to borrow something.",3
S03E17 The Ski Trip.txt,Joey,Anyway! Her and Ross just started yelling at each other.,3
S03E17 The Ski Trip.txt,Phoebe,Wait. Why was he yelling at her? He’s the one who slept with someone else.,3
S03E17 The Ski Trip.txt,Joey,"Well, I guess he says that because they were on a break when it happened, that she should of forgiven him by now.",3
S03E17 The Ski Trip.txt,Phoebe,"Whoa!! He is soo unreasonable! God, although I think I understand what he means. Oh my God, this is like 60 Minutes, okay, when, when, at first you’re really mad at that pharmaceutical company for making the drug and then y'know you just feel bad for the people because they needed to make their hair grow.",3
S03E17 The Ski Trip.txt,Chandler,"Y'know what this is like? This is like when my parents got divorced. Man, I hope Ross doesn’t try to kidnap me after Cub Scouts.",3
S03E17 The Ski Trip.txt,Phoebe,"Y'know I had a dream where Ross and Rachel were still together, they never broke up. And we were all just like hanging out, and everyone was happy....",3
S03E17 The Ski Trip.txt,Joey,I had the same dream!,3
S03E17 The Ski Trip.txt,Phoebe,"Yeah, and nobody slept with that Xerox girl.",3
S03E17 The Ski Trip.txt,Joey,"Oh, I had the opposite dream.",3
S03E17 The Ski Trip.txt,Chandler,"Y'know what maybe it’s gonna be okay, I mean it’s been a week.",3
S03E17 The Ski Trip.txt,Joey,"Yeah, I mean it’s never taken me a week to get over a relationship.",3
S03E17 The Ski Trip.txt,Monica,It’s never taken you more than a shower to get over a relationship.,3
S03E17 The Ski Trip.txt,Rachel,Hey!,5
S03E17 The Ski Trip.txt,Monica,Let’s get the show on it!,5
S03E17 The Ski Trip.txt,Rachel,"Okay, let me just get a cup of coffee.",5

S03E17 The Ski Trip.txt,Rachel,"Oh, well okay. Well, there you go.",12

S03E17 The Ski Trip.txt,Rachel,Hm-mm.,12
S03E17 The Ski Trip.txt,Chandler,"Yeah, he’s really excited about it too, he even recorded show times on his answering machine.",12

S03E17 The Ski Trip.txt,Ross,"Yeah, that’s okay, I mean if you guys all have to go away for the first weekend I’m alone by myself, y'know then I totally, totally understand.",26
S03E17 The Ski Trip.txt,Phoebe,"Y'know what, I can stay, I’m gonna stay. ‘Cause the last time I went skiing I was to afraid to jump off the chair lift, I just went around and around.",26

S03E17 The Ski Trip.txt,Carol,It’s not that kind of anniversary.,51
S03E17 The Ski Trip.txt,Carol,Sooo!! Anyway...,52
S03E17 The Ski Trip.txt,Ross,"Umm, candles, champagne, yeah anniversaries are great. ‘Cause you know love lasts forever, y'know. Nothing like it in this lifetime, money in the bank, so Rachel and I broke up.",52
S03E17 The Ski Trip.txt,Carol,"Oh God, Ross I am so sorry.",52
S03E17 The Ski Trip.txt,Ross,"Yeah, well.",52
S03E17 The Ski Trip.txt,Carol,"Y'know what, I want to talk to you about this so much, but we should probably do it when we could really get into it, are you free for dinner tomorrow night?",52
S03E17 The Ski Trip.txt,Ross,"Oh yeah, I’d love that.",52

S03E17 The Ski Trip.txt,Rachel,"I don’t know, I’m sorry, I always slept in the back when we drove up here.",57
S03E17 The Ski Trip.txt,Rachel,"Ugh, okay, well somebody will come and save us.",58
S03E17 The Ski Trip.txt,Monica,"Who? I mean have you seen a car come by here in the last hour and a half? I think we should call Ross, maybe he can get a car and come pick us up.",58
S03E17 The Ski Trip.txt,Rachel,"No! No, I am not getting in a car with Ross, we will just have to live here!",58
S03E17 The Ski Trip.txt,Phoebe,But if...,58
S03E17 The Ski Trip.txt,Rachel,"No you guys, I am not getting in a car with him, you’ll have to think of something else.",58
S03E17 The Ski Trip.txt,Phoebe,"Oh good, oh Joey and Chandler are back.",58
S03E17 The Ski Trip.txt,Monica,So the going for help went well?,59
S03E17 The Ski Trip.txt,Joey,"Oh yeah, Smokey Joe here got half way to the highway and collapsed.",59
S03E17 The Ski Trip.txt,Monica,Then why are you smoking?,60
S03E17 The Ski Trip.txt,Chandler,Well it’s very unsettling.,60
S03E17 The Ski Trip.txt,Ross,"....right? Right? I mean it’s pretty unbelievable y'know, I mean they just took off, took off without even looking back. Y'know I don’t, I don’t need them, huh, I’ve got you guys now as friends, you and Susan.",61
S03E17 The Ski Trip.txt,Carol,"Ah, Susan will be so pleased.",61
S03E17 The Ski Trip.txt,Carol,"No. But it’s okay, I’ll just put out pickles or something.",63
S03E17 The Ski Trip.txt,Ross,"Pheebs? What, why are you whispering?",65
S03E17 The Ski Trip.txt,Phoebe,I ate a bug.,65
S03E17 The Ski Trip.txt,Phoebe,"Listen Ross, we ran out of gas, and we don’t know where we are, so we can’t get a tow truck.",67
S03E17 The Ski Trip.txt,Ross,"Oh, now you want a favour?",67
S03E17 The Ski Trip.txt,Phoebe,"Yes, please.",67
S03E17 The Ski Trip.txt,Ross,"Well, oh, I’m sorry your car broke down Pheebs, but I’m a little too busy with some of my real friends right now, but please call to let me know you got home safely okay?",67
S03E17 The Ski Trip.txt,Ross,"No, I’m not gonna pick them up.",68
S03E17 The Ski Trip.txt,Carol,"Listen, we both know you’re gonna do it ‘cause you’re not a jerk. Okay? So you can either sulk here for a half hour and then go pick them up, or save us both time and sulk in the car.",68
S03E17 The Ski Trip.txt,Ross,"No, Rachel doesn’t want me to....",68
S03E17 The Ski Trip.txt,Carol,"Look, I-I-I am sorry that Rachel dumped you ‘cause she fell in love with that Mark guy, and you are the innocent victim in all of this, but don’t punish your friends for what Rachel did to you.",68
S03E17 The Ski Trip.txt,Ross,"Yeah, you’re right.",68
S03E17 The Ski Trip.txt,Carol,You slept with another woman?,70
S03E17 The Ski Trip.txt,Ross,"Oh, you-you’re-you’re one to talk.",70
S03E17 The Ski Trip.txt,Joey,"Okay, done.",71
S03E17 The Ski Trip.txt,Joey,That’s ‘help’ spelled backwards so that the helicopters can read it from the air!,72
S03E17 The Ski Trip.txt,Monica,Huh. What’s doofus spelled backwards?,72
S03E17 The Ski Trip.txt,Phoebe,"Oh, it’s Ross on one of his drives!",74
S03E17 The Ski Trip.txt,Phoebe,Hi!,74
S03E17 The Ski Trip.txt,Rachel,What is he doing here?!,74
S03E17 The Ski Trip.txt,Ross,"He is saving your butt, ah, unless of course I’m stepping on some toes here, in which case I can just mosey on, I’ve got plenty of people to help on the Interstate.",74
S03E17 The Ski Trip.txt,All,No! Come on!,74

S03E17 The Ski Trip.txt,Chandler,"Oh, this is horrible, it’s just horrible.",76
S03E17 The Ski Trip.txt,Joey,"Guys, do you think we should ask Ross to come along?",76
S03E17 The Ski Trip.txt,Monica,"I know, what about Rachel? I mean how are we even gonna ask her?",76
S03E17 The Ski Trip.txt,Rachel,Ask me what?,76
S03E17 The Ski Trip.txt,Monica,"Umm, if ah, it might be okay if Ross came skiing?",76
S03E17 The Ski Trip.txt,Rachel,You guys are unbelievable. No! He cannot come.,76
S03E17 The Ski Trip.txt,Ross,Excuse me?,76
S03E17 The Ski Trip.txt,Chandler,It’s horrible.,76
S03E17 The Ski Trip.txt,Rachel,Why would you even want to come Ross? You’re a horrible skier.,77
S03E17 The Ski Trip.txt,Ross,"Oh-oh, hitting me where it hurts, my ski skills.",77
S03E17 The Ski Trip.txt,Monica,Here we go again.,77
S03E17 The Ski Trip.txt,Joey,"I-I can’t handle this, you guys.",77
S03E17 The Ski Trip.txt,Chandler,"Y'know what, I can handle it, handle’s my middle name. Actually it’s the ah, middle part of my first name.",77
S03E17 The Ski Trip.txt,Ross,"All right Pheebs, your cab’s ready.",77
S03E17 The Ski Trip.txt,Rachel,"All right, let’s go!",77
S03E17 The Ski Trip.txt,Ross,You’re welcome.,77
S03E17 The Ski Trip.txt,Rachel,"Oh, I’m sorry, were you speaking to me or sleeping with someone else?",77
S03E17 The Ski Trip.txt,Ross,We were on a break!,77
S03E17 The Ski Trip.txt,Rachel,Y'know Ross why don’t you put that on your answering machine!,77
S03E17 The Ski Trip.txt,Ross,"Hey-hey, it’s valid okay? And I’m not the only one who thinks so, Monica agrees with me.",77
S03E17 The Ski Trip.txt,Ross,That’s what you said last night.,79
S03E17 The Ski Trip.txt,Monica,"What I said was, was that I understood. Joey’s the one who agreed with you!",79
S03E17 The Ski Trip.txt,Ross,Okay.,79
S03E17 The Ski Trip.txt,Rachel,Really Joey?,79
S03E17 The Ski Trip.txt,Phoebe,"Y'know what, but there is, there is no right or wrong, here.",80
S03E17 The Ski Trip.txt,Rachel,"No, I think it’s very obvious who’s wrong here.",80
S03E17 The Ski Trip.txt,Ross,Obviously not to Joey.,80
S03E17 The Ski Trip.txt,Joey,"Yeah, and not put us in the middle.",87
S03E17 The Ski Trip.txt,Rachel,Yeah.,88
S03E17 The Ski Trip.txt,Ross,I can.,88
S03E17 The Ski Trip.txt,Phoebe,"Okay. Good, all right, let’s get back in the car, ‘cause it’s freezing, and my chest is unsupported.",88
S03E17 The Ski Trip.txt,Joey,"Oh what, wait, wait a second, I mean, what are we doing? Who’s going with who?",88
S03E17 The Ski Trip.txt,Joey,"Come on man, you drove all the way up here.",89
S03E17 The Ski Trip.txt,Ross,"No, no, really, I’ve got to take the car back anyway, I’m spending all day tomorrow with Ben, It’s fine, no guilt I promise.",89
S03E17 The Ski Trip.txt,Rachel,Thank you.,89
S03E17 The Ski Trip.txt,Monica,"All right, we’ll call you when we get back.",89
S03E17 The Ski Trip.txt,Ross,Okay.,89

S03E17 The Ski Trip.txt,Ross,"Oh, great! Listen, oh I had to get you a whole new battery. I got you the best one I could, ‘cause that’s not where you want to skimp.",94
S03E17 The Ski Trip.txt,Carol,"You’re a genius, Ross.",94
S03E17 The Ski Trip.txt,Ross,"Yeah, well it came to about $112, but what the hell, just call it an even 110?",94

S03E17 The Ski Trip.txt,Carol,"Okay, bye!!",95
S03E17 The Ski Trip.txt,Ross,"So they ah, they all took off, it was pretty hard watching them go, y'know?",95
S01E03 The Thumb.txt,All,"Hey, Pheebs! Hi!",3
S01E03 The Thumb.txt,Ross,"Hey. Oh, oh, how'd it go?",3
S01E03 The Thumb.txt,Phoebe,"Um, not so good. He walked me to the subway and said 'We should do this again!'",3
S01E03 The Thumb.txt,All,Ohh. Ouch.,3
S01E03 The Thumb.txt,Rachel,"What? He said 'we should do it again', that's good, right?",3
S01E03 The Thumb.txt,Monica,"Uh, no. Loosely translated 'We should do this again' means 'You will never see me naked'.",3
S01E03 The Thumb.txt,Rachel,Since when?,3
S01E03 The Thumb.txt,Joey,"Since always. It's like dating language. Y'know, like 'It's not you' means 'It is you'.",3
S01E03 The Thumb.txt,Chandler,Or 'You're such a nice guy' means 'I'm gonna be dating leather-wearing alcoholics and complaining about them to you'.,3
S01E03 The Thumb.txt,Phoebe,"Or, or, y'know, um, 'I think we should see other people' means 'Ha, ha, I already am'.",3
S01E03 The Thumb.txt,Rachel,And everybody knows this?,3
S01E03 The Thumb.txt,Joey,Yeah. Cushions the blow.,3
S01E03 The Thumb.txt,Chandler,"Yeah, it's like when you're a kid, and your parents put your dog to sleep, and they tell you it went off to live on some farm.",3
S01E03 The Thumb.txt,Ross,"That's funny, that, no, because, uh, our parents actually did, uh, send our dog off to live on a farm.",3
S01E03 The Thumb.txt,Monica,"Uh, Ross.",3
S01E03 The Thumb.txt,Ross,"What? Wh- hello? The Millners' farm in Connecticut? The Millners, they had this unbelievable farm, they had horses, and, and rabbits that he could chase and it was- it w- .....Oh my God, Chi Chi!",3
S01E03 The Thumb.txt,Chandler,"""So how does it feel knowing you're about to die?""",4
S01E03 The Thumb.txt,Joey,"""Warden, in five minutes my pain will be over. But you'll have to live with the knowledge that you sent an honest man to die.""",4
S01E03 The Thumb.txt,Chandler,"Hey, that was really good!",4
S01E03 The Thumb.txt,Joey,Thanks! Let's keep going.,4
S01E03 The Thumb.txt,Chandler,"Okay. ""So. Whaddya want from me, Damone, huh?""",4
S01E03 The Thumb.txt,Joey,"""I just wanna go back to my cell. 'Cause in my cell, I can smoke.""",4
S01E03 The Thumb.txt,Chandler,"""Smoke away.""",4
S01E03 The Thumb.txt,Chandler,I think this is probably why Damone smokes in his cell alone.,5
S01E03 The Thumb.txt,Joey,What?,5
S01E03 The Thumb.txt,Chandler,Relax your hand!,5
S01E03 The Thumb.txt,Chandler,Not so much!,6
S01E03 The Thumb.txt,Joey,Whoah!,6
S01E03 The Thumb.txt,Chandler,Hey!,6
S01E03 The Thumb.txt,Joey,Hey!,6
S01E03 The Thumb.txt,Chandler,"Alright, now try taking a puff.",6
S01E03 The Thumb.txt,Chandler,Alright.. okay. No. Give it to me.,7
S01E03 The Thumb.txt,Joey,"No no no, I am not giving you a cigarette.",7
S01E03 The Thumb.txt,Chandler,"It's fine, it's fine. Look, do you wanna get this part, or not? Here.",7
S01E03 The Thumb.txt,Chandler,"Don't think of it as a cigarette. Think of it as the thing that's been missing from your hand. When you're holding it, you feel right. You feel complete.",8
S01E03 The Thumb.txt,Joey,Y'miss it?,8
S01E03 The Thumb.txt,Monica,"No, no, no. They say it's the same as the distance from the tip of a guy's thumb to the tip of his index finger.",10
S01E03 The Thumb.txt,Joey,That's ridiculous!,11
S01E03 The Thumb.txt,Ross,Can I use.. either thumb?,11
S01E03 The Thumb.txt,All,"Yeah. Yeah, excellent.",12
S01E03 The Thumb.txt,Joey,"Y'okay, Phoebe?",14
S01E03 The Thumb.txt,Phoebe,"Yeah- no- I'm just- it's, I haven't worked- It's my bank.",14
S01E03 The Thumb.txt,Monica,What did they do to you?,14
S01E03 The Thumb.txt,Phoebe,"It's nothing, it's just- Okay. I'm going through my mail, and I open up their monthly, you know, STATEMENT-",14
S01E03 The Thumb.txt,Ross,Easy.,14
S01E03 The Thumb.txt,Phoebe,- and there's five hundred extra dollars in my account.,14
S01E03 The Thumb.txt,Chandler,"Oh, Satan's minions at work again...",14
S01E03 The Thumb.txt,Phoebe,"Yes, 'cause now I have to go down there, and deal with them.",14
S01E03 The Thumb.txt,Joey,What are you talking about? Keep it!,14
S01E03 The Thumb.txt,Phoebe,"It's not mine, I didn't earn it, if I kept it, it would be like stealing.",14
S01E03 The Thumb.txt,Rachel,"Yeah, but if you spent it, it would be like shopping!",14
S01E03 The Thumb.txt,Phoebe,"Okay. Okay, let's say I bought a really great pair of shoes. Do you know what I'd hear, with every step I took? 'Not-mine. Not-mine. Not-mine.' And even if I was happy, okay, and, and skipping- 'Not-not-mine, not-not-mine, not-not-mine, not-not-mine'...",14
S01E03 The Thumb.txt,Monica,We're with you. We got it.,14
S01E03 The Thumb.txt,Phoebe,Okay. I'd- just- I'd never be able to enjoy it. It would be like this giant karmic debt.,15
S01E03 The Thumb.txt,Rachel,"Chandler, what are you doing?",15
S01E03 The Thumb.txt,All,"Oh! Oh, God!",17
S01E03 The Thumb.txt,Ross,What is this?!,17
S01E03 The Thumb.txt,Chandler,"I'm smoking. I'm smoking, I'm smoking.",17
S01E03 The Thumb.txt,Phoebe,"Oh, I can't believe you! You've been so good, for three years!",17
S01E03 The Thumb.txt,Chandler,And this- is my reward!,17
S01E03 The Thumb.txt,Ross,"Hold on a second, alright? Just think about what you went through the last time you quit.",17
S01E03 The Thumb.txt,Chandler,"Okay, so this time I won't quit!",17
S01E03 The Thumb.txt,All,Ohhh! Put it out!,17
S01E03 The Thumb.txt,Phoebe,"Oh, no! I- I can't drink this now!",18
S01E03 The Thumb.txt,Monica,"Alright. I'm gonna go change, I've got a date.",18
S01E03 The Thumb.txt,Rachel,This Alan again? How's it goin'?,18
S01E03 The Thumb.txt,Monica,"'S'going pretty good, y'know? It's nice, and, we're having fun.",18
S01E03 The Thumb.txt,Joey,So when do we get to meet the guy?,18
S01E03 The Thumb.txt,Monica,"Let's see, today's Monday... Never.",18
S01E03 The Thumb.txt,All,"Oh, come on! Come on!",18
S01E03 The Thumb.txt,Monica,No. Not after what happened with Steve.,18
S01E03 The Thumb.txt,Chandler,What are you talking about? We love Schhteve! Schhteve was schhexy!.. Sorry.,18
S01E03 The Thumb.txt,Monica,"Look, I don't even know how I feel about him yet. Just give me a chance to figure that out.",18
S01E03 The Thumb.txt,Rachel,"Well, then can we meet him?",18
S01E03 The Thumb.txt,Monica,Nope. Schhorry.,18
S01E03 The Thumb.txt,Monica,"I mean, why should I let them meet him? I mean, I bring a guy home, and within five minutes they're all over him. I mean, they're like- coyotes, picking off the weak members of the herd.",19
S01E03 The Thumb.txt,Paula,"Listen. As someone who's seen more than her fair share of bad beef, I'll tell you: that is not such a terrible thing. I mean, they're your friends, they're just looking out after you.",19
S01E03 The Thumb.txt,Monica,"I know. I just wish that once, I'd bring a guy home that they actually liked.",19
S01E03 The Thumb.txt,Paula,"Well, you do realise the odds of that happening are a little slimmer if they never get to meet the guy..",19
S01E03 The Thumb.txt,Joey,"Let it go, Ross.",20
S01E03 The Thumb.txt,Ross,"Yeah, well, you didn't know Chi Chi.",20
S01E03 The Thumb.txt,Monica,Do you all promise?,20
S01E03 The Thumb.txt,All,Yeah! We promise! We'll be good!,20
S01E03 The Thumb.txt,Joey,"You can come in, but your filter-tipped little buddy has to stay outside!",22
S01E03 The Thumb.txt,Ross,"Hey, Pheebs.",24
S01E03 The Thumb.txt,Rachel,What bank is this?,25
S01E03 The Thumb.txt,Monica,"Hi. Alan, this is everybody. Everybody, this is Alan.",32

S01E03 The Thumb.txt,Ross,"...I'll go. Let's start with the way he kept picking at- no, I'm sorry, I can't do this, can't do this. We loved him.",36
S01E03 The Thumb.txt,All,Loved him! Yeah! He's great!,36
S01E03 The Thumb.txt,Monica,Wait a minute! We're talking about someone that I'm going out with?,36
S01E03 The Thumb.txt,All,Yeah!,36
S01E03 The Thumb.txt,Joey,Know what was great? The way his smile was kinda crooked.,38
S01E03 The Thumb.txt,Phoebe,"Yes, yes! Like the man in the shoe!",38
S01E03 The Thumb.txt,Ross,...What shoe?,38
S01E03 The Thumb.txt,Phoebe,"From the nursery rhyme. 'There was a crooked man, Who had a crooked smile, Who lived in a shoe, For a... while...'",38
S01E03 The Thumb.txt,Ross,...So I think Alan will become the yardstick against which all future boyfriends will be measured.,39
S01E03 The Thumb.txt,Rachel,"What future boyfriends? Nono, I th- I think this could be, y'know, it.",39
S01E03 The Thumb.txt,Monica,Really!,39
S01E03 The Thumb.txt,Ross,"You know what I like most about him, though?",40
S01E03 The Thumb.txt,All,What?,40
S01E03 The Thumb.txt,Ross,The way he makes me feel about myself.,40
S01E03 The Thumb.txt,All,Yeah...,40

S01E03 The Thumb.txt,Monica,Fantastic! I have one question: How is that possible?,41
S01E03 The Thumb.txt,Joey,Alan.,41
S01E03 The Thumb.txt,Ross,"He was unbelievable. He was like that-that-that Bugs Bunny cartoon where Bugs is playing all the positions, right, but instead of Bugs it was first base-Alan, second base-Alan, third base-...",41
S01E03 The Thumb.txt,Rachel,"I mean, it-it was like, it was like he made us into a team.",41
S01E03 The Thumb.txt,Chandler,"Yep, we sure showed those Hassidic jewellers a thing or two about softball..",41
S01E03 The Thumb.txt,Monica,Can I ask you guys a question? D'you ever think that Alan is maybe.. sometimes..,41
S01E03 The Thumb.txt,Ross,What?,41
S01E03 The Thumb.txt,Monica,"..I dunno, a little too Alan?",41
S01E03 The Thumb.txt,Rachel,"Well, no. That's impossible. You can never be too Alan.",41
S01E03 The Thumb.txt,Ross,"Yeah, it's his, uh, innate Alan-ness that-that-that we adore.",41
S01E03 The Thumb.txt,Chandler,I personally could have a gallon of Alan.,41
S01E03 The Thumb.txt,Phoebe,"Hey, Lizzie.",42
S01E03 The Thumb.txt,Lizzie,"Hey, Weird Girl.",42
S01E03 The Thumb.txt,Phoebe,I brought you alphabet soup.,42
S01E03 The Thumb.txt,Lizzie,Did you pick out the vowels?,42
S01E03 The Thumb.txt,Lizzie,Saltines?,43
S01E03 The Thumb.txt,Phoebe,"No, but would you like a thousand dollars and a football phone?",43
S01E03 The Thumb.txt,Phoebe,I know.,44
S01E03 The Thumb.txt,Lizzie,"Weird Girl, what are you doing?",44
S01E03 The Thumb.txt,Phoebe,"No, I want you to have it. I don't want it.",44
S01E03 The Thumb.txt,Lizzie,"No, no, I ha-I have to give you something.",44
S01E03 The Thumb.txt,Phoebe,"Oh, that's fine, no.",44
S01E03 The Thumb.txt,Lizzie,Would you like my tin-foil hat?,44
S01E03 The Thumb.txt,Phoebe,"No. 'Cause you need that. No, it's okay, thanks.",44
S01E03 The Thumb.txt,Lizzie,"Please, let me do something.",44
S01E03 The Thumb.txt,Phoebe,"Okay, alright, you buy me a soda, and then we're even. Okay?",44
S01E03 The Thumb.txt,Lizzie,Okay.,44
S01E03 The Thumb.txt,Phoebe,Okay.,44
S01E03 The Thumb.txt,Phoebe,"No, I'm fine.",47
S01E03 The Thumb.txt,Phoebe,Huh!,49
S01E03 The Thumb.txt,Ross,A thumb?!,50
S01E03 The Thumb.txt,All,Eww!,51
S01E03 The Thumb.txt,Phoebe,"I know! I know, I opened it up and there it was, just floating in there, like this tiny little hitch-hiker!",51
S01E03 The Thumb.txt,Chandler,"Well, maybe it's a contest, y'know? Like, collect all five?",51
S01E03 The Thumb.txt,Phoebe,"Does, um, anyone wanna see?",51
S01E03 The Thumb.txt,All,Nooo!,51
S01E03 The Thumb.txt,All,"Oh, hey, don't do that! Cut it out!",52
S01E03 The Thumb.txt,Rachel,It's worse than the thumb!,52
S01E03 The Thumb.txt,Chandler,"Hey, this is so unfair!",52
S01E03 The Thumb.txt,Monica,"Oh, why is it unfair?",52

S08E17 The Tea Leaves.txt,Chandler,I didn’t know you read tea leaves.,14
S08E17 The Tea Leaves.txt,Phoebe,"Oh yeah, I’ve done it for years. I actually stopped because I was so accurate. Y’know, and-and y’know, one of the great joys of life is it’s-it’s wondrous unpredictability. Y’know? And also tea tends to give me the trots.",14

S08E17 The Tea Leaves.txt,Chandler,"I know it’s tough now, but things will get better.",27
S08E17 The Tea Leaves.txt,Rachel,"How do you know that? What if it just gets worse and worse and worse, to the point where we can’t even be in the same room with each other?!",27
S08E17 The Tea Leaves.txt,Chandler,"I’m not great at the advice, can I interest you in a sarcastic comment? Some cheese?",27

S08E17 The Tea Leaves.txt,Monica,"Okay. No need to panic. Deep breathes everyone. Okay umm uh, we’re just gonna have to spend some time and put the CDs in the right cases.",27
S08E17 The Tea Leaves.txt,Chandler,"Well, if we’re gonna do that we should come up with some kind of order. Y’know alphabetically or by genre?",27
S08E17 The Tea Leaves.txt,Monica,"Hmm, I don’t know. We really have to talk this through.",27
S08E17 The Tea Leaves.txt,Rachel,Oh my God!! You guys have such problems!! I feel so terrible for you!,27
S08E17 The Tea Leaves.txt,Monica,"Okay, I-I’m sorry. You and Joey, your both focusing on this uncomfortable thing, what you need to do is to change the subject. Next time you see him try to get him talking about something else.",27
S08E17 The Tea Leaves.txt,Rachel,Oh yeah. That makes sense.,27
S08E17 The Tea Leaves.txt,Monica,"Yeah, like I don’t know, maybe you have a work problem that you need his advice on.",27

S08E17 The Tea Leaves.txt,Joey,"Okay, how did this even happen?",32
S08E17 The Tea Leaves.txt,Joey,Man! When you said it was a problem about your boss and the baby I figured it was something about maternity leave.,33

S08E17 The Tea Leaves.txt,Joey,Do you think you can just buy my friends baby?!,44

S08E17 The Tea Leaves.txt,Phoebe,"Okay. Umm look, you’re coming on a little strong. But I’m going to give you the benefit of the doubt, because it seems the universe really wants to be together. So, why don’t we just start over okay? And you can just tell me about yourself.",46
S08E17 The Tea Leaves.txt,Jim,All right.,46
S08E17 The Tea Leaves.txt,Phoebe,Okay.,46

S08E17 The Tea Leaves.txt,Joey,So? What-what-what happened?,70
S08E17 The Tea Leaves.txt,Rachel,It’s all gonna be okay. They’re just so happy that I’m not suing them that they gave me one extra month paid maternity leave. So long as I understand that the money should not construed as a down payment on this or any other child I should bear.,70
S08E17 The Tea Leaves.txt,Chandler,"Wow, Ralph Lauren is really going out of there way to show they’re not in the baby buying business.",70

S02E18 Dr. Ramoray Dies.txt,Chandler,"Ya know Phoebs, don't feel so bad for 'em. After they're done playing, I break out the little plastic women and everybody has a pretty good time.",5
S02E18 Dr. Ramoray Dies.txt,Phoebe,Why don't you play with your roommate?,5
S02E18 Dr. Ramoray Dies.txt,Chandler,"Ah he's a, he's not a big fan of foosball.",5

S02E18 Dr. Ramoray Dies.txt,Chandler,"No he's, he's alright, just uh, he spends most of his time in his room.",5
S02E18 Dr. Ramoray Dies.txt,Phoebe,"Maybe that's because you haven't taken the time to get to know him. Let's remedy that, shall we?",5
S02E18 Dr. Ramoray Dies.txt,Chandler,We don't need to remedy that.,5
S02E18 Dr. Ramoray Dies.txt,Eddie,What was that?,6

S02E18 Dr. Ramoray Dies.txt,Chandler,Well it's not Sean Penn.,8

S02E18 Dr. Ramoray Dies.txt,Ross,Really?,19
S02E18 Dr. Ramoray Dies.txt,Rachel,"Oh please. That Paolo thing was barely a relationship. All it really was was just, ya know, meaningless animal sex. Ok, ya know, that sounded soooo much better in my head.",19
S02E18 Dr. Ramoray Dies.txt,Chandler,"Eddie, I didn't sleep with your ex-girlfriend.",20
S02E18 Dr. Ramoray Dies.txt,Eddie,"That's very interesting, ya know, 'cause that's exactly what someone who slept with her would say.",20

S02E18 Dr. Ramoray Dies.txt,Chandler,There was no fish when she dropped it off.,20
S02E18 Dr. Ramoray Dies.txt,Eddie,"Oh, this is, this is unbelievable. I mean, first you sleep with my ex-girlfriend then you insult my inteligenct by lying about it and then you kill my fish, my Buddy?",20
S02E18 Dr. Ramoray Dies.txt,Richard,That's it? That's the giant number you were afraid to tell me?,22

S02E18 Dr. Ramoray Dies.txt,Monica,"And, well, don't you have a lot of wild oats to sew? Or is that what you're doing with me? Oh my God, am I an oat?",22
S02E18 Dr. Ramoray Dies.txt,Richard,"Honey, you are not an oat. I, I mean I don't know, I, I guess I'm just not an oat guy. I've only slept with women I've been in love with.",22

S02E18 Dr. Ramoray Dies.txt,Ross,"Oh, hey, if I make you laugh, here's an idea, why don't you invite Paulo over and have a little romp in the sack and I'll just stand in the corner and tell knock-knock jokes.",24
S02E18 Dr. Ramoray Dies.txt,Rachel,"God, Ross, look, what you and I have is special, all Paolo and I ever had was...",24
S02E18 Dr. Ramoray Dies.txt,Ross,"Animal sex, animal sex? So what're you saying, I mean, you're saying that like, there's nothing between us animal at all. I mean there's not even like, uhm, a little animal, not even, not even like, like chipmunk sex?",24

S02E18 Dr. Ramoray Dies.txt,Chandler,It's gonna be ok. You know that?,37
S02E18 Dr. Ramoray Dies.txt,Joey,"No, I don't. It's like, ya know, you work your whole life for somethin' and you think that when you get it it's never gonna be as good as you thought it would be. But this so was. Ya know, it changed everything. Like the other day, I got this credit card application, and I was pre- approved. Huh? I've never been pre-approved for anything in my life.",37
S02E18 Dr. Ramoray Dies.txt,Chandler,I'm sorry man.,37

S02E10 Russ.txt,Joey,"Monica, have you ever been with him when he wasn't drinking?",17
S02E10 Russ.txt,Mnca,"Well, we just happen to go to alot of places where you might drink. I mean, how do you go to a wine tasting without having a drink? Or... or to a club, or to the... zoo.",17

S02E10 Russ.txt,Fbob,"OK, look, this isn't the first time somebody's said something to me about this, but, I don't know... I always made excuses about it, like... uhhh... 'I'm just a social drinker,' or, 'C'mon, it's Flag Day.'",22

S02E10 Russ.txt,Estl,"Oh, isn't Lori a doll?",34
S02E10 Russ.txt,Joey,"Oh yeah, yeah, she's great, but... I kinda got the feeling that she was sort of... coming on to me. And I definitely would get the part if I would've... you know... if I would have sent the Little General in.",34

S02E10 Russ.txt,Phoe,"OK, OK, don't get all squinky.",39
S02E10 Russ.txt,Rach,Maybe it was just the kind of story where you have to be there.,39
S02E10 Russ.txt,Mnca,"But I'm gonna be there... for the rest of my life. I mean, I can't break up with him. I'm the one who made him quit drinking. He's dull because of me.",39
S02E10 Russ.txt,Phoe,"Alright, don't say that. He's probably always been dull. You just, you know, set it free.",39
S02E10 Russ.txt,Russ,Hi.,40

S02E10 Russ.txt,Joey,"I just... I just don't think that I want it that way though, y'know? I mean, let's say I do make it, alright? I'm always gonna look back and wonder if it was because of my talent or because of.. y'know, the Little General.",53

S05E14 Everybody Finds Out.txt,Phoebe,"Or, we could not tell them we know and have a little fun of our own.",18
S05E14 Everybody Finds Out.txt,Rachel,Wh-what do you mean?,18

S05E14 Everybody Finds Out.txt,Chandler,What's going on?,25
S05E14 Everybody Finds Out.txt,Phoebe,"I think it's just y'know that I haven't been with a guy in so long and how sometimes you're looking for something and you just don’t even see that it's right there in front of you sipping coffee—Oh no, have I said to much? Well it's just something to think about. I know I will.",25

S05E14 Everybody Finds Out.txt,Chandler,I'm telling you I think Phoebe thinks I'm foxy.,27
S05E14 Everybody Finds Out.txt,Monica,That's not possible!,27

S05E14 Everybody Finds Out.txt,Rachel,Oh.,31
S05E14 Everybody Finds Out.txt,Ross,"No-no, I got the edge. I know it's not exactly ethical but I sent him a little bribe to",31
S05E14 Everybody Finds Out.txt,Monica,"Oh, is it that pinball machine with the big bow on it?",32
S05E14 Everybody Finds Out.txt,Ross,No.,32
S05E14 Everybody Finds Out.txt,Chandler,That new mountain bike?,32

S05E14 Everybody Finds Out.txt,Ross,The small one.,32
S05E14 Everybody Finds Out.txt,Rachel,What?! You-you actually thought that basket was gonna get you the apartment?,32

S05E14 Everybody Finds Out.txt,Monica,"Ohhh, oh my God! Oh my God! She knows about us!",35
S05E14 Everybody Finds Out.txt,Chandler,Are you serious?,35
S05E14 Everybody Finds Out.txt,Monica,Phoebe knows and she's just trying to freak us out! That's the only explanation for it!,35
S05E14 Everybody Finds Out.txt,Joey,Yeah?,39
S05E14 Everybody Finds Out.txt,Chandler,Phoebe knows about us!,39
S05E14 Everybody Finds Out.txt,Joey,Well I didn't tell them!,39

S05E14 Everybody Finds Out.txt,Chandler,Oh man!,39
S05E14 Everybody Finds Out.txt,Joey,"I'm sorry! But hey, it's over now, right? Because you can tell them that you know they know and I can go back to knowing absolutely nothing!",39
S05E14 Everybody Finds Out.txt,Monica,Unless…,39
S05E14 Everybody Finds Out.txt,Joey,No! Not unless! Look this must end now!,39
S05E14 Everybody Finds Out.txt,Monica,"Oh man, they think they are so slick messing with us! But see they don't know that we know that they know! So…",39
S05E14 Everybody Finds Out.txt,Chandler,"Ahh yes, the messers become the messies!",39

S05E14 Everybody Finds Out.txt,Rachel,"Oh Ross, honey you gotta stop torturing yourself!",40
S05E14 Everybody Finds Out.txt,Phoebe,"Yeah, why don't you just find another apartment?",40
S05E14 Everybody Finds Out.txt,Ross,Look I've already looked at like a thousand apartments this month and none of them even compares to that one!,40
S05E14 Everybody Finds Out.txt,Rachel,Y'know what you should do?,40
S05E14 Everybody Finds Out.txt,Ross,Huh?,40
S05E14 Everybody Finds Out.txt,Rachel,"You should find out what his hobbies are and then use that to bond with him. Yeah! Like if I would strike up a conversation about say umm, sandwiches. Or uh, or my underwear.",40
S05E14 Everybody Finds Out.txt,Joey,I'm listening.,40
S05E14 Everybody Finds Out.txt,Ross,"That is a great idea! And! I know Ugly Naked Guy because we've been watching him for like five years so that gives me back my edge! Oh, let's see now he had the trampoline.",41
S05E14 Everybody Finds Out.txt,Phoebe,He broke that.,41

S08E20 The Baby Shower.txt,Monica,"That’s right. That is right, you go over there and tell her you don’t want her to live with you. Do not take no for an answer!",32

S08E20 The Baby Shower.txt,Rachel,"So umm, you’re gonna stay with me as long as I need you?",51
S08E20 The Baby Shower.txt,Rachel,"Oh mom, I swear I’m not an idiot. I’ve read all kinds of books on pregnancy and giving birth, but I-I just didn’t think to read the part about what to do when the baby comes. And-and then guess what? The baby’s coming and I don’t know what to do. Oh, can I throw up in my diaper genie?",51
S08E20 The Baby Shower.txt,Rachel,Wait-wait where are you going? Where are you going?,52

S08E20 The Baby Shower.txt,Ross,"What—You’re not serious. I mean she’s a very nice woman, but there is no way we can take eight weeks of her. She’ll drive us totally crazy.",58
S08E20 The Baby Shower.txt,Man,"Hey Joey, hi! I’m Ray; I’m the producer of the show.",61

S08E20 The Baby Shower.txt,Joey,"Correct! Now, would you like to pick a Wicked Wango card or spin the Wheel of Mayhem?",65
S08E20 The Baby Shower.txt,Ray,"Uh Joey, didn’t your agents give you the revised rules? We’ve eliminated all of that. No wheel, no cards.",65
S08E20 The Baby Shower.txt,Joey,What—Why?!,65
S08E20 The Baby Shower.txt,Ray,"Uh well, the game was too complicated and research showed people didn’t follow it.",65
S08E20 The Baby Shower.txt,Joey,Well what’s complicated? You spin the Wheel of Mayhem to go up the Ladder of Chance. You go past the Mud Hut through the Rainbow Ring to get to the Golden Monkey; you yank his tail and boom! You’re in Paradise Pond!,65
S08E20 The Baby Shower.txt,Ray,Yeah all that’s gone. It’s basically just a simple question and answer game now.,65
S08E20 The Baby Shower.txt,Joey,Well what’s fun about that? You expect me to be the host of a boring game that’s just people standing around answering questions?,65
S08E20 The Baby Shower.txt,Ray,"Well, there’ll be women in bikinis holding up the scores.",65
S08E20 The Baby Shower.txt,Ross,Well we…we don’t have a garage.,67

S08E20 The Baby Shower.txt,Rachel,I do. I really do. I don’t know anything.,67
S08E20 The Baby Shower.txt,Ross,I’m-I’m sure that’s not true.,67
S08E20 The Baby Shower.txt,Rachel,Oh no? Pheebs? Monica? Do I know anything about babies?,67
S08E20 The Baby Shower.txt,Phoebe,"No, not a thing.",67
S08E20 The Baby Shower.txt,Monica,It’s frightening.,67
S08E20 The Baby Shower.txt,Ross,"Well uh, y’know what? Even if she doesn’t know anything, I do! I have a son. And his mother and I didn’t live together, and whenever he was with me I took care of him all the time, by myself.",67
S08E20 The Baby Shower.txt,Ross,Yeah.,67
S08E20 The Baby Shower.txt,Ross,"That’s a different issue. Uh, the point is, when the baby comes I will be there to…to feed her and bathe her and change her. And more than that I want to do all those things.",67
S08E20 The Baby Shower.txt,Ross,"Yes! Yes, you’re gonna be so missed.",67
S08E20 The Baby Shower.txt,Rachel,Hello?! I still don’t know what the hell I’m doing!,68

S08E20 The Baby Shower.txt,Rachel,Really?,69
S08E20 The Baby Shower.txt,Ross,I’m telling you.,69
S08E20 The Baby Shower.txt,Phoebe,"Nothing! You have apologized to her like a million times and she’s been nothing but terrible to you. And don’t forget you just threw her daughter a lovely, albeit slightly boring, shower, and she hasn’t even thanked you for it.",72
S08E20 The Baby Shower.txt,Monica,Y’know what? You’re-you’re right.,72
S08E20 The Baby Shower.txt,Phoebe,"Yeah I mean if you want to say anything to her, I’d tell her off.",72
S08E20 The Baby Shower.txt,Monica,Really?,72
S08E20 The Baby Shower.txt,Phoebe,Uh-huh!,72
S08E20 The Baby Shower.txt,Monica,That’s right! Maybe it’s time you took a good hard look at a mirror young lady…old lady…lady!,73
S08E20 The Baby Shower.txt,Phoebe,You were fantastic! I’m so proud of you!,75
S08E20 The Baby Shower.txt,Monica,Yeah? I’m proud of me too.,75

S08E20 The Baby Shower.txt,Rachel,"Check if it’s wet, check if it’s hungry, burp it!",80
S08E20 The Baby Shower.txt,Ross,"Excellent! Excellent, now-now do you want another question or a Wicked Wango card?",80

S10E11 The Stripper Cries.txt,Ross,"Okay, after you told me she was passed out in our room, I went in there to make sure she was all right. She was lying on my bed, all buried in peoples coats. Well, I went to kiss her on the forehead, you know. But it was so dark, I accidentally got her lips. I started to pull away, but then I felt her start to kiss me back. It was only for a second, but... it was amazing. And now, now I find out that you kissed her first.",118

S09E16 The Boob Job.txt,Monica,I know...God. I haven't seen my savings take a hit like this since I was a kid and they came up with double-stuffed Oreos. What happened to all our money?,2
S09E16 The Boob Job.txt,Chandler,"I'm not sure what they did, but I'm inclined to blame Enron.",2

S09E16 The Boob Job.txt,Monica,"Oh, But you're finally doing something that you love! I can't ask you to give that up. Though it'd be nice if the thing that you love was y'know... finding gold.",2
S09E16 The Boob Job.txt,Chandler,You know what? You know what? I think we're making too big a deal out of this. ok? So we pay our bills a little late this month and maybe next month we cut back on a few things. And maybe we start eating out of Joey's refrigerator for a change. You're chef... what can you make out of backing soda and beer?,2
S09E16 The Boob Job.txt,Monica,Ok worse case scenario is...we borrow some money from my parents.,2
S09E16 The Boob Job.txt,Chandler,No! We're not borrowing money.,2
S09E16 The Boob Job.txt,Monica,Why not?,2
S09E16 The Boob Job.txt,Chandler,Because we don't do that. We are Bings! And if there's one thing my father taught me was... well to always knock before going into the pool house... but the other thing was never borrow money.,2
S09E16 The Boob Job.txt,Monica,Wow! I Had no idea you had this much pride.,2
S09E16 The Boob Job.txt,Chandler,That's right! I do! And I'm your man. And I'm going to get us through this situation even if it means you working twice as hard.,2

S09E16 The Boob Job.txt,Chandler,What?,25
S09E16 The Boob Job.txt,Joey,Something personal.,25
S09E16 The Boob Job.txt,Chandler,What would she get for herself for two thousand dollars that she wouldn't tell me about?,25
S09E16 The Boob Job.txt,Woman,Excuse me.,26
S09E16 The Boob Job.txt,Joey,Boob job.,26

S09E16 The Boob Job.txt,Mike,"Well hey, I wanna ask you about Monica's little ""groomy"" joke.",27
S09E16 The Boob Job.txt,Phoebe,Oh! Alright. Well I think the reason people laugh is becuase it's a play on the word roomy.,27
S09E16 The Boob Job.txt,Mike,"I get the joke. Sophisticated as it was. Now the thing I wanna say is... maybe we should have talked about this before. Us living together, you're not expecting a proposal, right?",27
S09E16 The Boob Job.txt,Phoebe,Oh no! No no! Not at all. We're just moving in right now. See where it goes.,27
S09E16 The Boob Job.txt,Mike,"Yeah well, that's the thing. For me it's as far as it can ever go.",27
S09E16 The Boob Job.txt,Phoebe,What do you mean?,27

S09E16 The Boob Job.txt,Phoebe,Oh. Wow.,27
S09E16 The Boob Job.txt,Mike,"It's just my first marriage was, you know such a disaster. I kind of lost faith in the whole idea.",27
S09E16 The Boob Job.txt,Phoebe,Was it really that bad?,27
S09E16 The Boob Job.txt,Mike,At one point near the end she deliberately defecated.....,27
S09E16 The Boob Job.txt,Phoebe,"Ok, well that's bad. But don't you think it might be different with someone else? Perhaps a blonde who always uses a toilet. Except for once in the ocean.",27
S09E16 The Boob Job.txt,Mike,Look it's not about who I would marry. And I was certain the first time I got married it would last forever. And I was totally wrong!,27
S09E16 The Boob Job.txt,Phoebe,But it's just...,27
S09E16 The Boob Job.txt,Mike,"Look Phoebe, It's not about you. I just never wanna get married again.",27
S09E16 The Boob Job.txt,Phoebe,Oh!,27
S09E16 The Boob Job.txt,Mike,I'm sorry. Are you ok with that? Cause if not...maybe us moving in together isn't the best idea.,27
S09E16 The Boob Job.txt,Phoebe,No! I definitely don't wanna get married. No I just wanted to make sure you didn't want to too. Whew! Coz you know when we move in and you start changing your mind there's gonna be hell to pay mister!,27
S09E16 The Boob Job.txt,Mike,"Trust me, I will never...",27
S09E16 The Boob Job.txt,Phoebe,Yeah I get that.,27
S09E16 The Boob Job.txt,Rachel,Hi!,28
S09E16 The Boob Job.txt,Monica,So you gave in and decided to call someone?,28
S09E16 The Boob Job.txt,Rachel,"Yeah, I don't know who I was kidding. I can barely use chopsticks.",28
S09E16 The Boob Job.txt,Handyman,Thanks.....,30
S09E16 The Boob Job.txt,Chandler,Hey Rach! There she is...My perfectly proportioned wife.,31
S09E16 The Boob Job.txt,Rachel,Don't look at me I never get his jokes.,31
S09E16 The Boob Job.txt,Monica,Thank you?,31
S09E16 The Boob Job.txt,Chandler,Oh no..don't thank me. Thank you. You know there's not one thing I would change about you? Not one single thing! And definitely not... two... single things.,31
S09E16 The Boob Job.txt,Monica,"Ok, you're being wierd. Do you want sex or did you do something bad?",31
S09E16 The Boob Job.txt,Chandler,"No no! I just love the way you look, I am warm, for your form.",31
S09E16 The Boob Job.txt,Monica,"Ok..You know the old classics you know,You look nice? They're still ok.",31
S09E16 The Boob Job.txt,Chandler,"Well yes yes... You look nice can mean that your face looks nice. I want to compliment your body. I mean..I wouldn't change it. At all. And more specifically, I wouldn't want anything to get any bigger.",31
S09E16 The Boob Job.txt,Monica,Okay...,31
S09E16 The Boob Job.txt,Chandler,"I mean, You wouldn't want any part of me to get any bigger would you? Don't answer that.",31
S09E16 The Boob Job.txt,Rachel,Just when you thought that dude couldn't get any wierder.,32
S09E16 The Boob Job.txt,Monica,I know why do you think he was so worried about me getting bigger?,32
S09E16 The Boob Job.txt,Rachel,"I don't know! I mean, what brought that on?",32
S09E16 The Boob Job.txt,Monica,Oh my god. We're trying to get pregnant so he's probably starting to freak out about the fact that my body is going to change.,32
S09E16 The Boob Job.txt,Rachel,No you really think that's what it is?,32
S09E16 The Boob Job.txt,Monica,"You heard him! ""No bigger!"" ""You're perfect!"" ""Just don't get any bigger!"" Oh my god he sounded just like my high school wrestling coach. You know what? I'm going to have to talk to Chandler.",32
S09E16 The Boob Job.txt,Phoebe,Hi,34
S09E16 The Boob Job.txt,Ross,Hey!,34
S09E16 The Boob Job.txt,Phoebe,"Listen, I wanted to ask you something about marriage.",34

S09E16 The Boob Job.txt,Ross,"wow, are you still going to move in with him?",34
S09E16 The Boob Job.txt,Phoebe,"I want to, but I just want you to tell me that marriage isn't really that big a deal. You know that I won't, I won't be missing out on anything. That marriage stinks!",34
S09E16 The Boob Job.txt,Ross,"Yeah, marriage... stinks! I mean if you wanna see a man gain weight and a woman stop shaving? Get them married.",34
S09E16 The Boob Job.txt,Phoebe,That's not how you really feel is it?,34
S09E16 The Boob Job.txt,Ross,"No, I'm sorry. Look I don't think that's what you wanna hear right now but I can't help it. I love marriage.",34
S09E16 The Boob Job.txt,Phoebe,Seriously? You divorce-o?,34
S09E16 The Boob Job.txt,Ross,"If you have to call me name, I prefer ""Ross the Divorcer"". It's just cooler. Look, I know my marriage isn't exactly work out. But I love to be that committed to another person. And Carol had some good times before she became a lesbian... and once afterward. I'm sorry.",34
S09E16 The Boob Job.txt,Phoebe,It's ok that's how you feel.,34

S09E16 The Boob Job.txt,Ross,"The Divorcer, to the rescue!",34
S09E16 The Boob Job.txt,Phoebe,It's not cooler.,34

S09E16 The Boob Job.txt,Monica,It's kind of a package deal!,38
S09E16 The Boob Job.txt,Chandler,God why why would you want to do that to yourself!?,38
S09E16 The Boob Job.txt,Monica,I thought I was something that we both wanted!,38
S09E16 The Boob Job.txt,Chandler,"Alright look, if it means that much to you, a may be able to get on more with the big boobs. But the giant ass and the big clown feet?",38
S09E16 The Boob Job.txt,Rachel,"Oh my god Chandler! If you can't handle this, what are you going to be like in the hospital? With the blood and the screaming and the little present that's shooting out of her!?",38
S09E16 The Boob Job.txt,Rachel,Joey! Why did you tell Chandler that Monica was getting a boob job?,40
S09E16 The Boob Job.txt,Joey,Because she is!,40
S09E16 The Boob Job.txt,Monica,"Joey, Chandler knows I borrowed the money.",40

S09E16 The Boob Job.txt,Phoebe,"Oh yeah you were helpful! Yeah, no, thanks you.",41
S09E16 The Boob Job.txt,Ross,"Good, good. Yeah coz the more I thought about it, the more I realised I don't think marriage is neccessarily the right path for you.",41
S09E16 The Boob Job.txt,Phoebe,What do you mean?,41
S09E16 The Boob Job.txt,Ross,"Well, I know the other day in the coffeehouse you were caught up in the whole soccer mom thing? but is that really you? I mean can you honestly picture yourself in a Volvo?",41
S09E16 The Boob Job.txt,Phoebe,They are awfully boxy...,41
S09E16 The Boob Job.txt,Ross,I don't know you'd be so bored with marriage. I mean it's so... normal.,41
S09E16 The Boob Job.txt,Phoebe,Uh huh.,41
S09E16 The Boob Job.txt,Ross,"Hey hey, can I help?",42
S09E16 The Boob Job.txt,Chandler,"Well! We er..climbed up four flights of stairs, manueveored a narrow hallway, dodged a rabid pitbul... but these last three feet are where it gets really tricky.",42
S09E16 The Boob Job.txt,Ross,You know sometimes your words... they hurt.,42
S09E16 The Boob Job.txt,Joey,"Hey uh, where do you guys want this?",42
S09E16 The Boob Job.txt,Phoebe,Just one last time erm... the marriage thing... there's no wiggle room? None at all?,43
S09E16 The Boob Job.txt,Mike,No but... You don't want to get married either right?,43
S09E16 The Boob Job.txt,Phoebe,Right. Except that I do want to get married.,43

S09E16 The Boob Job.txt,Mike,But if you wanna get married why didn't you say something before?,44
S09E16 The Boob Job.txt,Phoebe,"Because I just didn't know how much I wanted it. And I love you, and I wanted to live with you.",44
S09E16 The Boob Job.txt,Mike,I want to live with you too! Let's do that!,44
S09E16 The Boob Job.txt,Phoebe,"But I don't think I can! it was ok to move in when I didn't know what was gonna happen, but I can't move in knowing that nothing is ever gonna happen.",44
S09E16 The Boob Job.txt,Mike,Can we at least try living together? I mean you might change your mind about marriage.,44
S09E16 The Boob Job.txt,Phoebe,Are you gonna change yours?,44
S09E16 The Boob Job.txt,Mike,No.,44
S09E16 The Boob Job.txt,Phoebe,Me neither. I think I need to be with someone who wants what I want.,44

S02E21 The Bullies.txt,Everyone,Ahh.,2
S02E21 The Bullies.txt,Phoebe,And they were serving franks which is his first name minus the s at the end. And there was a rotisserie with spinning chicken.,2
S02E21 The Bullies.txt,Monica,His indian name?,2

S02E21 The Bullies.txt,Phoebe,"I just think that this was a really bad sign, ya know. I mean, like the beast at the threshold, you know. It's just like, I have no family left, ya know. I mean except for my grandmother, you know, but let's face it, she's not gonna be around forever, despite what she says. And I have a sister who I've barely spoken to since we like shared a womb.

S09E21 The Fertility Test.txt,Receptionist,Then why you work here?,35
S09E21 The Fertility Test.txt,Phoebe,'Cause it's good money! But that doesn't change the fact that this is an evil blood sucking corporate machine!,35
S09E21 The Fertility Test.txt,Receptionist,"Well, I think this is a great place to work!",35
S09E21 The Fertility Test.txt,Joey,Ross!,38

S09E21 The Fertility Test.txt,Ross,Get to the problem!,39
S09E21 The Fertility Test.txt,Joey,Yes. It's just that she's so much smarter than all the girls I've ever dated! Combined! I don't want her to think I'm stupid!,39
S09E21 The Fertility Test.txt,Ross,You were saying you didn't want to seem stupid.,41
S09E21 The Fertility Test.txt,Joey,"Right, right, right, well, she wants to go to all this cultural places and I don't know how to talk about that stuff. You gotta help me out!",41
S09E21 The Fertility Test.txt,Ross,"You know, I really don't want to get involved in you guy's relationship.",41
S09E21 The Fertility Test.txt,Joey,"Please, c'mon, you're the smartest person I know and I really like this girl, ok, I don't wanna lose her.",41
S09E21 The Fertility Test.txt,Joey,Thanks.,42

S09E21 The Fertility Test.txt,Joey,"Ok, all right, so I'll take her to the MET.",43
S09E21 The Fertility Test.txt,Ross,"Yeah, uh, uh, ok, there's this great rare bookstore on Madison Avenue. You know what? She loves architecture, you know what you should do? You should take a walk down fifth to the Saint Patrick's Cathedral and there there's this great little pastry shop that she'd love.",43
S09E21 The Fertility Test.txt,Joey,"Geez, sounds like you should be going on this date!",43
S09E21 The Fertility Test.txt,Joey,"Whoa, whoa, whoa! Slow down, you go way too fast. Ok? Just go back to the MET, ok?",44
S09E21 The Fertility Test.txt,Ross,Ok.,44
S09E21 The Fertility Test.txt,Joey,You got to tell me exactly what to do there.,44
S09E21 The Fertility Test.txt,Ross,"Ok, when you walk in the museum, take the right, that's the antiquities wing. Ancient Egypt, Mesopotamia, up to the Byzantine Empire.",44
S09E21 The Fertility Test.txt,Monica,"Because, honey, I mean this in the sweetest way possible, nobody is gonna wanna watch that.",47
S09E21 The Fertility Test.txt,Chandler,"Deposit my specimen? You know, usually I have to call a 900 number for that kind of talk. Thanks, got it.",49
S09E21 The Fertility Test.txt,Monica,"Hey, honey, my test is down the hall, are you sure you're going to be ok?",49
S09E21 The Fertility Test.txt,Chandler,"Yeah, I guess!",49
S09E21 The Fertility Test.txt,Monica,"I know this is embarrassing, but nobody cares! No one here even knows you!",49
S09E21 The Fertility Test.txt,Janice,OH MY GOD!!,49
S09E21 The Fertility Test.txt,Chandler,"Oh, Come on!",49
S09E21 The Fertility Test.txt,Janice,Ah ahahahhahaa! How great is this!,49
S09E21 The Fertility Test.txt,Monica,"Hey, we're probably fertile, let's go home!",49
S09E21 The Fertility Test.txt,Chandler,Why are you here?,49
S09E21 The Fertility Test.txt,Janice,"Well, Sid and I are trying again and we had trouble last time because apparently we...",49
S09E21 The Fertility Test.txt,Chandler,What!?,51
S09E21 The Fertility Test.txt,Phoebe,"Okay, then I'm Swedish...",59
S09E21 The Fertility Test.txt,Monica,"So, what's your name?",59
S09E21 The Fertility Test.txt,Phoebe,It's a normal Swedish name... Ikea...,59
S09E21 The Fertility Test.txt,Rachel,Oh... what an interesting name.,59
S09E21 The Fertility Test.txt,Phoebe,Ja!,59
S09E21 The Fertility Test.txt,Phoebe,Is something wrong?,62
S09E21 The Fertility Test.txt,Rachel,Damn! I wish I knew if that was right!,64
S09E21 The Fertility Test.txt,Ross,"Now, do you have any idea what you just said?",66
S09E21 The Fertility Test.txt,Ross,"Ok now, remember, when you get to the museum, Monet is not spelt M-O-N-A-Y. I just... I wrote that out phonetically for you.",67
S09E21 The Fertility Test.txt,Ross,"Yeah, yeah that means... you know? We just... we don't have time for this.",68
S09E21 The Fertility Test.txt,Joey,Ok.,68
S09E21 The Fertility Test.txt,Ross,"Ok, but you know what? I gotta say, I'm really impressed that you were able to memorize all this so quickly!",68
S09E21 The Fertility Test.txt,Joey,"Ah! I'm an actor! I can memorize anything! Last week on ""Days"" I had to say ""Frontal temporal zygomatic craniotomy"".",68
S09E21 The Fertility Test.txt,Ross,Wow. What does that mean?,68
S09E21 The Fertility Test.txt,Joey,"No idea! But the guy I said it to dies in the next scene so I guess it means ""you're gonna get eaten by a bear"".",68
S09E21 The Fertility Test.txt,Ross,Ok! So let's move on to the Renaissance?,68
S09E21 The Fertility Test.txt,Janice,Oh! Sid is still in his room. I don't allow porn at home so this is like a vacation for him. So did you do it? Did you make your deposit?,74
S09E21 The Fertility Test.txt,Chandler,Yeah! yeah... The hard part is over!,74
S09E21 The Fertility Test.txt,Janice,"That's not the hard part honey! The hard part is what comes next, I mean aren't you worried about the results?",74
S09E21 The Fertility Test.txt,Chandler,I haven't... I haven't even thought about the results yet... I just assumed that everything was gonna be ok.,74
S09E21 The Fertility Test.txt,Janice,"Oh! Well, you know what? It probably is.",74
S09E21 The Fertility Test.txt,Janice,"Oh, Chandler, look. You and Monica are meant to have children. I am sure it's gonna be just fine.",75
S09E21 The Fertility Test.txt,Janice,"What, you can do it in the parking lot of a Taco Bell, but you can't do it at a doctor's office?",76
S09E21 The Fertility Test.txt,Rachel,"Wow, Ikea... what a rich culture. Uhm, you know what? I have a friend who is a masseuse.",79
S09E21 The Fertility Test.txt,Phoebe,"Oh, Ja! Ja!",79
S09E21 The Fertility Test.txt,Phoebe,"Uhu, uhu... and why do you think that is?",80
S09E21 The Fertility Test.txt,Rachel,I don't know... maybe it's because she has got such callousy fingers from playing crummy guitar...,80
S09E21 The Fertility Test.txt,Phoebe,Or... maybe she has trouble loosening your knots because you're such a high maintenance tight ass!,80
S09E21 The Fertility Test.txt,Phoebe,You know it's me?,81
S09E21 The Fertility Test.txt,Rachel,"For like a half an hour! Man, you can lie about Sweden!",81
S09E21 The Fertility Test.txt,Phoebe,How can you come here?,81
S09E21 The Fertility Test.txt,Rachel,How could you not tell me you worked here?,81
S09E21 The Fertility Test.txt,Phoebe,I don't have to tell you everything!,81
S09E21 The Fertility Test.txt,Rachel,"Yes you do, if you're going to make me feel guilty for getting a free massage!",81
S09E21 The Fertility Test.txt,Phoebe,Tips not included.,81
S09E21 The Fertility Test.txt,Rachel,"Oh! Phoebe, why did you lie to me about working here?",81
S09E21 The Fertility Test.txt,Phoebe,"Because I was ashamed ok? I sold out for the cash! And then they give me benefits like medical, and dental, and a 401K. But you know... you pay a price. Now I'm this Corporate stooge and punching a clock and Ugh! paying taxes!",81
S09E21 The Fertility Test.txt,Rachel,"Phoebe, honey, if you hate it so much, you should walk out there right now and quit! Be true to what you believe in! Honey, you have principles and I so admire that! I don't have any!",81
S09E21 The Fertility Test.txt,Phoebe,You know what? You are right. I am gonna quit. It's time I took my life back!,81
S09E21 The Fertility Test.txt,Rachel,Good for you Pheebs!,81
S09E21 The Fertility Test.txt,Phoebe,Ok.,81
S09E21 The Fertility Test.txt,Ross,"Haha! Got ya! Die, die, die!",83
S09E21 The Fertility Test.txt,Charlie,Hi!,85
S09E21 The Fertility Test.txt,Ross,"Hey, how was the Met?",85
S09E21 The Fertility Test.txt,Charlie,The museum was amazing!,85
S09E21 The Fertility Test.txt,Ross,"Yeah? Joey really knows his art, huh?",85
S09E21 The Fertility Test.txt,Charlie,"Not so much, no. He had clearly memorized all the stuff to say, and some of it didn't even make any sense.",85
S09E21 The Fertility Test.txt,Ross,What do you mean?,85
S09E21 The Fertility Test.txt,Charlie,"Well, for one, he was talking about paintings that were nowhere around.",85
S09E21 The Fertility Test.txt,Charlie,"No, we went to the left.",86
S09E21 The Fertility Test.txt,Ross,What?,88
S09E21 The Fertility Test.txt,Charlie,"Actually, you know, Joey is your friend, and you don't really know me that well; it would be weird.",88
S09E21 The Fertility Test.txt,Ross,"What, I mean, a little, but no, what, go on.",88
S09E21 The Fertility Test.txt,Charlie,"Well... I'm just thinking that maybe he's not the right guy to be with right now, maybe I should be with someone... I have more in common with. You know what I mean?",88
S09E21 The Fertility Test.txt,Charlie,"Yeah, I guess that's true.",89
S09E21 The Fertility Test.txt,Ross,"And if you think about it, I mean the reason he memorized all that stuff is because he thought it was important to you. You know, that's the kind of guy Joey is.",89
S09E21 The Fertility Test.txt,Charlie,He is very sweet. Plus he's hot!,89
S09E21 The Fertility Test.txt,Ross,That was going to be my next argument.,89
S09E21 The Fertility Test.txt,Joey,Hey!,90
S09E21 The Fertility Test.txt,Ross,Hey!,90
S09E21 The Fertility Test.txt,Charlie,Hey!,90
S09E21 The Fertility Test.txt,Ross,Glad I could help man.,93
S09E21 The Fertility Test.txt,Monica,Hey sweetie.,99
S09E21 The Fertility Test.txt,Chandler,Doctor Connelly just called.,99
S09E21 The Fertility Test.txt,Chandler,Actually it's both of us.,100
S09E21 The Fertility Test.txt,Monica,What?,100
S09E21 The Fertility Test.txt,Chandler,Apparently my sperm have low motility and you have an inhospitable environment.,100
S09E21 The Fertility Test.txt,Monica,Oh... what does that mean?,100
S09E21 The Fertility Test.txt,Monica,Chandler?,101
S09E21 The Fertility Test.txt,Chandler,I'm sorry.,103
S09E21 The Fertility Test.txt,Monica,I'm sorry too.,103
S09E21 The Fertility Test.txt,Chandler,"Well, we're gonna... we're gonna figure this out.",104
S09E21 The Fertility Test.txt,Receptionist,Good morning Phoebe.,106
S09E21 The Fertility Test.txt,Receptionist,Here's your schedule for the day. Your first client is in room No. 1.,107

S01E15 The Stoned Guy.txt,Ross,Grazie.,4
S01E15 The Stoned Guy.txt,Rachel,Yeah?,6
S01E15 The Stoned Guy.txt,Monica,Why does my cinamon stick have an eraser?,6
S01E15 The Stoned Guy.txt,Woman,Chandler.,9
S01E15 The Stoned Guy.txt,Chandler,"Mrs. Tedlock. You're looking lovely today. And may I say, that is a very flattering sleeve length on you.",9
S01E15 The Stoned Guy.txt,Phoebe,"Hey you guys! Chandler's coming and he says he has, like, this incredible news, so when he gets here, we could all act like, you know...",11
S01E15 The Stoned Guy.txt,Chandler,Hey!,12
S01E15 The Stoned Guy.txt,All,Hey!,12
S01E15 The Stoned Guy.txt,Phoebe,Never mind. But it was going to be really good.,12
S01E15 The Stoned Guy.txt,Ross,What's going on?,12
S01E15 The Stoned Guy.txt,All,What is it?,12
S01E15 The Stoned Guy.txt,Chandler,"So, it's a typical day at work. I'm inputting my numbers, and big Al calls me into his office and tells me he wants to make me processing supervisor.",12
S01E15 The Stoned Guy.txt,All,That's great!,12
S01E15 The Stoned Guy.txt,Chandler,So.... I quit.,12
S01E15 The Stoned Guy.txt,All,Why?,12
S01E15 The Stoned Guy.txt,Chandler,Why? This was supposed to be a temp job!,12
S01E15 The Stoned Guy.txt,Monica,"Yeah, Chandler... you've been there for five years.",12
S01E15 The Stoned Guy.txt,Chandler,"If I took this promotion, it'd be like admitting that this is what I actually do.",12
S01E15 The Stoned Guy.txt,Phoebe,So was it a lot more money?,12
S01E15 The Stoned Guy.txt,Chandler,It doesn't matter. I just don't want to be one of those guys that's in his office until twelve o'clock at night worrying about the WENUS.,12
S01E15 The Stoned Guy.txt,Rachel,... the WENUS?,13
S01E15 The Stoned Guy.txt,Chandler,Weekly Estimated Net Usage Systems. A processing term.,13
S01E15 The Stoned Guy.txt,Joey,So what're you going to do?,14
S01E15 The Stoned Guy.txt,Chandler,I don't know. That's the thing. I don't know what I want to do. I just know I'm not going to figure it out working there.,14
S01E15 The Stoned Guy.txt,Chandler,Yeah... I just don't have that much cheffing experience. Unless it's an all-toast restaurant.,17
S01E15 The Stoned Guy.txt,Monica,"Well, what kind of food is he looking for?",18
S01E15 The Stoned Guy.txt,Phoebe,"Well, he wants to do some ecclectic, so he's looking for someone who can, you know, create the entire menu.",18
S01E15 The Stoned Guy.txt,Chandler,"Thanks, Phoebe. But I just don't really see myself in a big white hat.",20
S01E15 The Stoned Guy.txt,Chandler,Can you see my nipples through this shirt?,22
S01E15 The Stoned Guy.txt,Rachel,"No. But don't worry, I'm sure they're still there.",22
S01E15 The Stoned Guy.txt,Phoebe,"Where are you going, Mr. Suity-Man?",22
S01E15 The Stoned Guy.txt,Rachel,Career counselor?,23
S01E15 The Stoned Guy.txt,Chandler,"Hey, you guys all know what you want to do.",23
S01E15 The Stoned Guy.txt,Rachel,I don't!,23
S01E15 The Stoned Guy.txt,Chandler,"Hey, you guys in the living room all know what you want to do. You know, you have goals. You have dreams. I don't have a dream.",23
S01E15 The Stoned Guy.txt,Ross,"Ah, the lesser-known ""I don't have a dream"" speech.",23
S01E15 The Stoned Guy.txt,Monica,"Oh, I love my life, I love my life!",24
S01E15 The Stoned Guy.txt,Phoebe,Ooh! Brian's Song!,24
S01E15 The Stoned Guy.txt,Rachel,The meeting with the guy went great?,24
S01E15 The Stoned Guy.txt,Monica,"So great! He showed me where the restaurant's going to be. It's this, it's this cute little place on 10th Street. Not too big, not too small. Just right.",24
S01E15 The Stoned Guy.txt,Chandler,Was it formerly owned by a blonde woman and some bears?,24
S01E15 The Stoned Guy.txt,Monica,"So anyway, I'm cooking dinner for him Monday night. You know, kind of like an audition. And Phoebe, he really wants you to be here, which will be great for me because then you can 'ooh' and 'ahh' and make yummy noises.",24
S01E15 The Stoned Guy.txt,Rachel,What are you going to make?,24
S01E15 The Stoned Guy.txt,Monica,I don't know. I don't know. It's just going to be so great!,26
S01E15 The Stoned Guy.txt,Ross,"Hey guys, does anybody know a good date place in the neighborhood?",27
S01E15 The Stoned Guy.txt,Joey,"How about Tony's? If you can finish a 32-ounce steak, it's free.",27
S01E15 The Stoned Guy.txt,Ross,"OK, ahem, hey, does anybody know a good place if you're not dating a puma?",27
S01E15 The Stoned Guy.txt,Chandler,Who are you going out with?,27
S01E15 The Stoned Guy.txt,Phoebe,"Oh, is this the bug lady?",27
S01E15 The Stoned Guy.txt,Ross,Her name is Celia. She's not a bug lady. She's curator of insects at the museum.,28
S01E15 The Stoned Guy.txt,Rachel,So what are you guys going to do?,28
S01E15 The Stoned Guy.txt,Ross,"Oh, I just thought we could go out to dinner, and then maybe bring her back to my place and I'd introduce her to my monkey.",28
S01E15 The Stoned Guy.txt,Chandler,And he's not speaking metaphorically.,28
S01E15 The Stoned Guy.txt,Joey,"I'm telling you, that monkey is a chick magnet! She's going to take one look at his furry, cute little face and it'll seal the deal.",30
S01E15 The Stoned Guy.txt,Ross,"Celia, don't worry!  Don't scream!  He's not going to hurt you! Soothing tones, Celia. Soothing tones! Marcel...",31
S01E15 The Stoned Guy.txt,Celia,I can't stand this! He's got his claws in my...,31
S01E15 The Stoned Guy.txt,Monica,Is it better than the other salmon mousse?,35
S01E15 The Stoned Guy.txt,Joey,It's creamier.,35
S01E15 The Stoned Guy.txt,Monica,"Yeah, well, is that better?",35
S01E15 The Stoned Guy.txt,Joey,"I don't know. We're talking about whipped fish, Monica. I'm just happy I'm keeping it down, y'know?",35
S01E15 The Stoned Guy.txt,Rachel,My God! What happened to you?,36
S01E15 The Stoned Guy.txt,Phoebe,That's so great! 'Cause you already know how to do that!,37
S01E15 The Stoned Guy.txt,Chandler,"Can you believe it? I mean, don't I seem like somebody who should be doing something really cool? You know, I just always pictured myself doing something...something.",37
S01E15 The Stoned Guy.txt,Chandler,"Ooh, you know, I had a grape about five hours ago, so I'd better split this with you.",39
S01E15 The Stoned Guy.txt,Monica,It's supposed to be that small. It's a pre-appetizer. The French call it an amouz-bouche.,39
S01E15 The Stoned Guy.txt,Phoebe,Ten dollars an hour for what?,42
S01E15 The Stoned Guy.txt,Monica,"Oh, I asked one of the waitresses at work if she'd help me out.",42
S01E15 The Stoned Guy.txt,Joey,Uh-oh.,43
S01E15 The Stoned Guy.txt,Monica,Well... of course I thought of you! But... but...,43
S01E15 The Stoned Guy.txt,Rachel,"But, but?",43
S01E15 The Stoned Guy.txt,Monica,"But, you see, it's just... this night has to go just perfect, you know? And, well, Wendy's more of a... professional waitress.",43
S01E15 The Stoned Guy.txt,Rachel,Oh! I see. And I've sort of been maintaining my amateur status so that I can waitress in the Olympics.,43
S01E15 The Stoned Guy.txt,Celia,Talk to me.,45
S01E15 The Stoned Guy.txt,Ross,"OK.... um, a weird thing happened to me on the train this morning...",45
S01E15 The Stoned Guy.txt,Celia,No no no. Talk... dirty.,45
S01E15 The Stoned Guy.txt,Celia,Yes...,46
S01E15 The Stoned Guy.txt,Ross,Ah....,46
S01E15 The Stoned Guy.txt,Celia,Say something..... hot.,46
S01E15 The Stoned Guy.txt,Celia,What?,47
S01E15 The Stoned Guy.txt,Ross,Um... uh.... vulva.,47
S01E15 The Stoned Guy.txt,Ross,"Alright, I panicked, alright? She took me by surprise. You know, but it wasn't a total loss. I mean, we ended up cuddling.",49
S01E15 The Stoned Guy.txt,Ross,"Shut up! It was nice. I just... I don't think I'm the dirty-talking kind of guy, you know?",50
S01E15 The Stoned Guy.txt,Joey,What's the big deal? You just say what you want to do to her. Or what you want her to do to you. Or what you think other people might be doing to each other. I'll tell you what. Just try something on me.,50
S01E15 The Stoned Guy.txt,Joey,"Why not? Come on! Just, just close your eyes and tell me what you'd like to be doing right now.",51
S01E15 The Stoned Guy.txt,Joey,....yeah... what else?,52
S01E15 The Stoned Guy.txt,Ross,"Joey, please.",54
S01E15 The Stoned Guy.txt,Joey,"Alright, now you say something.",56
S01E15 The Stoned Guy.txt,Ross,I... ahem... I really don't think so.,56
S01E15 The Stoned Guy.txt,Joey,"Come on! You like this woman, right?",56
S01E15 The Stoned Guy.txt,Ross,Yeah.,56
S01E15 The Stoned Guy.txt,Joey,"You want to see her again, right?",56
S01E15 The Stoned Guy.txt,Ross,Sure.,56
S01E15 The Stoned Guy.txt,Joey,"Well if you can't talk dirty to me, how're you going to talk dirty to her? Now tell me you want to caress my butt!",56
S01E15 The Stoned Guy.txt,Ross,"Ahem... I want.... OK, I want to... feel your... hot, soft skin with my lips.",58
S01E15 The Stoned Guy.txt,Joey,There you go! Keep going. Keep going!,58
S01E15 The Stoned Guy.txt,Ross,"I, er...",58
S01E15 The Stoned Guy.txt,Ross,I want to take my tongue... and...,59
S01E15 The Stoned Guy.txt,Ross,....and....,60
S01E15 The Stoned Guy.txt,Joey,Say it... say it!,60
S01E15 The Stoned Guy.txt,Ross,...run it all over your body until you're... trembling with... with...,60
S01E15 The Stoned Guy.txt,Joey,You're not going to believe this!,63
S01E15 The Stoned Guy.txt,Chandler,It's OK. It's OK. I was always rooting for you two kids to get together.,63
S01E15 The Stoned Guy.txt,Joey,"Hey Chandler, while you were sleeping that guy from your old job called again.",63
S01E15 The Stoned Guy.txt,Chandler,Again?,63
S01E15 The Stoned Guy.txt,Chandler,Well?,66
S01E15 The Stoned Guy.txt,Phoebe,Oh! You have a window!,68
S01E15 The Stoned Guy.txt,Phoebe,Oh look! That guy's peeing!,69
S01E15 The Stoned Guy.txt,Chandler,"Thank you Helen, that'll be all.",73
S01E15 The Stoned Guy.txt,Chandler,"Last time I do that, I promise.",74
S01E15 The Stoned Guy.txt,Rachel,Who was that?,76
S01E15 The Stoned Guy.txt,Monica,Wendy bailed. I have no waitress.,76
S01E15 The Stoned Guy.txt,Monica,Ten dollars an hour.,77

S02E23 The Chicken Pox.txt,Joey,"Hey, is that when you wrote salt water taffy man?",10
S02E23 The Chicken Pox.txt,Phoebe,"No. No, he is my submaring guy. He resurfaces like every couple years and we have the most amazing three days together. Only this time he's coming for two weeks. Two whole weeks, which means yay.",10

S02E23 The Chicken Pox.txt,Monica,Baddest. Otherwise the song would be Fat Fat Leroy Brown.,16
S02E23 The Chicken Pox.txt,Richard,What're you doing?,16

S02E23 The Chicken Pox.txt,Richard,Are you remaking the bed?,16

S02E23 The Chicken Pox.txt,Richard,"Then, you're redoing it because...",16
S02E23 The Chicken Pox.txt,Monica,"If I tell you, you'll think I'm crazy.",16
S02E23 The Chicken Pox.txt,Richard,You're pretty much running that risk either way.,16
S02E23 The Chicken Pox.txt,Monica,"Ok, you see, the tag shouldn't be at the top left corner, it should be at the bottom right corner.",16
S02E23 The Chicken Pox.txt,Richard,"Oh, well that's not so crazy.",16
S02E23 The Chicken Pox.txt,Monica,I'm just easing you in.,16
S02E23 The Chicken Pox.txt,Richard,"Oh, alright.",16
S02E23 The Chicken Pox.txt,Monica,"Alright, you see these little flower blossoms? They should be facing up, not down, because, well, the head of the bed is where the sun would be. You don't love me any more do you.",16
S02E23 The Chicken Pox.txt,Richard,"Actually, if it's possible, I love you more.",16
S02E23 The Chicken Pox.txt,Monica,"Really? Wow, well then come on, I wanna show you how to fold the toilet paper into a point.",16

S02E23 The Chicken Pox.txt,Joey,But don't you need experience for a job like that?,17
S02E23 The Chicken Pox.txt,Chandler,"It's not that hard to learn. And as for people realizing you have no idea what you're doing, hey, you're an actor. Act like a processor, people will think you're a processor.",17
S02E23 The Chicken Pox.txt,Chandler,"Hey thanks. Scott Alexander, Joey Tribbianni. Joey is a uh, fellow processor.",18

S02E23 The Chicken Pox.txt,Ryan,Chicken or small?,23
S02E23 The Chicken Pox.txt,Phoebe,Chicken. Which is so ironic considering I'm a vegetarian.,23
S02E23 The Chicken Pox.txt,Ryan,Why aren't you at home in bed?,23
S02E23 The Chicken Pox.txt,Phoebe,"'Cause my, my grandmother's never had chicken pox. Please, please tell me you have, 'cause oh my God, I forgot how cute you are.",23
S02E23 The Chicken Pox.txt,Ryan,"I'm sorry, I never had 'em.",23
S02E23 The Chicken Pox.txt,Phoebe,"Ohh, ohh.",23
S02E23 The Chicken Pox.txt,Ryan,"If I had one wish, it would be to build a time machine, go back to when I was 7, when Jimmy Hauser had the chicken pox. I would grab that kid and rub him all over my face.",23
S02E23 The Chicken Pox.txt,Phoebe,"Yeah, or you know, you could just wish that I didn't have them now.",23
S02E23 The Chicken Pox.txt,Ryan,Can I please see your face?,23
S02E23 The Chicken Pox.txt,Phoebe,Nope. You don't want to see a face covered with pox.,23
S02E23 The Chicken Pox.txt,Ryan,"Your face could be covered with lochs, I wouldn't care.",23
S02E23 The Chicken Pox.txt,Ryan,"Sorry, the lightning. Lightning was an unfortunate incidence. You look lovely, lovely.",24
S02E23 The Chicken Pox.txt,Phoebe,"I hate this. 'Cause I tell you, I had the most amazing two weeks planned for us, and almost everything I had in mind, we had to be a lot closer than this.",24
S02E23 The Chicken Pox.txt,Phoebe,"Ok, this is the most romantic disease I've ever had.",25
S02E23 The Chicken Pox.txt,Joey,Hey.,26
S02E23 The Chicken Pox.txt,Chandler,"Hey, how's the first day goin'?",26
S02E23 The Chicken Pox.txt,Joey,Pretty good. It's like you said. It's mostly just putting numbers from one column into another column.,26
S02E23 The Chicken Pox.txt,Chandler,Well there you go.,26
S02E23 The Chicken Pox.txt,Joey,"Hey and everbody is so nice. I just had a good talk with that lady with the red hair, Jeannie.",26

S02E23 The Chicken Pox.txt,Chandler,Ya know there isn't a part of that sentence I don't need explained.,26
S02E23 The Chicken Pox.txt,Joey,"Well, see when you're acting you need to think about stuff like that. My character, Joseph the processor guy, has two little girls, Ashley and Brittany. Ashley copies everything Brittany does.",26
S02E23 The Chicken Pox.txt,Chandler,"Well, invisible kids can be that way sometimes.",26
S02E23 The Chicken Pox.txt,Joey,"Yeah. Joseph and his wife, Karen, are thinking of having a third kid... Ya know what? Just did.",26
S02E23 The Chicken Pox.txt,Chandler,Really? Wow. That's some pretty powerful imaginary sperm you must have there.,26
S02E23 The Chicken Pox.txt,Ryan,You know what makes the itching even worse?,27
S02E23 The Chicken Pox.txt,Phoebe,That you don't stop talking about it.,27
S02E23 The Chicken Pox.txt,Ryan,Fine.,27
S02E23 The Chicken Pox.txt,Ryan,What're you doing? Are you scratching?,28

S02E23 The Chicken Pox.txt,Phoebe,"Now do me, do my back. Oh come on, harder.",31
S02E23 The Chicken Pox.txt,Rachel,"Oh, stop that, stop that right now.",32
S02E23 The Chicken Pox.txt,Ross,"You know, I might have expected this of you Phoebe, but Ryan, you're a military man.",32
S02E23 The Chicken Pox.txt,Joey,"You and Milton have to join us on the boat. Karen'll pack a lunch, you'll bring the kids, we'll make a day of it.",33

S02E23 The Chicken Pox.txt,Jeannie,Bye bye Joey.,33
S02E23 The Chicken Pox.txt,Joey,What a phony.,33

S02E23 The Chicken Pox.txt,Joey,Sir.,33
S02E23 The Chicken Pox.txt,Chandler,Well the people in my group wanna spend the holiday weekend with their families.,33
S02E23 The Chicken Pox.txt,Joey,"Yeah Bing, what's that about?",33
S02E23 The Chicken Pox.txt,Chandler,"It's about cutting my people a little slack, ya know, for morale. Look, if you wanna see some rough numbers, I can get them to you by Wednesday.",33
S02E23 The Chicken Pox.txt,Joey,This company was not built on rough numbers. Am I right Mr. Douglas.,33
S02E23 The Chicken Pox.txt,Chandler,"Uh, if you say so sir.",33
S02E23 The Chicken Pox.txt,Joey,"Joseph's good, isn't he?",33
S02E23 The Chicken Pox.txt,Chandler,"Well, I'm going to kill you.",33
S02E23 The Chicken Pox.txt,Joey,"Hey, hey, I just figure Joseph's the kinda guy that likes to mix it up. Ya know, get in there, ruffle some feathers.",33
S02E23 The Chicken Pox.txt,Chandler,Why?,33
S02E23 The Chicken Pox.txt,Joey,"Look, I'm sorry but that's what Joseph does, ok. If you try to pull somethin', he'll call you on it. 'What're you tryin' to pull,' he'll say.",33
S02E23 The Chicken Pox.txt,Richard,"Ooh, duct tape. Was I supposed to bring something too?",34
S02E23 The Chicken Pox.txt,Monica,This is for the scratchy twins out there. I taped oven mits to their hands.,34
S02E23 The Chicken Pox.txt,Richard,You're strict.,34
S02E23 The Chicken Pox.txt,Monica,It's for their own good.,34
S02E23 The Chicken Pox.txt,Richard,"You know, I like the way you have efficiently folded this tab under. See in a tape emergency you could shave valuable seconds off your time.",34
S02E23 The Chicken Pox.txt,Monica,"Exactly. Oh, I love that I can be totally neurotic around you now. Tell me the truth. Don't you like it better now that everything on your desk is perpendicular?",34
S02E23 The Chicken Pox.txt,Richard,"If it's not a right angle, it is a wrong angle.",34
S02E23 The Chicken Pox.txt,Monica,Very good.,34
S02E23 The Chicken Pox.txt,Richard,Thank you.,34
S02E23 The Chicken Pox.txt,Monica,You know what. Tomorrow I'm gonna do your clocks.,34
S02E23 The Chicken Pox.txt,Richard,You're gonna do what to my clocks.,34
S02E23 The Chicken Pox.txt,Monica,I'm gonna set them to my time.,34
S02E23 The Chicken Pox.txt,Richard,"Well, I'm confused. I thought we shared time.",34
S02E23 The Chicken Pox.txt,Monica,"No no. See, in my bedroom I set my clock six minutes fast. You wanna know why?",34
S02E23 The Chicken Pox.txt,Richard,Because it's in a slightly different time zone than the kitchen.,34
S02E23 The Chicken Pox.txt,Monica,"No forget it, I'm not gonna tell you now.",34
S02E23 The Chicken Pox.txt,Richard,No come on. Come on tell me.,34

S02E23 The Chicken Pox.txt,Monica,"Alright, well tell me one of yours.",34
S02E23 The Chicken Pox.txt,Richard,"Ok. Ahh. One of my things is, I always separate my sweat socks from my dress socks.",34
S02E23 The Chicken Pox.txt,Monica,What if they get mixed up?,34
S02E23 The Chicken Pox.txt,Richard,"Boy I would just uh, I would freak out.",34
S02E23 The Chicken Pox.txt,Monica,"You would not. I can't believe this. I hate this, you're too normal. I can't believe my boyfriend doesn't have a thing. My boyfriend doesn't have a thing.",34
S02E23 The Chicken Pox.txt,Richard,"See, if anyone overheard that, I didn't come off well.",34
S02E23 The Chicken Pox.txt,Joey,Hey. Mr. Douglas is looking for you.,35
S02E23 The Chicken Pox.txt,Chandler,Why? Wh- wh- why is Mr. Douglas looking for me?,35
S02E23 The Chicken Pox.txt,Joey,'Cause he has a strong suspicion that you dropped the ball on the Lender project.,35
S02E23 The Chicken Pox.txt,Chandler,"Wha- wh- why, why, why does he suspect that?",35
S02E23 The Chicken Pox.txt,Joey,"Becasue at first he thought it was Joseph. But after he asked Joseph about it, turns out it was you. Anyway, I just thought you should know.",35
S02E23 The Chicken Pox.txt,Chandler,"Alright, that's it. Look Joey, I'm sorry, I realize this is the role of a lifetime for ya, and if I could just fire Joseph, I would, but unfortunately that's not possible so I'm gonna have to let both of you go.",35
S02E23 The Chicken Pox.txt,Joey,"What're you talking about, everybody loves Joseph.",35
S02E23 The Chicken Pox.txt,Chandler,"I don't, I hate Joseph, ok. I think he's a brown-nosing suck up.",35
S02E23 The Chicken Pox.txt,Joey,"Oh yeah. Well you can't fire Joseph. You know why, 'cause he's not in your department.",35
S02E23 The Chicken Pox.txt,Chandler,"Alright, ok, alright. So I can't fire Joseph but uh, I can sleep with his wife.",35
S02E23 The Chicken Pox.txt,Joey,Karen.,35
S02E23 The Chicken Pox.txt,Chandler,"Yeah, Karen. I'm thinking about having an affair with her. Oh, you know what? I just did.",35
S02E23 The Chicken Pox.txt,Joey,Ahh. What the hell are you doing to me man.,35
S02E23 The Chicken Pox.txt,Chandler,"Oh well it's not me, it's my character, Chandy. Yeah the rogue processor who seduces his co-worker's wives for sport and then laughs about it the next day at the water cooler. In fact, I have her panties right there in my drawer.",35
S02E23 The Chicken Pox.txt,Joey,Really?,35
S02E23 The Chicken Pox.txt,Chandler,"No freakshow, she's fictional.",35
S02E23 The Chicken Pox.txt,Joey,"Take it easy. If it means that much to you, I'll uh, I'll go find something else.",35
S02E23 The Chicken Pox.txt,Chandler,Thank you.,35
S02E23 The Chicken Pox.txt,Phoebe,Can I please take these off? I swear I won't scratch.,37

S01E07 The Blackout.txt,Paolo,Bed?,105

S07E13 Rosita Dies.txt,Rachel,"Joey, it’s just a chair! What’s the big deal?",3
S07E13 Rosita Dies.txt,Joey,The big deal is that it is the exact equal distance from the bathroom to the kitchen and it’s at the perfect angle so you don’t get any glare coming of off Stevie.,3
S07E13 Rosita Dies.txt,Rachel,Stevie the TV?,3
S07E13 Rosita Dies.txt,Ross,"Hey, y’know what’s weird? After you guys get married, when you introduce me to people you’re gonna have to say, ""This is my brother-in-law Ross."" Not, ""My friend Ross,"" ""brother-in-law Ross."" That’s weird isn’t it?",6
S07E13 Rosita Dies.txt,Chandler,"Couldn’t I just say, ""This is Ross?""",6
S07E13 Rosita Dies.txt,Ross,Yeah?,9

S07E13 Rosita Dies.txt,Ross,I can’t believe they-they didn’t even tell us!,10
S07E13 Rosita Dies.txt,Phoebe,I can’t believe I still don’t know what happened to the window in the attic!,10
S07E13 Rosita Dies.txt,Rachel,"Joey, Joey I am so sorry.",14
S07E13 Rosita Dies.txt,Joey,"I told you not to move it! Rach, how would you feel if say, I wanted to move you mom, and you said don’t, and I did it anyway and her head fell off?",14
S07E13 Rosita Dies.txt,Rachel,"Okay, come on—Joey, I’ll buy you a new one! All right? We’ll go down to the store right now and we’ll-we’ll get you a new chair.",14
S07E13 Rosita Dies.txt,Rachel,"But don’t you think Rosita would’ve wanted you to move on? I mean y’know, she did always put…your comfort first.",15
S07E13 Rosita Dies.txt,Joey,That’s true.,15
S07E13 Rosita Dies.txt,Ross,"I can’t believe we have to say goodbye to the house we grew up in. Man, some-some stranger’s gonna be living in my room.",19
S07E13 Rosita Dies.txt,Monica,"Well, after 15 years of mom and dad keeping it as a shrine to you, it’s time the velvet ropes came down.",19
S07E13 Rosita Dies.txt,Ross,They kept your room for a while.,19
S07E13 Rosita Dies.txt,Monica,"Oh please! Dad turned my room into a gym 20 minutes after I moved out! I gotta say, a tanning bed and a stack of Victoria’s Secret catalogues, not a gym!",19
S07E13 Rosita Dies.txt,Ross,"Come on, you know they love you.",19
S07E13 Rosita Dies.txt,Monica,As much as they love you?,19
S07E13 Rosita Dies.txt,Ross,I was their first born! They thought she was barren! It’s not my fault.,19
S07E13 Rosita Dies.txt,Ross,Hey.,20
S07E13 Rosita Dies.txt,Monica,Hey!,20
S07E13 Rosita Dies.txt,Phoebe,"Ugh, I hate this year!",20
S07E13 Rosita Dies.txt,Ross,What’s wrong with this year?,20
S07E13 Rosita Dies.txt,Phoebe,"Well okay, it’s already February and I’ve only given two massages and they were both the worst tippers in the world!",20
S07E13 Rosita Dies.txt,Monica,That was me and Ross.,20
S07E13 Rosita Dies.txt,Phoebe,Oh that’s right!,20
S07E13 Rosita Dies.txt,Ross,"Hey, y’know if you want to pick up some extra cash? Some friends of mine made good money doing telemarketing.",20
S07E13 Rosita Dies.txt,Monica,Oh that’s a great idea. You’re really good on the phone.,20
S07E13 Rosita Dies.txt,Ross,What?,21
S07E13 Rosita Dies.txt,Phoebe,"Oh yeah, like you never called!",21
S07E13 Rosita Dies.txt,Supervisor,So basically this is very easy. You read from the script and try to sell as much toner as you possibly can.,22
S07E13 Rosita Dies.txt,Phoebe,"Okay, I can do that! Oh, by the way, I love my office.",22
S07E13 Rosita Dies.txt,Supervisor,I’m the supply manager.,24
S07E13 Rosita Dies.txt,Phoebe,"Umm, okay I would like to talk to you about your toner needs.",24
S07E13 Rosita Dies.txt,Supervisor,We don’t need any toner.,24
S07E13 Rosita Dies.txt,Supervisor,"Okay, what was wrong with that call?",25
S07E13 Rosita Dies.txt,Phoebe,"Oh well, all right…um, no offense, but you were kind of rude.",25
S07E13 Rosita Dies.txt,Supervisor,"They’re always going to tell you they don’t need toner, but that’s okay because whatever they say, you can find the answer to it here in this script.",25
S07E13 Rosita Dies.txt,Phoebe,Oh.,25
S07E13 Rosita Dies.txt,Supervisor,"So, I think you’re ready to sell toner, do you have any last questions?",25
S07E13 Rosita Dies.txt,Ross,Dad?,29
S07E13 Rosita Dies.txt,Ross,"Dad, we-we can’t believe you’re selling the house.",30
S07E13 Rosita Dies.txt,Monica,"Oh, that’s okay, I can’t wait to see everything again! All of the memories…",31
S07E13 Rosita Dies.txt,Monica,I used to love to play restaurant.,31
S07E13 Rosita Dies.txt,Ross,"Yeah, not as much as you used to love to play uncooked batter eater.",31
S07E13 Rosita Dies.txt,Ross,It’s a clown kit! Clown kit!,36
S07E13 Rosita Dies.txt,Ross,What?,37
S07E13 Rosita Dies.txt,Ross,How are you ever going to sell this place?,37
S07E13 Rosita Dies.txt,Ross,No!,38
S07E13 Rosita Dies.txt,Earl,I don’t need any toner.,41
S07E13 Rosita Dies.txt,Phoebe,"I’m hearing what you’re saying, but at our prices everyone needs toner.",41
S07E13 Rosita Dies.txt,Earl,Not me.,41
S07E13 Rosita Dies.txt,Phoebe,May I ask why?,41
S07E13 Rosita Dies.txt,Earl,You wanna know why. You wanna know why?,41
S07E13 Rosita Dies.txt,Phoebe,I surely do!,41
S07E13 Rosita Dies.txt,Earl,"Okay, I don’t need any toner because I’m going to kill myself.",41
S07E13 Rosita Dies.txt,Earl,"Okay, so…no toner today. Thanks anyway, bye-bye.",44
S07E13 Rosita Dies.txt,Phoebe,No-no wait-wait! I can’t just let you hang up! Just please talk to me.,44
S07E13 Rosita Dies.txt,Phoebe,"Yeah! Now, why do you want to kill yourself?",45
S07E13 Rosita Dies.txt,Earl,"It’s just that I uh, have been working for ten years now at this meaningless, dead-end job and nobody here even knows I exist!",45
S07E13 Rosita Dies.txt,Phoebe,Chandler?,45
S07E13 Rosita Dies.txt,Earl,I-I’m sorry?,45
S07E13 Rosita Dies.txt,Phoebe,"No look, I-I’m sure that people know you exist!",45
S07E13 Rosita Dies.txt,Rachel,You will like it!,48
S07E13 Rosita Dies.txt,Joey,No I won’t.,48
S07E13 Rosita Dies.txt,Rachel,You don’t even know!,49
S07E13 Rosita Dies.txt,Joey,"Because, I know what I like and what I don’t like! It’s not the same thing!",49
S07E13 Rosita Dies.txt,Joey,I don’t know why you say that so soon.,51
S07E13 Rosita Dies.txt,Rachel,"Come on Joey, I just bought you a new chair! The most expensive one in the store! Hey, y’know what I was thinking? We could name her Francette.",52
S07E13 Rosita Dies.txt,Joey,Francette? What is she? A couch?,52
S07E13 Rosita Dies.txt,Joey,Poor thing. Cut down in her prime.,53
S07E13 Rosita Dies.txt,Rachel,"Joey, the new chair will be here in an hour. Maybe we should actually move Rosita out of here. Y’know, start the heeling process?",53
S07E13 Rosita Dies.txt,Rachel,That’s weird.,54
S07E13 Rosita Dies.txt,Joey,"No it’s not weird, it’s a miracle!",54
S07E13 Rosita Dies.txt,Rachel,It’s not a miracle Joey! I’m sure there’s some explanation.,54
S07E13 Rosita Dies.txt,Joey,"Oh there is! If you want something enough and your heart is pure, wondrous things can happen!",54
S07E13 Rosita Dies.txt,Rachel,"Joey, I really don’t…",54
S07E13 Rosita Dies.txt,Rachel,Well no.,55
S07E13 Rosita Dies.txt,Joey,Miracle!,55
S07E13 Rosita Dies.txt,Rachel,"No, y’know what? Maybe somebody came in here and fixed it! Or something!",55
S07E13 Rosita Dies.txt,Joey,Someone like an…angel?,55

S07E13 Rosita Dies.txt,Ross,"Well, can you blame her?",58
S07E13 Rosita Dies.txt,Ross,"Dad, dad I don’t want to hear about it.",58
S07E13 Rosita Dies.txt,Ross,"Well, not right now. Okay look, Monica came here for some memories and damnit, we’re gonna give her some! Okay, grab…grab some empty boxes. Okay? We’ll-we’ll take stuff from mine and whatever we can pass off as hers we’ll-we’ll put ‘em in their.",58
S07E13 Rosita Dies.txt,Ross,"Sure! Ooh-ooh, what about this?",61
S07E13 Rosita Dies.txt,Rachel,"Hey, how’s…how’s the uh, miracle chair?",65
S07E13 Rosita Dies.txt,Joey,Fine.,65
S07E13 Rosita Dies.txt,Rachel,"Yeah? Wow! Y’know, that this thing has speakers in the headrest!",65
S07E13 Rosita Dies.txt,Joey,No. Really?,65
S07E13 Rosita Dies.txt,Rachel,Yeah! You can hook it up to your TV and you get radio!,65
S07E13 Rosita Dies.txt,Phoebe,"Wait, what was that? That sounded like someone being nice to you.",69
S07E13 Rosita Dies.txt,Earl,"No! That’s just the ""Hey Guy"" guy. He says that to everybody! He’s the worst! I’d like to take him with me!",69
S07E13 Rosita Dies.txt,Phoebe,"All right so Earl, let’s just forget about the people at the office, okay? There-there’s gotta be someone else in your life worth sticking around for! What about-what about your family, your friends, or maybe your girlfriend?",69
S07E13 Rosita Dies.txt,Phoebe,"Oh sorry, boyfriend!",70
S07E13 Rosita Dies.txt,Earl,Oh no.,70
S07E13 Rosita Dies.txt,Phoebe,"No, whatever! Anything!",70

S07E13 Rosita Dies.txt,Phoebe,No! I’m not finished yet! Don’t! Don’t you dare hang up on me!!!,71

S07E13 Rosita Dies.txt,Ross,"Yeah. Yeah, oh you loved that thing. You always had it with you. You never went anywhere without-without that coloring book.",78
S07E13 Rosita Dies.txt,Ross,"Oh, I don’t know how that got in there.",82
S07E13 Rosita Dies.txt,Ross,"Umm, your boxes are umm…",83
S07E13 Rosita Dies.txt,Monica,What?,83
S07E13 Rosita Dies.txt,Ross,Dad?,83
S07E13 Rosita Dies.txt,Monica,Just mine?,83
S07E13 Rosita Dies.txt,Monica,"So wait, Ross’s stuff is fine, but I have no memories because you wanted to keep the bottom two inches of your car away from water!!!",84
S07E13 Rosita Dies.txt,Rachel,Hey Chandler!,87
S07E13 Rosita Dies.txt,Chandler,Hey!,87
S07E13 Rosita Dies.txt,Rachel,"How would you like to sit in a chair that fully reclines, has a rolling massage, and speakers in the head rest?",87
S07E13 Rosita Dies.txt,Chandler,"Yeah, I’d love to but I’ve tried that so many times they won’t even let me in the store anymore.",87
S07E13 Rosita Dies.txt,Rachel,"Well what if I told you, you can do it in my apartment?",87
S07E13 Rosita Dies.txt,Chandler,That’s awesome! That’s great! What made you do it?!,89
S07E13 Rosita Dies.txt,Rachel,"Well, it’s a long story, but umm I broke Joey’s chair…",89
S07E13 Rosita Dies.txt,Chandler,Whoa-whoa-whoa! You broke Joey’s chair?,89
S07E13 Rosita Dies.txt,Rachel,Yeah.,89
S07E13 Rosita Dies.txt,Chandler,I thought I broke Joey’s chair! That’s why I replaced it with mine!,89
S07E13 Rosita Dies.txt,Rachel,Ohhhhh. That’s how it got fixed!,89
S07E13 Rosita Dies.txt,Chandler,"Well, what did you think, that-that elves came in and fixed it?",89
S07E13 Rosita Dies.txt,Rachel,What? Wh-hey!,91
S07E13 Rosita Dies.txt,Chandler,Joey you broke my chair!!,93
S07E13 Rosita Dies.txt,Joey,Your chair?!,93
S07E13 Rosita Dies.txt,Rachel,"Yeah, he thought he broke your chair so he switched the chairs!",93
S07E13 Rosita Dies.txt,Joey,"So, there was no miracle?!",93
S07E13 Rosita Dies.txt,Rachel,"No Joe, no miracle.",93
S07E13 Rosita Dies.txt,Chandler,I think I should get the chair!,95
S07E13 Rosita Dies.txt,Joey,How do you figure?,96
S07E13 Rosita Dies.txt,Rachel,No-no-no! This chair’s not going anywhere.,97
S07E13 Rosita Dies.txt,Chandler,"Well, where’s the logic in that?!",97
S07E13 Rosita Dies.txt,Rachel,"The logic is, that there are two of us and we are both strong enough to break a chair in half!",97
S07E13 Rosita Dies.txt,Chandler,So Joey breaks my chair and I get nothing!,97
S07E13 Rosita Dies.txt,Joey,That’s right!,98
S07E13 Rosita Dies.txt,Chandler,What are you guys? Like a gang or something?!,98
S07E13 Rosita Dies.txt,Joey,Yeah! We are!,99
S07E13 Rosita Dies.txt,Rachel,We’re the Cobras!,100
S07E13 Rosita Dies.txt,Marge,"Sorry, I don’t know any Earl.",102
S07E13 Rosita Dies.txt,Earl,Phoebe? The lady who sells toner?,104
S07E13 Rosita Dies.txt,Phoebe,"Umm, look it, you-you can’t kill yourself.",104
S07E13 Rosita Dies.txt,Phoebe,No-no I can’t! I can’t let you do it!,105
S07E13 Rosita Dies.txt,Earl,Why?!,105
S07E13 Rosita Dies.txt,Phoebe,Because it was fate that made me call you today!,105
S07E13 Rosita Dies.txt,Earl,I thought it was toner.,105
S07E13 Rosita Dies.txt,Phoebe,"No! Think about it okay? This isn’t even my regular job! Okay? And my first day on the job, you’re my first call! And-and somebody else might’ve hung up on you, but I wouldn’t do that because I know about this stuff. My mom killed herself.",105
S07E13 Rosita Dies.txt,Earl,Really?!,105
S07E13 Rosita Dies.txt,Phoebe,Yes.,105
S07E13 Rosita Dies.txt,Earl,How?,105
S07E13 Rosita Dies.txt,Phoebe,I’m not gonna give you tips! Look don’t you see that this-this…this all came together so that I could stop you from doing this.,105
S07E13 Rosita Dies.txt,Earl,Couldn’t it just be a coincidence?,105
S07E13 Rosita Dies.txt,Phoebe,"No, it’s fate!",105
S07E13 Rosita Dies.txt,Earl,It doesn’t really seem like enough to be fate.,105
S07E13 Rosita Dies.txt,Phoebe,"Oh. Well umm, okay here’s a weird thing. My mother was also a supply manager.",105
S07E13 Rosita Dies.txt,Earl,I’m actually the office manager.,105
S07E13 Rosita Dies.txt,Phoebe,"Oh my God! So was she! And! Get this, okay? Your-your name is Earl, right? Her name was Pearl, P-Earl.",105
S07E13 Rosita Dies.txt,Earl,"Well, was there anything else?!",105
S07E13 Rosita Dies.txt,Earl,Philadelphia.,106
S07E13 Rosita Dies.txt,Phoebe,"Well, y’know I’m wearing layers and it’s warm.",108
S07E13 Rosita Dies.txt,Earl,Yeah-yeah.,108
S07E13 Rosita Dies.txt,Phoebe,"But if—no look, okay. These jerks might not care about you, but the universe does! And that says a lot!",108
S07E13 Rosita Dies.txt,Earl,Yeah.,110
S07E13 Rosita Dies.txt,Ross,All right. I think it was a mouse.,112
S07E13 Rosita Dies.txt,Monica,How do you think I am?! You’ve wrecked all my childhood memories. You love Ross more than me. And I just rubbed a dead mouse on my face!,114
S07E13 Rosita Dies.txt,Monica,"Wait, you’re giving me your Porsche, you’re kidding me right?!",119
S07E13 Rosita Dies.txt,Ross,"Well w-w-w-w-wait, w-wait, wait, wait a minute! I mean a couple of stupid boxes get wet and she gets a Porsche?!",119
S07E13 Rosita Dies.txt,Monica,All right!,120
S07E13 Rosita Dies.txt,Ross,"Well, what about me?! I’m a medical marvel!!",120
S07E13 Rosita Dies.txt,Joey,Oh yeah.,121
S07E13 Rosita Dies.txt,Rachel,Ahhhh….,121
S07E13 Rosita Dies.txt,Rachel,Uh-huh.,122
S07E13 Rosita Dies.txt,Rachel,Hey!,123
S07E13 Rosita Dies.txt,Joey,Hey!,123
S07E13 Rosita Dies.txt,Monica,Do you guys know what happened to Chandler’s barca lounger?,123
S07E13 Rosita Dies.txt,Rachel,"Oh yeah, Joey broke it. Had to get rid of it.",123
S09E12 Phoebes Rats.txt,Chandler,Hey,2
S09E12 Phoebes Rats.txt,Joey,Hey. So where's Mon?,2
S09E12 Phoebes Rats.txt,Chandler,"Oh, she's at home, putting up decorations for Rachel's birthday party tonight.",2
S09E12 Phoebes Rats.txt,Joey,And you're not helping?,2
S09E12 Phoebes Rats.txt,Chandler,"I tried, but apparantly singing ""I will survive"" in a helium voice - not helping.",2
S09E12 Phoebes Rats.txt,Ross,Hey you guys!,3
S09E12 Phoebes Rats.txt,Rachel,"Shhh don't say that loud, Gunther's gonna want to hug me.",4
S09E12 Phoebes Rats.txt,Molly,Hi.,5
S09E12 Phoebes Rats.txt,Ross,"Ooh, somebody's getting a little fussy.",6
S09E12 Phoebes Rats.txt,Joey,"You damn right I am, I've been waiting for a cookie for 7 minutes.",6
S09E12 Phoebes Rats.txt,Rachel,"Ok, you know what, I'm just gonna take her outside.",6
S09E12 Phoebes Rats.txt,Rachel,"OK, thank you.",7
S09E12 Phoebes Rats.txt,Joey,"Yeah, you too.",8
S09E12 Phoebes Rats.txt,Rachel,"Oh, wow, Molly is just great!",9
S09E12 Phoebes Rats.txt,Ross,Yeah.,9
S09E12 Phoebes Rats.txt,Chandler,"Yes, Bravo on the hot nanny.",9
S09E12 Phoebes Rats.txt,Rachel,What? You really think she's hot?,9
S09E12 Phoebes Rats.txt,Chandler,Are you kidding? If I wasn't married she'd be rejecting me right now.,9
S09E12 Phoebes Rats.txt,Rachel,And Joey?,9
S09E12 Phoebes Rats.txt,Joey,How do you think she's doing?,9
S09E12 Phoebes Rats.txt,Rachel,Am I the only one who doesn't think that she's hot? Ross?,9
S09E12 Phoebes Rats.txt,Ross,"Eh, I mean, I mena she's not unattractive but hot? I ....",9
S09E12 Phoebes Rats.txt,Chandler,Now that Rachel's gone?,10
S09E12 Phoebes Rats.txt,Phoebe,"Hey Mike, what's the capital of Peru?",12
S09E12 Phoebes Rats.txt,Mike,Lima.,12
S09E12 Phoebes Rats.txt,Phoebe,"No. It starts with a ""v"" and ends with an ""x"". Helpfully with a ""to"" in the middle.",12
S09E12 Phoebes Rats.txt,Phoebe,What?,13
S09E12 Phoebes Rats.txt,Mike,"OK, I don't want to freak you out or anything, but I think I just saw a rat in your cupboard.",13
S09E12 Phoebes Rats.txt,Mike,"What, is he your pet rat?",14
S09E12 Phoebes Rats.txt,Phoebe,"Well not so much a pet as, you know, an occasional visitor who I put food out for, you know. Kinda like Santa. Except Santa doesn't poop on the plate of cookies.",14
S09E12 Phoebes Rats.txt,Mike,"You can't keep a rat in your appartment! They're extremely unsanitary, and they transmit leptospirosis and hantavirus.",14
S09E12 Phoebes Rats.txt,Phoebe,What are those?,14
S09E12 Phoebes Rats.txt,Mike,I don't know but they don't sound like spa treatments. You have to get rid of it!,14
S09E12 Phoebes Rats.txt,Phoebe,"OK, fine, if it means that much to you I'll get rid of Bob.",14
S09E12 Phoebes Rats.txt,Mike,Thank you.,14
S09E12 Phoebes Rats.txt,Rachel,Hello.,16
S09E12 Phoebes Rats.txt,Gavin,Hello,16
S09E12 Phoebes Rats.txt,Rachel,"Gavin, I just wanted to say thank you again for watching Emma yesterday during the presentation. I really owe you an appology.",16
S09E12 Phoebes Rats.txt,Gavin,For what?,16
S09E12 Phoebes Rats.txt,Rachel,"Well, when we first met, you know, I thought you were pompous and arrogant and obnoxious ...",16
S09E12 Phoebes Rats.txt,Gavin,Is this your first appology?,16
S09E12 Phoebes Rats.txt,Rachel,"No, I just mean that, you know, first impressions don't mean anything. And I-I think you're a really good guy and I'm sorry that I misjudged you.",16
S09E12 Phoebes Rats.txt,Heather,Good morning!,17
S09E12 Phoebes Rats.txt,Gavin,What?,18
S09E12 Phoebes Rats.txt,Rachel,I was giving you an appology and you were totally checking her out!,18
S09E12 Phoebes Rats.txt,Gavin,"I wasn't checking her out. I'm in fashion, I was looking at her skirt. Or was it pants? I didn't really see what happened below the ass area.",18
S09E12 Phoebes Rats.txt,Rachel,"Oh wow, you are really, you're really a creep.",18
S09E12 Phoebes Rats.txt,Gavin,Why do you even care if I was looking at her? Are you jealous?,18
S09E12 Phoebes Rats.txt,Gavin,I thought it was ok when you slept with your old assistant Tag.,19
S09E12 Phoebes Rats.txt,Rachel,"That is totally different for two reasons. One - I didn't know that you knew that. And two, I wasn't some creep staring at his ass, we had a deap meaningful relationship.",19
S09E12 Phoebes Rats.txt,Gavin,Huh. What's Tag's last name?,19
S09E12 Phoebes Rats.txt,Gavin,But it was a deap meaningful relationship.,20
S09E12 Phoebes Rats.txt,Rachel,"Oh, you know what - my first impression of you was absolutely right. You are arrogant, you are pompous ... Morgan! Morgan! Tag's last name was Morgan! Huh!",20
S09E12 Phoebes Rats.txt,Gavin,It was Jones.,20
S09E12 Phoebes Rats.txt,Rachel,"Yeah well what are you, his boyfriend?",20
S09E12 Phoebes Rats.txt,Joey,"Man, I wish I had a nanny like you.",21
S09E12 Phoebes Rats.txt,Molly,"You mean, when you were a baby.",21
S09E12 Phoebes Rats.txt,Joey,Sure.,21
S09E12 Phoebes Rats.txt,Monica,Would you stop staring at her?,22
S09E12 Phoebes Rats.txt,Chandler,I wasn't staring. I was leering.,22
S09E12 Phoebes Rats.txt,Monica,What's the big deal with her? Maybe she's attractive in an obvious kind of way.,22
S09E12 Phoebes Rats.txt,Ross,"Yeah, obvious beauty's the worst. You know, when it's right there in your face. Me, I like to have to work to find someone attractive. Makes me feel like I earned it.",22
S09E12 Phoebes Rats.txt,Chandler,Looks like Joey is doing allright with her.,22
S09E12 Phoebes Rats.txt,Monica,"Yeah. Hey, that was nice of you guys to back off and let Joey get the girl for once.",22
S09E12 Phoebes Rats.txt,Ross,"Ok, I'll be home right after work. Ok, by Emma-Wemma-Demma, I love you - wovyou dovyou ...",23
S09E12 Phoebes Rats.txt,Molly,Bye,23
S09E12 Phoebes Rats.txt,Monica,They've elected me to talk to you about the baby talk - it's not so good.,23
S09E12 Phoebes Rats.txt,Joey,Why not?,25
S09E12 Phoebes Rats.txt,Rachel,"Because it took us months to find a good nanny and I wouldn't want anything to, you know, drive her away.",25
S09E12 Phoebes Rats.txt,Ross,"Come on, there are plenty of other women out thereok? Just - just forget about her, ok? Just, she's off limits.",26
S09E12 Phoebes Rats.txt,Joey,"Oh, man, why did have to go and say that for? Now that you told me I can't have it makes me want her even more!",26
S09E12 Phoebes Rats.txt,Ross,"What are you, a child?",26
S09E12 Phoebes Rats.txt,Joey,Yes!,26
S09E12 Phoebes Rats.txt,Ross,"Joey, come on now, for me! Please, just-just try to focus your sexual energy on someone else.",26
S09E12 Phoebes Rats.txt,Phoebe,Hey Mikey,29
S09E12 Phoebes Rats.txt,Mike,Hey P,29
S09E12 Phoebes Rats.txt,Phoebe,What are you doing?,29
S09E12 Phoebes Rats.txt,Mike,Setting rat traps.,29
S09E12 Phoebes Rats.txt,Phoebe,To kill Bob??,29
S09E12 Phoebes Rats.txt,Mike,"No, no, to test his neck strength.",29
S09E12 Phoebes Rats.txt,Phoebe,"No, Mike, I don't want to kill him! I thought we were just gonna capture him and, and you know, set him free in the country side where he can maybe meet a friendly possom and a wisecracking owl.",29
S09E12 Phoebes Rats.txt,Mike,"Ok, ok, I'll throw away the traps.",29
S09E12 Phoebes Rats.txt,Mike,Better think of a new name for him.,30
S09E12 Phoebes Rats.txt,Phoebe,"I don't know, I kinda like Bob for a girl.",30
S09E12 Phoebes Rats.txt,Phoebe,"Oh my god, we killed Bob!",31
S09E12 Phoebes Rats.txt,Mike,"Maybe it wasn't Bob, maybe it was a mouse.",31
S09E12 Phoebes Rats.txt,Ross,Whazzup??,33
S09E12 Phoebes Rats.txt,Chandler,"Seriously dude, 3 years ago.",33
S09E12 Phoebes Rats.txt,Ross,"Listen, can you do me a favor? I'm gonna be out today. Can you just keep an eye on Joey, make sure nothing happens between him and Molly?",33
S09E12 Phoebes Rats.txt,Chandler,You don't trust him?,33
S09E12 Phoebes Rats.txt,Ross,"Wh - No. Some woman who sounded a lot like Joey called earlier and asked for her daughter, the ""hot nanny"".",33
S09E12 Phoebes Rats.txt,Chandler,"Is this really your long term plan, for me to run interference? Because I could get a job any day now.",33
S09E12 Phoebes Rats.txt,Ross,"You do appear right on the cusp of something. Come on man, I'm sure he'll lose interest in a week or two, but for now can you please just do this for me?",33
S09E12 Phoebes Rats.txt,Chandler,"Allright, fine, but don't blame me if it doesn't work. Because you know as well as I do that once Joey sets his mind on something, more often than not, he's going to have sex with it.",33
S09E12 Phoebes Rats.txt,Chandler,Picturing that tree?,34
S09E12 Phoebes Rats.txt,Ross,"I am, yes.",34
S09E12 Phoebes Rats.txt,Chandler,"Where you going, Joe?",35
S09E12 Phoebes Rats.txt,Joey,For a walk.,36
S09E12 Phoebes Rats.txt,Chandler,Oh. You mind if I join you?,36
S09E12 Phoebes Rats.txt,Joey,"Actually, that will be long. You know, I really need to organize my thoughts.",36
S09E12 Phoebes Rats.txt,Chandler,Your thoughts? Plural?,36
S09E12 Phoebes Rats.txt,Joey,"Allright, fine, I only have one thought! It's about the hot nanny, I gotta see her!",36
S09E12 Phoebes Rats.txt,Chandler,"I'm afraid I can't let you do that, Joe.",36
S09E12 Phoebes Rats.txt,Joey,"Now YOU'RE telling me I can't see her?? You guys are killing me! She's forbidden fruit! It's like ... like she's the princess and I'm the stable boy ... Why are you doing this, huh? Did Ross tell you not to let me go over there?",36
S09E12 Phoebes Rats.txt,Chandler,"Yes, as a matter of fact he did, so I can't let you go.",36
S09E12 Phoebes Rats.txt,Joey,Huh. Interesting. Now there are obstacles. Hot nanny and me against the world. This is the kind of stuff great novels are made of.,36
S09E12 Phoebes Rats.txt,Chandler,Great novels?,36
S09E12 Phoebes Rats.txt,Joey,Fine ... mediocre porn,36
S09E12 Phoebes Rats.txt,Gavin,Gavin Mitchelle's office.,37
S09E12 Phoebes Rats.txt,Rachel,"Um, excuse me Gavin, I have a question I need to ask you.",39
S09E12 Phoebes Rats.txt,Rachel,If you like looking at butts so much why don't you just go look at a mirror?,40
S09E12 Phoebes Rats.txt,Rachel,"Oh, please, I don't care about you enough to bug me. In fact, from now on, I'm going take the high road. And I'm going be very very nice to you, you ""momma's boy"", starting right now.",41
S09E12 Phoebes Rats.txt,Monica,Hey Rach!,42
S09E12 Phoebes Rats.txt,Rachel,Hi!,42
S09E12 Phoebes Rats.txt,Monica,Ready for your birthday lunch?,42
S09E12 Phoebes Rats.txt,Rachel,"Yeah I am, I am! Oh, but first of all, Monica, I would like to introduce you to my very talented colleage and more importantly my wonderful friend Gavin Mitchelle.",42
S09E12 Phoebes Rats.txt,Gavin,Pleased to meet you.,42
S09E12 Phoebes Rats.txt,Monica,Pleased to meet you. So you're coming to Rachel's party tonight?,42
S09E12 Phoebes Rats.txt,Rachel,"Oh no no no no no, Gavin can't, he already has plans, most likely with his mother.",42
S09E12 Phoebes Rats.txt,Rachel,Why did you invite him?? I can't stand that guy!,43
S09E12 Phoebes Rats.txt,Monica,You were just being so nice to him!,43
S09E12 Phoebes Rats.txt,Rachel,I was faking it! Can't you tell when I'm being fake?,43
S09E12 Phoebes Rats.txt,Rachel,"Hey, Mr Philips, nice suit!",44
S09E12 Phoebes Rats.txt,Monica,Right there! That was so fake!,44
S09E12 Phoebes Rats.txt,Rachel,Shh!,44
S09E12 Phoebes Rats.txt,Monica,"Oh, you're welcome for the party. I'm glad you're having a good time.",46
S09E12 Phoebes Rats.txt,Rachel,"God, I hope he doesn't show up. Of course he's not gonna show up, the guy hates me.",46
S09E12 Phoebes Rats.txt,Monica,Does he?,46
S09E12 Phoebes Rats.txt,Rachel,What?,46
S09E12 Phoebes Rats.txt,Monica,Maybe he's bothering you so much because he likes you. It's like in first grade when Skippy Langwild always pushed me on the playground because he secretly had a crush on me?,46
S09E12 Phoebes Rats.txt,Rachel,"Oh, Monica, you think Skippy liked you? Honey, all those buys had a bet to see if he can knock you over.",46
S09E12 Phoebes Rats.txt,Joey,"Hey Rach, so can I sing happy birthday to you now?",50
S09E12 Phoebes Rats.txt,Rachel,"Yeah, sure!",50
S09E12 Phoebes Rats.txt,Monica,"Hey Rach, somebody got you shoes!",51
S09E12 Phoebes Rats.txt,Phoebe,"Be careful, be careful! These are my rat babies!",52
S09E12 Phoebes Rats.txt,Mike,Yeah. We have rat babies now.,52
S09E12 Phoebes Rats.txt,Rachel,"Ahhhh , you brought rats to my birthday party?",52
S09E12 Phoebes Rats.txt,Monica,So this is what a stroke feels like.,52
S09E12 Phoebes Rats.txt,Phoebe,"I had to bring them! We killed their mother, they're our responsibility now. You know, they require constant care. You should know that, Rachel, you're a mother.",52
S09E12 Phoebes Rats.txt,Rachel,Are you comparing my daughter to a rat?,52
S09E12 Phoebes Rats.txt,Phoebe,"No! Seven rats! I think we should take them home, we need feed them.",52
S09E12 Phoebes Rats.txt,Rachel,"whhh wait, you're gonna leave my party to take care of a box of rats?",52
S09E12 Phoebes Rats.txt,Ross,Where the hell are Joey and Molly? I asked you to watch them.,54
S09E12 Phoebes Rats.txt,Ross,We have to stop them before something happens!,55
S09E12 Phoebes Rats.txt,Joey,"So you see, Molly, what people don't understand is that acting is a discipline. It takes a lot of hard work.",57
S09E12 Phoebes Rats.txt,Molly,So where did you study?,57
S09E12 Phoebes Rats.txt,Joey,"Oh, I didn't go to college.",57
S09E12 Phoebes Rats.txt,Molly,"No, where did you study acting?",57
S09E12 Phoebes Rats.txt,Joey,Molly ... people don't study acting ...,57
S09E12 Phoebes Rats.txt,Ross,"Molly, ah, do you mind giving us just a minute?",58
S09E12 Phoebes Rats.txt,Molly,"Sure, I'll go check on Emma.",58
S09E12 Phoebes Rats.txt,Ross,Thanx.,58
S09E12 Phoebes Rats.txt,Ross,"What do you think you're gonna do, have sex with her right here on my couch?",60

S09E12 Phoebes Rats.txt,Mike,"Yeah - not such a problem with rats. No, they're more of a ""love the one you're with"" kind of animals.",68

S05E09 Rosss Sandwich.txt,Joey,I'm surprised you didn't go home wearing your lunch.,23
S05E09 Rosss Sandwich.txt,Phoebe,"Okay, look you wanna hold onto your food? You gotta scare people off. I learned that living on the street.",23
S05E09 Rosss Sandwich.txt,Ross,"Really?! So what would you say Pheebs? Stuff like uh, ""Keep your mitts off my grub?""",23

S05E09 Rosss Sandwich.txt,Phoebe,"Okay, umm, it's this tragic love story between Cathy and Heathcliff and umm, it takes place on like these really creepy mores in England. Which I think represents the wildness of Heathcliff's character. I totally get symbolism.",26
S05E09 Rosss Sandwich.txt,Rachel,"Umm, well I would have to say that it's a, it's tragic love story.",27
S05E09 Rosss Sandwich.txt,Rachel,"Oh-oh-oh, symbolism! And uh, the-the uh, wildness of the mores, which I think is-is mirrored in the wildness of Heathcliff's character.",27
S05E09 Rosss Sandwich.txt,Rachel,"Well, honey that was pretty obvious.",28
S05E09 Rosss Sandwich.txt,Phoebe,Well how would you know?! You didn't even read it!,28
S05E09 Rosss Sandwich.txt,Phoebe,"I think that uh, yours is a question with many answers.",28
S05E09 Rosss Sandwich.txt,Phoebe,Would you care to venture one?,28

S05E09 Rosss Sandwich.txt,Joey,"Well, I'm telling everyone about you! That's the only way to explain the underwear and the video camera that doesn't make me look like a pig!",40
S05E09 Rosss Sandwich.txt,Joey,"Yeah, I like that. But no-no, how does that explain why Rachel found my underwear at your place?",41
S05E09 Rosss Sandwich.txt,Chandler,Oh—I don't know.,41
S05E09 Rosss Sandwich.txt,Joey,"Well, get ready to come out of the non-gay closet!",41

S05E09 Rosss Sandwich.txt,Rachel,"Vogue! Hey, so tell me about this Jane Eyre woman.",56
S05E09 Rosss Sandwich.txt,Phoebe,No! You should've read it yourself!,56
S05E09 Rosss Sandwich.txt,Rachel,Come on Phoebe! Don’t be such a goodie-goodie!,56
S05E09 Rosss Sandwich.txt,Phoebe,"Fine! Okay, all right, so Jane Eyre, first of all, you'd think she's a woman, but she's not. She's a cyborg.",56
S05E09 Rosss Sandwich.txt,Rachel,A cyborg?! Isn't that like a robot?!,56
S05E09 Rosss Sandwich.txt,Phoebe,"Yeah, this book was light years ahead of its time.",56
S05E09 Rosss Sandwich.txt,Phoebe,"Umm, Rachel and I were just discussing it and she had some very interesting insights.",57

S05E09 Rosss Sandwich.txt,Monica,Why?!,62
S05E09 Rosss Sandwich.txt,Ross,On account of my rage.,62
S05E09 Rosss Sandwich.txt,Chandler,"Which I may say, right now, is out of control.",62
S05E09 Rosss Sandwich.txt,Ross,He gave me a pill for it.,62
S05E09 Rosss Sandwich.txt,Monica,A pill?,62
S05E09 Rosss Sandwich.txt,Ross,"Uh-huh. Well, when the psychiatrist told me I had to take a leave of absence because I yelled at my boss I started to get worked up again, so he offered me a tranquilizer. And I thought was a good idea so, I took it.",62
S05E09 Rosss Sandwich.txt,Monica,"Wait a minute, they're making you take time off work?",62
S05E09 Rosss Sandwich.txt,Chandler,And you're okay with that?,62
S05E09 Rosss Sandwich.txt,Ross,"I don't know. It's going to be weird not having a job for a while, but I, I definitely don't care about my sandwich.",62
S05E09 Rosss Sandwich.txt,Rachel,That was not funny!,65
S05E09 Rosss Sandwich.txt,Phoebe,"Well, I snapped! Okay? You weren't taking the class seriously.",65
S05E09 Rosss Sandwich.txt,Rachel,"Phoebe, come on! What is the big deal? I thought this was going to be something we could do together! Y'know, I thought it would be fun!",65
S05E09 Rosss Sandwich.txt,Phoebe,"Well, yeah! Fun is good, but y'know I also wanted to learn. Y'know, people are always talking about what they learned in high school and I never went to high school.",65
S05E09 Rosss Sandwich.txt,Rachel,"Ohh. Oh, so you really wanted to learn. Yeah, y'know, Pheebs I just wanted to have fun. Ohh, you know who you should go with?",65

S05E09 Rosss Sandwich.txt,Chandler,Joey's a sex addict.,77
S05E09 Rosss Sandwich.txt,Monica,It's okay! It's good! It's good. It's a disease!,78
S05E09 Rosss Sandwich.txt,Joey,No! No! I am not a sex addict!,78
S05E09 Rosss Sandwich.txt,Monica,Yes you are! That's the only way to explain all this stuff!,78
S05E09 Rosss Sandwich.txt,Joey,"No it isn't! No, it's not. Because you can also explain it with the truth!",78
S05E09 Rosss Sandwich.txt,Rachel,"Well, what is the truth?",78
S05E09 Rosss Sandwich.txt,Ross,"Yeah, what's going on?",78
S05E09 Rosss Sandwich.txt,Phoebe,What's going on?,78
S05E09 Rosss Sandwich.txt,Chandler,Well let's….let's see what everybody thinks of that?,79
S05E09 Rosss Sandwich.txt,Monica,Oh no!,79
S05E09 Rosss Sandwich.txt,Ross,You slept with my sister?,79
S05E09 Rosss Sandwich.txt,Joey,"Uh yes, but it was, we just did it once uh, in London.",79
S05E09 Rosss Sandwich.txt,Rachel,"Monica, is this true?",80
S05E09 Rosss Sandwich.txt,Joey,Of course it's true! How else would you explain all the weird stuff that's been going on?,80
S05E09 Rosss Sandwich.txt,Monica,Yes it's true.,80
S05E09 Rosss Sandwich.txt,Rachel,"Okay, but if it only happened that one time, how come we found your underwear in our apartment the other day?",80
S05E09 Rosss Sandwich.txt,Joey,Ahh—oy! That was the underwear I was wearing that night in London. Right Monica?,80
S05E09 Rosss Sandwich.txt,Ross,My God Monica!!,81
S05E09 Rosss Sandwich.txt,Chandler,Are you sure Joe? Are you sure you're not just a sex addict?,81

S05E09 Rosss Sandwich.txt,Phoebe,So that's why she gave you a naked picture of herself.,81
S05E09 Rosss Sandwich.txt,Joey,That makes sense!,81
S05E09 Rosss Sandwich.txt,Rachel,And the video camera?,81
S05E09 Rosss Sandwich.txt,Joey,"Uhh, Monica?",81
S05E09 Rosss Sandwich.txt,Monica,I guess I set up the video camera to try and entice Joey.,81
S05E09 Rosss Sandwich.txt,Joey,But sadly I could not be enticed.,81
S05E09 Rosss Sandwich.txt,Ross,Unbelievable! I mean you really kept Joey's underwear?! Why? Why would you do that?!,81
S05E09 Rosss Sandwich.txt,Monica,I'm Monica. I'm disgusting. I stalk guys and keep their underpants.,81
S05E09 Rosss Sandwich.txt,Phoebe,"I really thought you making a good point. I mean y'know, until you got cut off.",83
S05E09 Rosss Sandwich.txt,Phoebe,I don't know! I didn't come with her!,83

S07E23 Chandler And Monicas Wedding.txt,Monica,She’s right there.,178
S07E23 Chandler And Monicas Wedding.txt,Monica,Not now.,182
S07E23 Chandler And Monicas Wedding.txt,Chandler,Okay.,182
S07E23 Chandler And Monicas Wedding.txt,Monica,"Chandler, for so long I…I wondered if I would ever find my prince, my soul mate. Then three years ago, at another wedding I turned to a friend for comfort. And in stead, I found everything that I’d ever been looking for my whole life. And now…here we are…with our future before us…and I only want to spend it with you, my prince, my soul mate, my friend. Unless you don’t want to. You go!",190
S07E23 Chandler And Monicas Wedding.txt,Joey,Chandler?,190
S07E23 Chandler And Monicas Wedding.txt,Joey,"You may not kiss the bride. So, I guess by the powers vested in my by the state of New York and the Internet guys, I now pronounce you husband and wife. Oh wait! Do you take each other?",192

S01E09 Underdog Gets Away.txt,Rachel,"Terry, I, I, I know that I haven't worked here very long, but I was wondering, do you think it would be possible if I got a $100 advance in my salary?",2
S01E09 Underdog Gets Away.txt,Terry,An advance?,2
S01E09 Underdog Gets Away.txt,Rachel,"It's so that I can spend Thanksgiving with my family. See, every year we go skiing in Vail, and normally my father pays for my ticket, but I sort of started the whole independence thing, you know, which is actually why I took this job.",2
S01E09 Underdog Gets Away.txt,Terry,"Rachel, Rachel, sweetheart. You're a terrible, terrible waitress. Really, really awful.",2
S01E09 Underdog Gets Away.txt,Rachel,"Excuse me, sir. Hi, you come in here all time. I was just wondering, do you think there's a possibility that you could give me an advance on my tips?",4
S01E09 Underdog Gets Away.txt,Guy,Huh?,4
S01E09 Underdog Gets Away.txt,Monica,"Hey. Ross, did you know Mom and Dad are going to Puerto Rico for Thanksgiving?",6

S01E09 Underdog Gets Away.txt,Chandler,Hey.,8
S01E09 Underdog Gets Away.txt,Phoebe,Hey.,8
S01E09 Underdog Gets Away.txt,Chandler,And this from the cry-for-help department. Are you wearing makeup?,8
S01E09 Underdog Gets Away.txt,Joey,"Yes, I am. As of today, I am officially Joey Tribbiani, actor slash model.",8
S01E09 Underdog Gets Away.txt,Chandler,"That's so funny, 'cause I was thinking you look more like Joey Tribbiani, man slash woman.",8
S01E09 Underdog Gets Away.txt,Phoebe,What were you modeling for?,8
S01E09 Underdog Gets Away.txt,Joey,You know those posters for the city free clinic?,8

S01E09 Underdog Gets Away.txt,Phoebe,"You know, the asthma guy was really cute.",8
S01E09 Underdog Gets Away.txt,Chandler,Do you know which one you're gonna be?,8
S01E09 Underdog Gets Away.txt,Chandler,"Good luck, man. I hope you get it.",9
S01E09 Underdog Gets Away.txt,Joey,Thanks.,9

S01E09 Underdog Gets Away.txt,Ross,Will you make the mashed potatoes with the lumps?,11
S01E09 Underdog Gets Away.txt,Joey,Yeah.,12
S01E09 Underdog Gets Away.txt,Monica,"And I assume, Chandler, you are still boycotting all the pilgrim holidays.",12
S01E09 Underdog Gets Away.txt,Chandler,"Yes, every single one of them.",12
S01E09 Underdog Gets Away.txt,Monica,"Phoebe, you're gonna be with your grandma?",12
S01E09 Underdog Gets Away.txt,Phoebe,"Yes, and her boyfriend. But we're celebrating Thanksgiving in December 'cause he is lunar.",12
S01E09 Underdog Gets Away.txt,Monica,"So you're free Thursday, then.",12
S01E09 Underdog Gets Away.txt,Phoebe,"Yeah. Oh, can I come?",12
S01E09 Underdog Gets Away.txt,Monica,"Yeah. Rach, are you thinking you're gonna make it to Vail?",12
S01E09 Underdog Gets Away.txt,Rachel,"Absolutely. Shoop, shoop, shoop. Only a hundred and two dollars to go.",12
S01E09 Underdog Gets Away.txt,Chandler,I thought it was $98.50.,12
S01E09 Underdog Gets Away.txt,Rachel,"Yeah, well it was. I, I broke a cup.",12
S01E09 Underdog Gets Away.txt,Ross,"Well, I'm off to Carol's.",12
S01E09 Underdog Gets Away.txt,Phoebe,"Ooh, ooh! Why don't we invite her?",12

S01E09 Underdog Gets Away.txt,Ross,"Oh, I uh, just came by to pick up my skull. Well, not mine, but...Susan: Come in.",14
S01E09 Underdog Gets Away.txt,Ross,"Thanks. Yeah, Carol borrowed it for a class, and I have to get it back to the museum.",14
S01E09 Underdog Gets Away.txt,Susan,What's it look like?,14
S01E09 Underdog Gets Away.txt,Ross,Kinda like a big face without skin.,14
S01E09 Underdog Gets Away.txt,Susan,"Yes, I'm familiar with the concept. We can just look for it.",14
S01E09 Underdog Gets Away.txt,Susan,"Well, you know, you have to take a course. Otherwise, they don't let you do it.",15
S01E09 Underdog Gets Away.txt,Susan,"Actually, I'm reading it to the baby.",16
S01E09 Underdog Gets Away.txt,Ross,"The uh, the baby that hasn't been born yet? Wouldn't that mean you're... crazy?",16
S01E09 Underdog Gets Away.txt,Susan,"What, you don't think they can hear sounds in there?",16
S01E09 Underdog Gets Away.txt,Ross,"You're not serious, I mean, you really... you really talk to it?",16
S01E09 Underdog Gets Away.txt,Susan,"Yeah, all the time. I want the baby to know my voice.",16
S01E09 Underdog Gets Away.txt,Ross,"Do you uh, do you talk about me?",16
S01E09 Underdog Gets Away.txt,Susan,"Yeah, yeah, all the time.",16
S01E09 Underdog Gets Away.txt,Ross,Really?,16
S01E09 Underdog Gets Away.txt,Susan,"But um, we just refer to you as Bobo the Sperm Guy.",16
S01E09 Underdog Gets Away.txt,Ross,"Look, if she's talking to it, I just think that I should get some belly time too. Not that I believe any of this.",17
S01E09 Underdog Gets Away.txt,Phoebe,"Oh, I believe it. I think the baby can totally hear everything. I can show you. Look, this will seem a little weird, but you put your head inside this turkey, and then we'll all talk, and you'll hear everything we say.",17
S01E09 Underdog Gets Away.txt,Chandler,"I'd just like to say that I'm totally behind this experiment. In fact, I'd very much like to butter your head.",17
S01E09 Underdog Gets Away.txt,Monica,"Hey, Rach, did you make your money?",18
S01E09 Underdog Gets Away.txt,Rachel,"No, not even close. Forget Vail, forget seeing my family, forget shoop, shoop, shoop.",18
S01E09 Underdog Gets Away.txt,Monica,"Rach, here's your mail.",18
S01E09 Underdog Gets Away.txt,Rachel,"Thanks, you can just put it on the table.",18
S01E09 Underdog Gets Away.txt,Rachel,"Thanks, you can just put it on the table.",19
S01E09 Underdog Gets Away.txt,Rachel,"Oh my god, oh, you guys are great.",21

S01E09 Underdog Gets Away.txt,Rachel,Thank you. Thank you so much!,23
S01E09 Underdog Gets Away.txt,Rachel,"Wait, wait, Chandler, this is what you're havin' for Thanksgiving dinner? What, what, what is it with you and this holiday?",24
S01E09 Underdog Gets Away.txt,Chandler,"All right, I'm nine years old.",24
S01E09 Underdog Gets Away.txt,Ross,"Oh, I hate this story.",24
S01E09 Underdog Gets Away.txt,Chandler,"We just finished this magnificent Thanksgiving dinner. I have--and I remember this part vividly--a mouthful of pumpkin pie, and this is the moment my parents choose to tell me they're getting divorced.",24
S01E09 Underdog Gets Away.txt,Rachel,Oh my god.,24
S01E09 Underdog Gets Away.txt,Chandler,Yes. It's very difficult to appreciate a Thanksgiving dinner once you've seen it in reverse.,24
S01E09 Underdog Gets Away.txt,Joey,"Uh, hi. We uh, we used to work together.",25
S01E09 Underdog Gets Away.txt,Girl,We did?,25
S01E09 Underdog Gets Away.txt,Girl,"Yeah, right.",26
S01E09 Underdog Gets Away.txt,Joey,I gotta tell you. You're the best in the business.,26
S01E09 Underdog Gets Away.txt,Girl,Get out.,26
S01E09 Underdog Gets Away.txt,Joey,"I'm serious. You're amazing. You know when to spritz, when to lay back.",26
S01E09 Underdog Gets Away.txt,Girl,Really? You don't know what that means to me.,26
S01E09 Underdog Gets Away.txt,Joey,"Ooh, you smell great tonight. What're you wearing?",26
S01E09 Underdog Gets Away.txt,Joey,"Listen, uh, you wanna go get a drink or something?",27
S01E09 Underdog Gets Away.txt,Joey,What's wrong?,28
S01E09 Underdog Gets Away.txt,Girl,"I just remembered, I have to do something.",28
S01E09 Underdog Gets Away.txt,Joey,Oh. What?,28
S01E09 Underdog Gets Away.txt,Girl,"Um, leave.",28
S01E09 Underdog Gets Away.txt,Joey,"Wait, wait, wait!",28
S01E09 Underdog Gets Away.txt,Joey,So I guess you all saw it.,30
S01E09 Underdog Gets Away.txt,Rachel,Saw what?,30
S01E09 Underdog Gets Away.txt,Phoebe,"No, we were just laughing. You know, how laughter can be infectious.",30
S01E09 Underdog Gets Away.txt,Joey,Set another place for Thanksgiving. My entire family thinks I have VD.,31
S01E09 Underdog Gets Away.txt,Chandler,"Tonight, on a very special Blossom.",31
S01E09 Underdog Gets Away.txt,Ross,I don't know. It's just not the same without Mom in the kitchen.,33
S01E09 Underdog Gets Away.txt,Monica,"All right, that's it. You know what? Just get out of my way and stop moping.",33
S01E09 Underdog Gets Away.txt,Ross,That's closer.,33
S01E09 Underdog Gets Away.txt,Rachel,"I got the tickets! I got the tickets! Five hours from now, shoop, shoop, shoop.",34
S01E09 Underdog Gets Away.txt,Chandler,"Oh, you must stop shooping.",34
S01E09 Underdog Gets Away.txt,Rachel,"Ok, I'm gonna get my stuff.",34
S01E09 Underdog Gets Away.txt,Joey,"Chandler, will you just come in already?",34
S01E09 Underdog Gets Away.txt,Chandler,"No, I prefer to keep a safe distance from all this merriment.",34
S01E09 Underdog Gets Away.txt,Phoebe,"Look out, incoming pumpkin pie!",35
S01E09 Underdog Gets Away.txt,Chandler,"Ok, we all laughed when you did it with the stuffing, but that's not funny anymore.",35
S01E09 Underdog Gets Away.txt,Joey,"Hey, Monica, I got a question. I don't see any tater tots.",36
S01E09 Underdog Gets Away.txt,Monica,That's not a question.,36
S01E09 Underdog Gets Away.txt,Joey,"But my mom always makes them. It's like a tradition. You get a little piece of turkey on your fork, a little cranberry sauce, and a tot! It's bad enough I can't be with my family because of my disease.",36
S01E09 Underdog Gets Away.txt,Monica,"All right, fine. Tonight's potatoes will be both mashed with lumps, and in the form of tots.",36
S01E09 Underdog Gets Away.txt,Ross,"Ok, I'm off to talk to my unborn child.",36
S01E09 Underdog Gets Away.txt,Monica,Ah!,37
S01E09 Underdog Gets Away.txt,Ross,"Ok, Mom never hit.",37
S01E09 Underdog Gets Away.txt,Monica,"What, Phoebe, did you whip the potatoes? Ross needs lumps!",39
S01E09 Underdog Gets Away.txt,Phoebe,"Oh, I'm sorry, oh, I just, I thought we could have them whipped and then add some peas and onions.",39
S01E09 Underdog Gets Away.txt,Monica,Why would we do that?,39
S01E09 Underdog Gets Away.txt,Phoebe,"Well, 'cause then they'd be like my mom used to make them, you know, before she died.",39
S01E09 Underdog Gets Away.txt,Monica,"Ok, three kinds of potatoes coming up.",39
S01E09 Underdog Gets Away.txt,Chandler,The most unbelievable thing has happened. Underdog has just gotten away.,41
S01E09 Underdog Gets Away.txt,Joey,The balloon?,41
S01E09 Underdog Gets Away.txt,Chandler,"No, no, the actual cartoon character. Of course the balloon. It's all over the news. Right before he reached Macy's, he broke free and was spotted flying over Washington Square Park. I'm goin' to the roof, who's with me?",41
S01E09 Underdog Gets Away.txt,Rachel,"I can't, I gotta go.",41
S01E09 Underdog Gets Away.txt,Chandler,Come on. An 80-foot inflatable dog let loose over the city. How often does that happen?,41
S01E09 Underdog Gets Away.txt,Phoebe,Almost never.,41
S01E09 Underdog Gets Away.txt,Monica,Got the keys? or Got the keys!,41
S01E09 Underdog Gets Away.txt,Rachel,Ok.,41
S01E09 Underdog Gets Away.txt,Carol,Anytime you're ready.,43
S01E09 Underdog Gets Away.txt,Carol,Just aim for the bump.,44
S01E09 Underdog Gets Away.txt,Ross,"Ok, ok, ok, ok, here goes. You know, I, you know, can't do this. Uh, this is too weird. I feel stupid.",44
S01E09 Underdog Gets Away.txt,Carol,"So don't do it, it's fine. You don't have to do it just because Susan does it.",44
S01E09 Underdog Gets Away.txt,Rachel,I loved the moment when you first saw the giant dog shadow all over the park.,46
S01E09 Underdog Gets Away.txt,Phoebe,"Yeah, but did they have to shoot him down? I mean, that was just mean.",46
S01E09 Underdog Gets Away.txt,Monica,"Ok, right about now the turkey should be crispy on the outside, juicy on the inside. Why are we standing here?",46
S01E09 Underdog Gets Away.txt,Rachel,We're waiting for you to open the door. You got the keys.,46
S01E09 Underdog Gets Away.txt,Monica,No I don't.,46
S01E09 Underdog Gets Away.txt,Rachel,"Yes, you do. When we left, you said, ""got the keys.""",46
S01E09 Underdog Gets Away.txt,Monica,"No I didn't. I asked, ""got the ke-eys?""",46
S01E09 Underdog Gets Away.txt,Rachel,"No, no, no, you said, ""got the keys"".",46
S01E09 Underdog Gets Away.txt,Chandler,Do either of you have the keys?,46
S01E09 Underdog Gets Away.txt,Rachel,"Oh, I gotta get my ticket!",47
S01E09 Underdog Gets Away.txt,Joey,"Wait, wait, we have a copy of your key.",47
S01E09 Underdog Gets Away.txt,Monica,"Well then get it, get it!",47
S01E09 Underdog Gets Away.txt,Joey,That tone will not make me go any faster.,47
S01E09 Underdog Gets Away.txt,Joey,That one will.,48
S01E09 Underdog Gets Away.txt,Ross,"And everyone's telling me, you gotta pick a major, you gotta pick a major. So, on a dare, I picked paleontology. And you have no idea what I'm saying, because, let's face it, you're a fetus. You're just happy you don't have gills anymore.",50
S01E09 Underdog Gets Away.txt,Carol,"Look, you don't have to talk to it. You can sing to it if you want.",50
S01E09 Underdog Gets Away.txt,Ross,"Oh, please. I am not singing to your stomach, ok?",50
S01E09 Underdog Gets Away.txt,Susan,"Hi, how's it goin?",51
S01E09 Underdog Gets Away.txt,Carol,I did.,52
S01E09 Underdog Gets Away.txt,Ross,"Does it always, uh--?",52
S01E09 Underdog Gets Away.txt,Carol,"No, no that was the first.",52
S01E09 Underdog Gets Away.txt,Susan,Keep singing! Keep singing!,52
S01E09 Underdog Gets Away.txt,Susan,I felt it!,53
S01E09 Underdog Gets Away.txt,Joey,"Nope, not that one.",55
S01E09 Underdog Gets Away.txt,Monica,Can you go any faster with that?,55
S01E09 Underdog Gets Away.txt,Joey,"Hey, I got one keyhole and about a zillion keys. You do the math.",55
S01E09 Underdog Gets Away.txt,Monica,Why do you guys have so many keys in there anyway?,55
S01E09 Underdog Gets Away.txt,Monica,I swear you said you had the keys.,57
S01E09 Underdog Gets Away.txt,Rachel,"No, I didn't. I wouldn't say I had the keys unless I had the keys, and I obviously didn't have the keys.",57
S01E09 Underdog Gets Away.txt,Phoebe,"Ooh, ok, that's it. Enough with the keys. No one say keys.",57
S01E09 Underdog Gets Away.txt,Monica,Why would I have the keys?,58
S01E09 Underdog Gets Away.txt,Rachel,Aside from the fact that you said you had them?,58
S01E09 Underdog Gets Away.txt,Monica,But I didn't.,58
S01E09 Underdog Gets Away.txt,Rachel,"Well, you should have.",58
S01E09 Underdog Gets Away.txt,Monica,Why?,58
S01E09 Underdog Gets Away.txt,Rachel,Because!,58
S01E09 Underdog Gets Away.txt,Monica,Why?,58
S01E09 Underdog Gets Away.txt,Rachel,Because!,58
S01E09 Underdog Gets Away.txt,Chandler,"Ok, Monica, only dogs can hear you now, so, look, the door's open. Here we go.",59
S01E09 Underdog Gets Away.txt,Ross,"Here we come, walkin' down the—this doesn't smell like Mom's.",62
S01E09 Underdog Gets Away.txt,Rachel,"Oh, god, this is great! The plane is gone, so it looks like I'm stuck here with you guys.",63
S01E09 Underdog Gets Away.txt,Joey,"Hey, we all had better plans. This was nobody's first choice.",63
S01E09 Underdog Gets Away.txt,Monica,"Oh, really? So why was I busting my ass to make this delicious Thanksgiving dinner?",63
S01E09 Underdog Gets Away.txt,Joey,You call that delicious?,63
S01E09 Underdog Gets Away.txt,Monica,"Stop it, stop it, stop it!",64
S01E09 Underdog Gets Away.txt,Chandler,Now this feels like Thanksgiving.,64
S01E09 Underdog Gets Away.txt,Phoebe,Ooh.,65

S01E09 Underdog Gets Away.txt,Rachel,By all means.,67
S01E09 Underdog Gets Away.txt,Chandler,"Ok, who wants light cheese, and who wants dark cheese?",67
S01E09 Underdog Gets Away.txt,Ross,I don't even wanna know about the dark cheese.,67
S01E09 Underdog Gets Away.txt,Joey,"Oh, I will.",68
S01E09 Underdog Gets Away.txt,Phoebe,"Ooh, you guys have to make a wish.",68
S01E09 Underdog Gets Away.txt,Monica,Make a wish?,68
S01E09 Underdog Gets Away.txt,Phoebe,"Come on, you know, Thanksgiving. Ooh, you got the bigger half. What'd you wish for?",68
S01E09 Underdog Gets Away.txt,Joey,The bigger half.,68
S01E09 Underdog Gets Away.txt,Chandler,"I'd like to propose a toast. Little toast here, ding ding. I know this isn't the kind of Thanksgiving that all of you all planned, but for me, this has been really great, you know, I think because it didn't involve divorce or projectile vomiting. Anyway, I was just thinking, I mean, if you'd gone to Vail, and if you guys'd been with your family, if you didn't have syphilis and stuff, we wouldn't be all together, you know? So I guess what I'm trying to say is that I'm very thankful that all of your Thanksgivings sucked.",68
S01E09 Underdog Gets Away.txt,All,That's so sweet.,68
S01E09 Underdog Gets Away.txt,Ross,"And hey, here's to a lousy Christmas.",68
S01E09 Underdog Gets Away.txt,Rachel,And a crappy New Year.,68

S06E14 Chandler Cant Cry.txt,Rachel,Yeah. And y’know who should’ve shut their drapes? Is that perverted old couple two doors over.,6
S06E14 Chandler Cant Cry.txt,Rachel,Oh don’t even ask!,7
S06E14 Chandler Cant Cry.txt,Chandler,Yuck!,7
S06E14 Chandler Cant Cry.txt,Joey,I can’t believe Ross went out with Rachel’s sister! When Chandler made out with my sister I was mad at him for 10 years.,7
S06E14 Chandler Cant Cry.txt,Chandler,That was like 5 years ago.,7
S06E14 Chandler Cant Cry.txt,Joey,Yeah you got 5 years left!,7
S06E14 Chandler Cant Cry.txt,Chandler,Joey…,7

S06E14 Chandler Cant Cry.txt,Rachel,"So uh, so did anything happen? Because rumor has it you guys shut the drapes!",9

S06E14 Chandler Cant Cry.txt,Ross,Something could’ve happened. All right? She-she really dug my slides. And-and she was definitely giving me the vibe.,10
S06E14 Chandler Cant Cry.txt,Rachel,"Right. Was it the, ""Please don’t show me another picture of a trilobite vibe?""",10
S06E14 Chandler Cant Cry.txt,Ross,"Anyway, if she, if she wasn’t in to me, why-why would she ask me out again?",10

S06E14 Chandler Cant Cry.txt,Ross,"Well umm, oh! I might be teaching another class this semester!",12
S06E14 Chandler Cant Cry.txt,Rachel,"Yeah do it now, call right now.",12
S06E14 Chandler Cant Cry.txt,Phoebe,Oh y’know what’s sadder than this? Bambi. I cried for three days with that movie. No wait two! Because on the third day my mother killed herself so I was partly crying for that.,16
S06E14 Chandler Cant Cry.txt,Chandler,Yes it was very sad when the guy stopped drawing the deer!,18
S06E14 Chandler Cant Cry.txt,Monica,Chandler there’s nothing wrong with crying! I mean you don’t have to be so macho all the time.,18
S06E14 Chandler Cant Cry.txt,Chandler,I’m not macho.,18
S06E14 Chandler Cant Cry.txt,Monica,Yeah you’re right. I don’t know what I was thinking.,18
S06E14 Chandler Cant Cry.txt,Chandler,"No, I guess I just never really cried. Y’know? I’m not a crying kind of guy.",18
S06E14 Chandler Cant Cry.txt,Joey,"Come on man there’s gotta be something that gets you choked up! Like uh, uh oh, what if you saw a three-legged puppy?",18
S06E14 Chandler Cant Cry.txt,Chandler,"I’d be sad sure, but I wouldn’t cry.",18
S06E14 Chandler Cant Cry.txt,Joey,"Okay, what if the puppy said, ""Help me Chandler. All the other puppies pick on me.""",18
S06E14 Chandler Cant Cry.txt,Chandler,"Cry?! I just found a talking puppy, I’m rich!",18
S06E14 Chandler Cant Cry.txt,Chandler,"Oh, that’s Parent’s Day, first grade. That’s me with the janitor Martin.",21
S06E14 Chandler Cant Cry.txt,Monica,Where were your parents?,21
S06E14 Chandler Cant Cry.txt,Chandler,Oh they didn’t want to come!,21
S06E14 Chandler Cant Cry.txt,Phoebe,Oh Chandler!,21
S06E14 Chandler Cant Cry.txt,Monica,Poor thing!,21
S06E14 Chandler Cant Cry.txt,Phoebe,So that story doesn’t make you cry?,21
S06E14 Chandler Cant Cry.txt,Chandler,"No! Look, I don’t cry! It’s not a big deal! Okay?!",21
S06E14 Chandler Cant Cry.txt,Joey,No! It’s not okay! It’s not okay at all!! You’re dead inside!!,21

S06E14 Chandler Cant Cry.txt,Jill,Hey!,29
S06E14 Chandler Cant Cry.txt,Rachel,Hey!,29
S06E14 Chandler Cant Cry.txt,Jill,"You’ll never believe what just happened, Ross just totally blew me off and he didn’t even tell me why!",29
S06E14 Chandler Cant Cry.txt,Rachel,Ohhh well. Y’know what honey? The best thing to do to get over a guy is to start dating someone else. Oh! There is this great guy you will love at work named Bob! He’s a real up-and-comer in Human Resources.,29
S06E14 Chandler Cant Cry.txt,Jill,"Y’know, thanks for trying to cheer me up, but I’m not gonna date some random guy from your work.",29
S06E14 Chandler Cant Cry.txt,Rachel,"It’s not random, it’s Bob.",29
S06E14 Chandler Cant Cry.txt,Jill,It’s probably because not mature enough. Or smart enough. Maybe he doesn’t like the way I dress—No that can’t be it. It’s really gotta be the smart thing. Oh I’m so stupid! I’m just like this incredibly pretty stupid girl!,29
S06E14 Chandler Cant Cry.txt,Rachel,"No honey, okay, okay, you wanna know why Ross canceled the date? Because I asked him to.",29
S06E14 Chandler Cant Cry.txt,Jill,You asked him too?!,29
S06E14 Chandler Cant Cry.txt,Rachel,Hm-mmm.,29
S06E14 Chandler Cant Cry.txt,Jill,Why?!,29
S06E14 Chandler Cant Cry.txt,Rachel,Because you are my sister and Ross and I have this huge history…,29
S06E14 Chandler Cant Cry.txt,Jill,"I don’t understand, do you want to go out with Ross?",29
S06E14 Chandler Cant Cry.txt,Rachel,No.,29
S06E14 Chandler Cant Cry.txt,Jill,"You don’t want him, but you don’t want me to have him?",29
S06E14 Chandler Cant Cry.txt,Rachel,"Look, this is not that big of a deal! You just don’t date Ross! There’s a million other guys out there, you just…",31
S06E14 Chandler Cant Cry.txt,Jill,Hey! You have no right to tell me what to do.,31
S06E14 Chandler Cant Cry.txt,Rachel,I’m not telling you what to do! I am telling you what not to do!,31
S06E14 Chandler Cant Cry.txt,Jill,Why are you so jealous of me?,31
S06E14 Chandler Cant Cry.txt,Rachel,Jill this is not about me being jealous of you! This is about you being a brat! Wanting what you can’t have!,31
S06E14 Chandler Cant Cry.txt,Rachel,"All right, all right, well you just blew your chances at dating Bob!",32
S06E14 Chandler Cant Cry.txt,Jill,Who?!,32

S06E14 Chandler Cant Cry.txt,Chandler,You didn’t get more movies that are gonna have us reaching for the tissues all night did you?,35
S06E14 Chandler Cant Cry.txt,Joey,Sort of…,36
S06E14 Chandler Cant Cry.txt,Monica,"Guys, what’s going on?",36

S06E14 Chandler Cant Cry.txt,Joey,Well down at the adult video place down on Bleaker.,38
S06E14 Chandler Cant Cry.txt,Rachel,"Wow! I mean, I just—I can’t, I can’t believe this. Y’know, I mean you think you know someone even, even Phoebe who’s always been somewhat of a question mark.",39
S06E14 Chandler Cant Cry.txt,Monica,"This is so bizarre. I guess it kinda makes sense though, y’know she had such a terrible childhood.",39
S06E14 Chandler Cant Cry.txt,Chandler,"Hey, I had a terrible childhood and I don’t do porn.",39
S06E14 Chandler Cant Cry.txt,Monica,"Yes, but you are dead inside.",39
S06E14 Chandler Cant Cry.txt,Joey,"All right well, I’d better take that back.",39

S06E14 Chandler Cant Cry.txt,Ross,Yeah! Good for you Joe!,40

S06E14 Chandler Cant Cry.txt,Monica,Why are you reading this? You hate this kind of stuff.,49
S06E14 Chandler Cant Cry.txt,Chandler,"Yeah I know, but I figured a shot y’know? Maybe one of those stories would make me cry and then you wouldn’t think I was y’know, all dead inside.",49
S06E14 Chandler Cant Cry.txt,Monica,"Oh that’s so sweet! Look Chandler I don’t care if you can’t cry, I love you.",49
S06E14 Chandler Cant Cry.txt,Chandler,Oh that makes me feel so warm in my hollow tin chest.,49
S06E14 Chandler Cant Cry.txt,Monica,Stop it!,49
S06E14 Chandler Cant Cry.txt,Chandler,Yeah?,51
S06E14 Chandler Cant Cry.txt,Monica,"Yeah! And if, and if we have a baby one-day, and the doctor hands it to you in the delivery room and you don’t cry, so what! And-and-and, and if we take him to college and come home and see his empty room for the first time, and you got nothing, it won’t matter to me.",51
S06E14 Chandler Cant Cry.txt,Chandler,"Okay, well I won’t uh, worry about this anymore then.",51
S06E14 Chandler Cant Cry.txt,Monica,"And-and-and if I die, from a long illness. And you’re writing out my eulogy and you open a desk drawer and you find a note from me that says, ""I will always be with you,"" and you still can’t shed one tiny tear, I know you’ll be crying a river inside.",51
S06E14 Chandler Cant Cry.txt,Chandler,"Aww, I love you so…",51
S06E14 Chandler Cant Cry.txt,Monica,What is wrong with you?!!!,51
S06E14 Chandler Cant Cry.txt,Chandler,What?!,51

S06E14 Chandler Cant Cry.txt,Chandler,So you didn’t mean any of that?!,51
S06E14 Chandler Cant Cry.txt,Monica,No you robot!!,51
S06E14 Chandler Cant Cry.txt,Jill,"Rachel and I had a really big fight, can I come in? I-I mean I know we’re not supposed to see each other anymore and I’m okay with that, it’s just that I don’t know anybody in the city and I really need somebody to talk to about it.",53
S06E14 Chandler Cant Cry.txt,Ross,"Okay, umm…",55
S06E14 Chandler Cant Cry.txt,Jill,But you know what might really cheer me up?,55
S06E14 Chandler Cant Cry.txt,Ross,What?,55
S06E14 Chandler Cant Cry.txt,Jill,Seeing some more of your super-cool slides.,55
S06E14 Chandler Cant Cry.txt,Ross,Wow! Really?!,55
S06E14 Chandler Cant Cry.txt,Jill,"Totally, I love them! And, maybe you could finish telling me about all the different kinds of sand.",55
S06E14 Chandler Cant Cry.txt,Ross,"Well, I’d love to! Here, you wait right here and I’ll go get the projector and my notes!",55
S06E14 Chandler Cant Cry.txt,Jill,"Oh great! Thanks Ross, you’re such a good friend!",55
S06E14 Chandler Cant Cry.txt,Ross,Ohh!,55
S06E14 Chandler Cant Cry.txt,Rachel,Hey! Have you guys seen Jill? I can’t find her anywhere.,56
S06E14 Chandler Cant Cry.txt,Monica,"No, I haven’t.",56
S06E14 Chandler Cant Cry.txt,Rachel,"Well, is Ross home? Maybe I’ll just call him to see if he’s actually seen her.",56
S06E14 Chandler Cant Cry.txt,Ursula,Who is it?,58
S06E14 Chandler Cant Cry.txt,Phoebe,It’s Phoebe! Phoebe!,58

S06E14 Chandler Cant Cry.txt,Phoebe,And-and you’re using my name!,61
S06E14 Chandler Cant Cry.txt,Ursula,"Yeah, can I help you with something?",61
S06E14 Chandler Cant Cry.txt,Phoebe,"Look, I’m talking right now! You’re—you mean her.",61
S06E14 Chandler Cant Cry.txt,Ursula,"Y’know, twin stuff is always a real big seller.",61
S06E14 Chandler Cant Cry.txt,Phoebe,What?!,61
S06E14 Chandler Cant Cry.txt,Ursula,"Yeah, I can talk them into giving you like, 30 dollars.",61
S06E14 Chandler Cant Cry.txt,Ross,Slides are almost ready.,63
S06E14 Chandler Cant Cry.txt,Jill,"Yeah. Ooh, I know what this is missing! Alcohol!",63
S06E14 Chandler Cant Cry.txt,Ross,"Uh okay, well there’s-there’s wine in the kitchen.",63
S06E14 Chandler Cant Cry.txt,Ross,"O-okay, Rach calm-calm down, okay? She-she’s really upset we’re just talking.",66
S06E14 Chandler Cant Cry.txt,Rachel,Ross! I think she is trying to make something happen with you to get back at me!,66
S06E14 Chandler Cant Cry.txt,Ross,So that’s the only reason she could be here huh? It couldn’t have anything to do with the fact that-that maybe I’m a good listener and I uh I put on a great slide show!,66
S06E14 Chandler Cant Cry.txt,Rachel,"Ross, I am telling you that she is using you to get back at me!",66
S06E14 Chandler Cant Cry.txt,Phoebe,Hey!,69
S06E14 Chandler Cant Cry.txt,Joey,Hey!,69
S06E14 Chandler Cant Cry.txt,Phoebe,"So, I just came from the company Ursula works for.",69
S06E14 Chandler Cant Cry.txt,Joey,"Oh no, not you too!",69
S06E14 Chandler Cant Cry.txt,Phoebe,No! No! I just went to pick up Phoebe Buffay’s checks; there were a lot of them.,69
S06E14 Chandler Cant Cry.txt,Joey,Nice!,69
S06E14 Chandler Cant Cry.txt,Phoebe,"Um-mmm, and I won’t have to go there anymore because I gave them my correct address.",69
S06E14 Chandler Cant Cry.txt,Joey,"That’s great, but isn’t it gonna bother that people still think you’re a porn star?",69
S06E14 Chandler Cant Cry.txt,Phoebe,Oh no! No! I know how to handle it.,69
S06E14 Chandler Cant Cry.txt,Joey,You do?,69
S06E14 Chandler Cant Cry.txt,Joey,Yeah.,70
S06E14 Chandler Cant Cry.txt,Chandler,Hey.,71
S06E14 Chandler Cant Cry.txt,Rachel,Oh! I knew it! What happened?,72
S06E14 Chandler Cant Cry.txt,Ross,"Umm, she kissed me.",72
S06E14 Chandler Cant Cry.txt,Rachel,What?! You kissed!,72
S06E14 Chandler Cant Cry.txt,Ross,"Look, I uh, I tried not to kiss her, okay?",74
S06E14 Chandler Cant Cry.txt,Rachel,"Well, it doesn’t sound like it! I mean, it’s pretty easy not to kiss someone, you just don’t kiss them! See look at us, right now, not kissing!",74
S06E14 Chandler Cant Cry.txt,Ross,"Let me finish, okay? She started kissing me and-and I didn’t stop it. I guess I-I just wasn’t thinking…",74
S06E14 Chandler Cant Cry.txt,Ross,Oh wait—hold it! But then I started thinking and I stopped the kissing.,75
S06E14 Chandler Cant Cry.txt,Rachel,"Oh, well thank you for taking your tongue out of my sister’s mouth long enough to tell me that.",75
S06E14 Chandler Cant Cry.txt,Ross,Look I-I realize if anything were to happen with me and Jill then nothing could ever happen with us!,75
S06E14 Chandler Cant Cry.txt,Rachel,What?!,75
S06E14 Chandler Cant Cry.txt,Ross,"No, I mean, look I don’t know if anything is going to happen with us, again. Ever. But I don’t want to know that it-it never could. So I stopped it and she got mad and broke my projector.",75
S06E14 Chandler Cant Cry.txt,Monica,Oh my God! Are-are you crying?,78
S06E14 Chandler Cant Cry.txt,Jill,"All right, I’m leaving! Because I’m not going to spend one more day with someone whose out to sabotage my every move. That’s you Rachel!",80
S06E14 Chandler Cant Cry.txt,Rachel,"Yeah, I got that.",80

S03E03 The Jam.txt,Ross,"Aww, is it broken?",6
S03E03 The Jam.txt,Rachel,Did you tell the doctor you did it jumping up and down on your bed?,7
S03E03 The Jam.txt,Joey,Nooo. I had a story all worked out but then Chandler sold me out.,7
S03E03 The Jam.txt,Chandler,"Well, I'm sorry Joe. I didn't think the doctor was gonna buy that it just *fell* out of the socket.",7
S03E03 The Jam.txt,Joey,What is this? Fruit?,7
S03E03 The Jam.txt,Rachel,Monica's making jam.,7
S03E03 The Jam.txt,Chandler,Because the kids need new shoes.,8
S03E03 The Jam.txt,Joey,This will just be my batch.,9
S03E03 The Jam.txt,Guy,"You wouldn't return my calls, you sent back my letters....",11
S03E03 The Jam.txt,Phoebe,What?,11
S03E03 The Jam.txt,Guy,"One more chance Ursula, please?",11
S03E03 The Jam.txt,Phoebe,"Oooh. Oh, well this is awkward.",11
S03E03 The Jam.txt,Guy,Wh..,11
S03E03 The Jam.txt,Phoebe,"Um, yeah, you want Ursula, and I'm Phoebe. Twin sisters! Seriously.",11
S03E03 The Jam.txt,Guy,"Oh, that's great. I'm stalking the wrong woman. I am such a dingus!",11
S03E03 The Jam.txt,Phoebe,"Oh, you're not a dingus.",11
S03E03 The Jam.txt,Guy,"I just, I want you to know I didn't used to be like this. Before I meet your sister I was like this normal guy who sold beepers and cellular phones.",11
S03E03 The Jam.txt,Phoebe,"Well, I mean look it's, it's not your fault, you know. I mean this is just what, what she does to guys, okay.",11
S03E03 The Jam.txt,Guy,Not really.,13

S03E03 The Jam.txt,Ross,It's an empty apartment.,17

S03E03 The Jam.txt,Ross,We're all alone in an empty apartment.,17
S03E03 The Jam.txt,Ross,There it is.,19
S03E03 The Jam.txt,Ross,Hey.,20
S03E03 The Jam.txt,Chandler,Do I look fat?,20
S03E03 The Jam.txt,Chandler,"Okay, I accept that. When Janice asked me and I said no, she took that to mean that I was calling her a cow.",20
S03E03 The Jam.txt,Rachel,"Okay, walk us through it, honey, walk us through it.",20
S03E03 The Jam.txt,Chandler,"Okay, well. Janice said 'Hi, do I look fat today?' And I, I looked at her....",20
S03E03 The Jam.txt,Ross,"Whoa, whoa, whoa. You looked at her. You never look. You just answer, it's just a reflex. Do I look fat? Nooo! Is she prettier than I am? Noo! Does size matter?",20
S03E03 The Jam.txt,Rachel,Nooo!,20
S03E03 The Jam.txt,Ross,And it works both ways.,20
S03E03 The Jam.txt,Chandler,"Okay, so you both just know this stuff?",20
S03E03 The Jam.txt,Rachel,"Well you know, after about thirty or forty fights, you kinda catch on.",20
S03E03 The Jam.txt,Ross,"Okay, for instance. Let's say, Janice is coming back from a trip and she gives you two options. Option number 1 she'll take a cab home from the airport. Option 2 is you can meet her at baggage claim. Which do you do?",20
S03E03 The Jam.txt,Chandler,"That's easy, baggage claim.",20
S03E03 The Jam.txt,Chandler,"Okay, this is good, this is good. All right listen, I have one. Janice likes to cuddle, at night, which, you know I'm all for. But, uh, you know when you want to go to sleep, you want some space. So, uh, how do I tell her that without, you know, accidentally calling her fat or something.",21
S03E03 The Jam.txt,Ross,Oh.,22
S03E03 The Jam.txt,Rachel,All right are you guys gonna come down?,22
S03E03 The Jam.txt,Ross,"Uh, yeah, yeah I'll, I'm right behind you.",22

S03E03 The Jam.txt,Chandler,"Well, I thought you guys were cuddlily sleepers.",23
S03E03 The Jam.txt,Ross,I'm gonna use the cushion.,25
S03E03 The Jam.txt,Chandler,Yeah.,25
S03E03 The Jam.txt,Chandler,"Okay, the old hug and roll.",26
S03E03 The Jam.txt,Ross,Yep.,26
S03E03 The Jam.txt,Chandler,"Okay, one question.",26
S03E03 The Jam.txt,Ross,Shoot.,26
S03E03 The Jam.txt,Chandler,You're pretending the pillow's a girl right?,26
S03E03 The Jam.txt,Joey,Remember when you where a kid and your Mom would drop you off at the movies with a jar of jam and a little spoon?,27
S03E03 The Jam.txt,All,"Hey, Phoebe.",29
S03E03 The Jam.txt,Phoebe,"Hey, oh, you know that guy who's been following me? I talked to him today.",29
S03E03 The Jam.txt,Phoebe,"Okay, first I'm not crazy. And second, say it don't spray it. Anyway his name is Malcom, and he wasn't following me, I mean he was, but 'cause he thought I was Ursula, ick. And, that's why, that's why he couldn't just come up and talk to me. 'Cause of the restraining order.",30
S03E03 The Jam.txt,Chandler,"Umm, not feeling better 'bout Malcom.",30
S03E03 The Jam.txt,Phoebe,"Ooh! No, no, no, no, he's not like a kook, no. He's just like this, this very passionate, incredibly romantic guy, that got like a tinsy bit carried away, you know. And we just get along really well, and he's so cute.",30
S03E03 The Jam.txt,Ross,"Oh my God, you've got a crush on your sister's stalker.",30
S03E03 The Jam.txt,Phoebe,"No, I'm just gonna help him, you know, get 'de-Ursula-ized', like you know, like I did for Joey after he went out with her.",30
S03E03 The Jam.txt,Phoebe,"Okay, I asked for the news, not the weather.",31
S03E03 The Jam.txt,All,Hey Mon.,32
S03E03 The Jam.txt,Joey,Put your hands together.,35
S03E03 The Jam.txt,Monica,"Joey, take your time with that. That's my last batch.",35
S03E03 The Jam.txt,Joey,No more jam?!,35
S03E03 The Jam.txt,Rachel,"Well, what happened to your jam plan?",35
S03E03 The Jam.txt,Monica,"I figured out I need to charge seventeen bucks a jar just to break even. So, I've got a new plan now. Babies.",35
S03E03 The Jam.txt,Chandler,"Well, your gonna need much bigger jars.",35
S03E03 The Jam.txt,Ross,What are you talking about?,35
S03E03 The Jam.txt,Monica,I'm talking about me having a baby.,35
S03E03 The Jam.txt,Ross,What?,35
S03E03 The Jam.txt,Rachel,Are you serious?,35
S03E03 The Jam.txt,Monica,"Yeah. The great thing about the jam plan was, I was taking control of my life. So I asked myself, what is the most important thing to me in the world and that's when I came up with the baby plan.",35
S03E03 The Jam.txt,Ross,"Well, aren't you forgetin' something? What, what, what is uh, what is that guy's name? Dad!",35
S03E03 The Jam.txt,Monica,"It took me 28 years to find one man that I wanna spend my life with, if I have to wait another 28 years then, I'll be 56 before I can have a baby, and that's just stupid.",35
S03E03 The Jam.txt,Chandler,"That, that's what's stupid.",35
S03E03 The Jam.txt,Monica,"I don't need an actual man, just a couple of his best swimmers. And there, there are places you can go to get that stuff.",35
S03E03 The Jam.txt,Rachel,Down at the docks again?,35
S03E03 The Jam.txt,Janice,Night-night Bing-a-ling.,36
S03E03 The Jam.txt,Malcom,Here's my binoculars.,38
S03E03 The Jam.txt,Phoebe,"Oh, great. Great. You're doing great, you know real strong. Going strong. Keep going.",38
S03E03 The Jam.txt,Malcom,"These are my night vision goggles. This is the book I pretend to read when I'm watching her in the park. And these are Mad Lips, they're just for fun.",38
S03E03 The Jam.txt,Malcom,"Oh, this is log I kept, recording her every movement. Do you wanna here something from it?",39
S03E03 The Jam.txt,Phoebe,"Um, not even a little bit.",39
S03E03 The Jam.txt,Malcom,It's about you.,39
S03E03 The Jam.txt,Phoebe,"Oh, okay then.",39
S03E03 The Jam.txt,Phoebe,Good. So what were you thinking?,40
S03E03 The Jam.txt,Malcom,I was thinking what it would be like to kiss you.,40
S03E03 The Jam.txt,Phoebe,Really?,40
S03E03 The Jam.txt,Malcom,No.,40
S03E03 The Jam.txt,Phoebe,Oh.,40
S03E03 The Jam.txt,Malcom,"See that's just something I said now, so that maybe I could kiss you.",40
S03E03 The Jam.txt,Chandler,"No, that's all right. I just had a jar of mustard.",42
S03E03 The Jam.txt,Chandler,You mean there's more than one of us.,43
S03E03 The Jam.txt,Ross,"Look, you can't do this Mon. All right, if you do this, I'm, I'm gonna, I'm, I'm gonna.....",43
S03E03 The Jam.txt,Monica,You're gonna what?,43
S03E03 The Jam.txt,Ross,I'm gonna tell Mom.,43
S03E03 The Jam.txt,Rachel,"Honey, I'm sorry, but he's right. I love you, but you're crazy.",43
S03E03 The Jam.txt,Ross,Crazy.,43
S03E03 The Jam.txt,Monica,What?! Why? Why is this crazy? So this isn't the ideal way to something....,43
S03E03 The Jam.txt,Monica,"Lips moving, still talking. I mean it may not be ideal, but I'm so ready. No, I-I-I see the way Ben looks at you. It makes me ache, you know?",44
S03E03 The Jam.txt,Joey,Check it out!! Jam crackers!,44
S03E03 The Jam.txt,Joey,"Yeah, the Knicks rule!",45
S03E03 The Jam.txt,Monica,"Joey, this is you!",45
S03E03 The Jam.txt,Rachel,When did you go to a sperm bank?,46
S03E03 The Jam.txt,Chandler,And that's how you bought it?,47
S03E03 The Jam.txt,Joey,"Noooo, that's what I was wearing when I donated. I'm kinda surprised there's any of my boys left.",47
S03E03 The Jam.txt,Monica,"Well, honey, it is pretty competitive. I mean I've got an actual rocket scientist here.",47
S03E03 The Jam.txt,Joey,"Maybe, I should call this place and get them to put my 'Days of Our Lives' on here. You know, juice this puppy up a little.",47
S03E03 The Jam.txt,All,Hey.,48
S03E03 The Jam.txt,Ross,How's the maniac?,48
S03E03 The Jam.txt,Phoebe,"Oh, well he's yummy. We did a little kissin'.",48
S03E03 The Jam.txt,Rachel,"Phoebe, what are you doing?",48
S03E03 The Jam.txt,Phoebe,"Oh, no, no, no, no. You know what, he's not into that stuff anymore. He quit for me.",48
S03E03 The Jam.txt,Rachel,"Pheebs, this guy has been obsessed with your sister, for God knows how long, okay, you don't just give up something like that.",48
S03E03 The Jam.txt,Phoebe,"Look, he gave me his night vision goggles and everything.",48
S03E03 The Jam.txt,Ross,You're taking the word of a guy who has night vision goggles?,48
S03E03 The Jam.txt,Phoebe,"What, he's not still following her. Do you think he is still following her?",48
S03E03 The Jam.txt,Chandler,"Pheebs, wake up and smell the restraining order.",48
S03E03 The Jam.txt,Phoebe,What are you saying I should do?,48
S03E03 The Jam.txt,Monica,"I think, that if you really like this guy, you should just trust him.",48
S03E03 The Jam.txt,Phoebe,"Thank you, Monica.",48
S03E03 The Jam.txt,Joey,"Orrr, you could follow him and see where he goes.",48
S03E03 The Jam.txt,Monica,"Oh, that's what I would do, forget mine.",48
S03E03 The Jam.txt,Janice,"Oh. God, crazy Chandler. He spun me...off...the...bed!",50
S03E03 The Jam.txt,Rachel,Wow! Spinning that sounds like fun.,50
S03E03 The Jam.txt,Janice,"You know what, where he hugs you and kinda rolls you away and... Oh... my....God.",52
S03E03 The Jam.txt,Malcom,Phoebe?,53
S03E03 The Jam.txt,Phoebe,Yes? Yes! Oh.,53
S03E03 The Jam.txt,Malcom,What are you doing?,53
S03E03 The Jam.txt,Malcom,Were you following me?,54
S03E03 The Jam.txt,Phoebe,"Um, perhaps. Yes! Yes, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I was just afraid that you were still hung up on my sister.",54
S03E03 The Jam.txt,Phoebe,"Oh well, what do you know, there goes my identical twin sister. Just walkin' along looking like me. What, is this just like a freakish coincidence, or did you know she takes this train?",55
S03E03 The Jam.txt,Malcom,"I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I tried to stop, but I couldn't. I'm so pathetic.",55
S03E03 The Jam.txt,Malcom,"Uh-huh, I don't know.",56
S03E03 The Jam.txt,Phoebe,"Yeah, just, okay, look I'm going. Um, come on. Op, op, behind the pillar, which way am I gonna go?",56
S03E03 The Jam.txt,Joey,Hey.,57
S03E03 The Jam.txt,Monica,Hey.,57
S03E03 The Jam.txt,Joey,Where you going?,57
S03E03 The Jam.txt,Monica,To the bank.,57
S03E03 The Jam.txt,Joey,Sperm or regular?,57
S03E03 The Jam.txt,Monica,Sperm.,57
S03E03 The Jam.txt,Joey,"So you're really doing this, huh?",57
S03E03 The Jam.txt,Monica,"Oh yeah, picked a guy, 37135.",57
S03E03 The Jam.txt,Joey,Sounds nice.,57
S03E03 The Jam.txt,Monica,"'Fraid so. Brown hair, green eyes...",57
S03E03 The Jam.txt,Joey,"No kiddin', hmm.",57
S03E03 The Jam.txt,Monica,What?,57
S03E03 The Jam.txt,Joey,"No, I-I figured you would've picked a blond guy.",57
S03E03 The Jam.txt,Monica,Really? Why?,57
S03E03 The Jam.txt,Joey,"I don't know, I just always pictured you ending up with one of those tall, smart blond guys, name like.... Hoyt.",57
S03E03 The Jam.txt,Monica,Hoyt?,57
S03E03 The Jam.txt,Joey,"It's a name, yeah. I saw you, you know, in this great house with a big pool.",57
S03E03 The Jam.txt,Monica,"Really, is he a swimmer?",57
S03E03 The Jam.txt,Joey,He's got the body for it.,57
S03E03 The Jam.txt,Joey,"You guys have one of those signs that says: 'We don't swim in your toilet, so don't pee in our pool.', you know.",58
S03E03 The Jam.txt,Monica,We do not have one of those signs.,58
S03E03 The Jam.txt,Joey,"Sure you do, it was a gift from me. Oh! And you have these three great kids.",58
S03E03 The Jam.txt,Monica,Two girls and a boy?,58
S03E03 The Jam.txt,Joey,Yeah!,58
S03E03 The Jam.txt,Monica,"And, and, and they wear those little water wings, you know. And they're, they're running around on the deck. Then Hoyt wraps this big towel around all three of them.",58
S03E03 The Jam.txt,Monica,Yeah.,59
S03E03 The Jam.txt,Rachel,Yeah.,64
S03E03 The Jam.txt,Rachel,Hello.,65
S03E03 The Jam.txt,Chandler,Sure. What's up?,66
S08E15 The Birthing Video.txt,Phoebe,"Oh! Hey, Rach!",2
S08E15 The Birthing Video.txt,Rachel,"Hi! Hey, Happy Valentine’s Day!",2
S08E15 The Birthing Video.txt,Phoebe,"Oh, you, too.",2
S08E15 The Birthing Video.txt,Joey,"Hey, so, uh, how’s it going living over at Ross’?",2
S08E15 The Birthing Video.txt,Phoebe,Okay.,3
S08E15 The Birthing Video.txt,Joey,Bye.,3
S08E15 The Birthing Video.txt,Joey,There’s one lucky to-go cup of coffee.,4
S08E15 The Birthing Video.txt,Joey,Thanks. But maybe later.,5
S08E15 The Birthing Video.txt,Phoebe,"Oh, Gunther, can I get a scone?",5
S08E15 The Birthing Video.txt,Joey,You know what I want? I want a lot of things! I want to be with the woman I love on Valentine’s Day! And I want her to love me back! And I want just one moment of relief from the gut-wrenching pain of knowing that that’s never going to happen!,6
S08E15 The Birthing Video.txt,Gunther,We have red bagels.,6
S08E15 The Birthing Video.txt,Joey,"Oh, okay.",6
S08E15 The Birthing Video.txt,Phoebe,"So, how does Mona feel about you and Rachel living together?",7
S08E15 The Birthing Video.txt,Ross,"Oh, I’m actually on my way to tell her right now. Yeah, she’s been away all week visiting her parents, but she’ll be cool. I mean, she’s been so supportive. She-she even got the baby a tiny T-shirt that says, ‘Fossils are my friends.’",7
S08E15 The Birthing Video.txt,Phoebe,"Ugh. Come on, Mona, don’t kiss ass.",7
S08E15 The Birthing Video.txt,Ross,"Uh, I’m going to take off.",7
S08E15 The Birthing Video.txt,Phoebe,"All right. Oh! Shoot! Oh shoot! Uh, Rachel wanted to see this tape!",7
S08E15 The Birthing Video.txt,Ross,What is it?,7
S08E15 The Birthing Video.txt,Phoebe,It’s a video of my friend giving birth. Could you just bring it back to your apartment?,7
S08E15 The Birthing Video.txt,Phoebe,"Yeah. Candy’s the mother, Cookie’s the daughter. The father’s also Cookie. Why am I friends with these people?",8
S08E15 The Birthing Video.txt,Phoebe,"Oh, Monica, grow up!",9
S08E15 The Birthing Video.txt,Ross,"Hey, what’s behind your back?",9
S08E15 The Birthing Video.txt,Monica,Nothing. Just something I want to get Phoebe’s opinion on for Valentine’s Day.,9
S08E15 The Birthing Video.txt,Ross,You don’t want my opinion?,9
S08E15 The Birthing Video.txt,Monica,Not really.,9
S08E15 The Birthing Video.txt,Ross,"Come on, I’m your older brother, ask me!",9
S08E15 The Birthing Video.txt,Joey,"No, I’m not sleeping with your friend Jane again.",13
S08E15 The Birthing Video.txt,Phoebe,He-hee!,14
S08E15 The Birthing Video.txt,Joey,"Hey! A dog! Hi! Who, you got to admit, looks a lot like Jane.",14
S08E15 The Birthing Video.txt,Phoebe,"This is the happiest dog in the world. I borrowed him from my friend Wendy. Now, you can only keep him until he cheers you up. And he will cheer you up!",14
S08E15 The Birthing Video.txt,Chandler,Happy Valentine’s!,16
S08E15 The Birthing Video.txt,Chandler,"I love you, St. Valentine.",19
S08E15 The Birthing Video.txt,Chandler,"Woah, woah, that’s not pretty!",20
S08E15 The Birthing Video.txt,Chandler,I am trying!,21
S08E15 The Birthing Video.txt,Joey,Hi.,26
S08E15 The Birthing Video.txt,Joey,"Oh, that’s, uh, that’s Phoebe’s friend’s dog. I don’t know what his real name is, but I call him Mozzarella.",27
S08E15 The Birthing Video.txt,Monica,What is it?,34
S08E15 The Birthing Video.txt,Chandler,"It’s yelling…bleeding…dilating. Oh, the dilating…",34
S08E15 The Birthing Video.txt,Monica,"Is this the video of the baby being born? Sweetie, this is Phoebe’s. Why were you even watching it?",34
S08E15 The Birthing Video.txt,Chandler,I thought…maybe…you got me porn for Valentine’s Day.,34
S08E15 The Birthing Video.txt,Chandler,"Well, I’m not really in a sexy mood right now.",35
S08E15 The Birthing Video.txt,Monica,"Honey, what’s going on?",35
S08E15 The Birthing Video.txt,Chandler,"Well, remember the first time we saw Jaws?",35
S08E15 The Birthing Video.txt,Monica,Mm-hmm.,35
S08E15 The Birthing Video.txt,Chandler,How long it took to go back in the water?,35
S08E15 The Birthing Video.txt,Monica,"Chandler, we can’t let this tape wreck Valentine’s Day!",35
S08E15 The Birthing Video.txt,Chandler,You don’t know. You didn’t see it.,35
S08E15 The Birthing Video.txt,Monica,"Child-birth, it’s a natural thing! It’s beautiful.",35
S08E15 The Birthing Video.txt,Monica,"Oh! Oh, my God! No wonder my mother hates me!",36
S08E15 The Birthing Video.txt,Monica,Don’t touch me!,37
S08E15 The Birthing Video.txt,Mona,Hi!,38
S08E15 The Birthing Video.txt,Mona,Good.,39
S08E15 The Birthing Video.txt,Ross,Yeah?,39
S08E15 The Birthing Video.txt,Mona,I brought you back a present.,39
S08E15 The Birthing Video.txt,Mona,I think it’s interesting.,40
S08E15 The Birthing Video.txt,Ross,I do too! I missed you!,40
S08E15 The Birthing Video.txt,Mona,"I missed you, too! So, how was your week?",40
S08E15 The Birthing Video.txt,Ross,"Oh, it was good! It was good. Actually, the baby started kicking!",40
S08E15 The Birthing Video.txt,Mona,How exciting!,40
S08E15 The Birthing Video.txt,Ross,Yeah! I know! It was. Oh… the only sad thing is I wasn’t around when it happened for the first time.,40
S08E15 The Birthing Video.txt,Mona,Oh no.,40
S08E15 The Birthing Video.txt,Ross,"Yeah, I’m missing out on all this other stuff, too. So, Joey suggested Rachel move in with me.",40
S08E15 The Birthing Video.txt,Ross,What?,41
S08E15 The Birthing Video.txt,Mona,"So, what’d you tell him?",45
S08E15 The Birthing Video.txt,Phoebe,How could you not tell Mona that Rachel is living with you?,47
S08E15 The Birthing Video.txt,Ross,"I don’t know, she seemed to think it was such a crazy idea! Um, plus, she, uh, she got me taffy!",47
S08E15 The Birthing Video.txt,Phoebe,"Taffy, really? I’ve never had any.",47
S08E15 The Birthing Video.txt,Ross,Ever?!,47
S08E15 The Birthing Video.txt,Ross,"Oh, no, no, no, I will! I just want to butter her up, first! You know, I’m going to take her to an amazing Valentine’s dinner. Do all this romantic stuff, and then, just when she thinks I’m the best boyfriend in the world, then I’m going to tell her that my pregnant ex-girlfriend is living with me.",48
S08E15 The Birthing Video.txt,Joey,"So, between her and me being friends, and her history with Ross, it just isn’t going to happen. It would be like you falling in love with a cat.",50
S08E15 The Birthing Video.txt,Joey,Hey.,51
S08E15 The Birthing Video.txt,Joey,No.,52
S08E15 The Birthing Video.txt,Phoebe,"Will you excuse us, we need to talk for a moment.",52
S08E15 The Birthing Video.txt,Phoebe,He’s miserable! What happened to him?,54
S08E15 The Birthing Video.txt,Joey,Nothing. We just talked about stuff.,54
S08E15 The Birthing Video.txt,Phoebe,What stuff?,54
S08E15 The Birthing Video.txt,Joey,Rachel stuff.,54
S08E15 The Birthing Video.txt,Phoebe,"Oh…Joey, you bummed him out! This was the happiest dog in the world, and he spends half a day with you, and look at him!",54
S08E15 The Birthing Video.txt,Joey,He’s breathing!,54
S08E15 The Birthing Video.txt,Phoebe,"Okay, I’m going to take him back to Wendy’s.",54
S08E15 The Birthing Video.txt,Ross,"Well, I’m, uh, going to pick up Mona. What have you got going tonight?",56
S08E15 The Birthing Video.txt,Rachel,"Oh, I’ve got big Valentine’s plans! I’ve got my Chinese food on the way, and the rest of your saltwater taffy!",56
S08E15 The Birthing Video.txt,Ross,"Y’know, it’s interesting! Most people think that’s made with seawater, when in fact—",56
S08E15 The Birthing Video.txt,Rachel,"Ross, we actually watched the documentary together.",56
S08E15 The Birthing Video.txt,Mona,"Change of plans, I made you a special Valentine’s dinner! Surprise!",59
S08E15 The Birthing Video.txt,Ross,I have no idea!,62
S08E15 The Birthing Video.txt,Mona,"Seriously, what is she doing?",63
S08E15 The Birthing Video.txt,Ross,"Uh…lately, she just likes hanging out here.",63
S08E15 The Birthing Video.txt,Mona,Why?,63
S08E15 The Birthing Video.txt,Ross,I think she’s lonely.,63
S08E15 The Birthing Video.txt,Mona,"Okay, but it’s Valentine’s Day!",63
S08E15 The Birthing Video.txt,Ross,I know.,63
S08E15 The Birthing Video.txt,Mona,Can’t we just ask her to go?,63
S08E15 The Birthing Video.txt,Ross,"No, no. She’s way to emotional. And by emotional I mean crazy.",63
S08E15 The Birthing Video.txt,Rachel,I’m not here! That’s just my Chinese food!,64
S08E15 The Birthing Video.txt,Mona,"Oh, my God! She has food delivered here?",64
S08E15 The Birthing Video.txt,Ross,"Mm-hmm. She’s—she’s emotional, but, but ballsy.",64
S08E15 The Birthing Video.txt,Ross,"And you thought she was going to be in our way! So, why don’t you, uh, open the champagne, and I’ll be right back. I’ve got a surprise for you.",65
S08E15 The Birthing Video.txt,Mona,You got another ex-wife back there?,65
S08E15 The Birthing Video.txt,Mona,"Oh, Rachel! Wait! Hey, I hope you don’t take this the wrong way, but, but, um… what are you doing?",67
S08E15 The Birthing Video.txt,Rachel,"Oh, I’m sorry! Do you need the phone?",67
S08E15 The Birthing Video.txt,Mona,"No, no. Listen, Ross is too nice to say anything, but this is his apartment, and, and, we gotta have some boundaries, so why don’t you go back to your place and give us some privacy?",67
S08E15 The Birthing Video.txt,Monica,How long has it been this time?,70
S08E15 The Birthing Video.txt,Chandler,90 seconds.,70
S08E15 The Birthing Video.txt,Monica,That’s better. 90 seconds is a long time not to think about it…except all I did was think about it.,70
S08E15 The Birthing Video.txt,Chandler,"You know, it haunts me? Up ‘til now, the worst thing I ever saw, was my father doing tequila shots off the naked houseboy. After this, I would gladly make that my screensaver!",70
S08E15 The Birthing Video.txt,Monica,"Okay, well, we have to get past this! Why don’t we get rid of the tape and pretend it never existed?",70
S08E15 The Birthing Video.txt,Chandler,I can do that.,70
S08E15 The Birthing Video.txt,Monica,Okay.,70
S08E15 The Birthing Video.txt,Chandler,Okay. Now all we’ve got to do is get rid of this chair.,71
S08E15 The Birthing Video.txt,Monica,"Oh, thank God!",72
S08E15 The Birthing Video.txt,Chandler,"Oh, I know!",72
S08E15 The Birthing Video.txt,Monica,Come in!,72
S08E15 The Birthing Video.txt,Monica,"Oh, my God.",73
S08E15 The Birthing Video.txt,Chandler,Poor Ross.,73
S08E15 The Birthing Video.txt,Chandler,"Oh, great. We have to watch him do yoga in his underwear, but for this he closes the drapes!",74
S08E15 The Birthing Video.txt,Monica,"Rach, you know that birthing tape you wanted to see? It’s here.",74
S08E15 The Birthing Video.txt,Chandler,"Oh, and we should warn you, before you watch it: don’t watch it.",74
S08E15 The Birthing Video.txt,Rachel,Why? You saw it? Is it scary?,74
S08E15 The Birthing Video.txt,Chandler,"Well, let’s just say it’s ironic how footage of someone being born can make you want to kill yourself.",74
S08E15 The Birthing Video.txt,Rachel,"Well, now, wait. Now I’m all freaked out. Come on, you guys will watch it with me.",74
S08E15 The Birthing Video.txt,Monica,"No, but I will leave a sweater that smells like me right next to you!",74
S08E15 The Birthing Video.txt,Rachel,"C’mon, seriously, you guys, you’re not going to make me watch this alone!",74
S08E15 The Birthing Video.txt,Monica,"She’s right…of course not. Honey, get the tape.",74
S08E15 The Birthing Video.txt,Chandler,Why have I seen this thing three times?!,76
S08E15 The Birthing Video.txt,Monica,It’s…still beautiful.,76
S08E15 The Birthing Video.txt,Rachel,Uh! It’s horrible!,76
S08E15 The Birthing Video.txt,Monica,"I know! I know, I’m so sorry for you!",76
S08E15 The Birthing Video.txt,Rachel,"Oh, my God!",76
S08E15 The Birthing Video.txt,Chandler,"Wait, you guys, look!",77
S08E15 The Birthing Video.txt,Rachel,What? Did her ass explode?!,77
S08E15 The Birthing Video.txt,Chandler,"No, the baby’s out! Look, look!",77
S08E15 The Birthing Video.txt,Monica,"Oh, look at those little fingers and toes!",77
S08E15 The Birthing Video.txt,Chandler,And look how happy the mom is now!,77
S08E15 The Birthing Video.txt,Monica,Oh…Rach!,77
S08E15 The Birthing Video.txt,Rachel,"Oh, screw you guys, you don’t have to do it!",77
S08E15 The Birthing Video.txt,Ross,"Hey, hey, man!",78
S08E15 The Birthing Video.txt,Joey,"Hey, what’s up?",78
S08E15 The Birthing Video.txt,Ross,Uh…Mona just dumped me.,78
S08E15 The Birthing Video.txt,Joey,"Oh, man, I’m sorry. Why?",78
S08E15 The Birthing Video.txt,Ross,"Well, with everything that’s been going on lately, I haven’t exactly been the perfect boyfriend. You know, I, uh, I didn’t tell her I got Rachel pregnant. I gave her a key to my apartment, and then had the locks changed! And then I lied to her about Rachel moving in with me. In a way, I actually judge her for not breaking up with me sooner, you know?",78

S08E15 The Birthing Video.txt,Joey,"Oh, I…I d—",78
S08E15 The Birthing Video.txt,Ross,"Hey, whatever it is, I am sure it has happened to me. Y’know, actually once—once I got dumped during sex.",78
S08E15 The Birthing Video.txt,Ross,"Anyway, so, uh, so what is it?",79
S08E15 The Birthing Video.txt,Joey,Forget about it. It’s no big deal.,79
S08E15 The Birthing Video.txt,Ross,C’mon! Joey! What is it?,79
S08E15 The Birthing Video.txt,Joey,It’s nothing.,79
S08E15 The Birthing Video.txt,Ross,"Hey, hey, it’s me. Why can’t you tell me?",79
S08E15 The Birthing Video.txt,Ross,She’s not a Tribbiani?,80

S08E15 The Birthing Video.txt,Joey,Yes.,80
S08E15 The Birthing Video.txt,Ross,"Well, uh, does she like you?",80
S08E15 The Birthing Video.txt,Joey,"Sometimes I think maybe she could. But it doesn’t matter, because I can’t do anything about it.",80
S08E15 The Birthing Video.txt,Ross,Why not?,80
S08E15 The Birthing Video.txt,Joey,"Well, it’s complicated. She’s with this other guy. For a long time. Someone from work, too. And I could never do that to the guy, because we’re really good friends.",80
S08E15 The Birthing Video.txt,Ross,"So, uh, this guy, she used to go out with, is, uh… is he still in love with her?",80
S08E15 The Birthing Video.txt,Joey,No. I don’t think so.,80
S08E15 The Birthing Video.txt,Ross,Okay. Um… is he a good guy?,80
S08E15 The Birthing Video.txt,Joey,"Yeah, he’s the best.",80
S08E15 The Birthing Video.txt,Ross,Then talk to him! He might be fine with it.,80
S08E15 The Birthing Video.txt,Joey,"Oh, I don’t know.",80
S08E15 The Birthing Video.txt,Ross,"Joey, it’s worth finding out. I mean, if you really like her.",80
S08E15 The Birthing Video.txt,Joey,"I do! So much! I can’t stop thinking about her! I can’t sleep, I—",80
S08E15 The Birthing Video.txt,Ross,"Okay, Joey, you know what? You have to go for it. How often does this happen to you, huh? You owe it to yourself.",80
S08E15 The Birthing Video.txt,Ross,"I’m going to…uh…I’m going to, um, put the bourbon in it at home.",81

S10E15 Estelle Dies.txt,Chandler,Or facing a bitch of a commute.,4
S10E15 Estelle Dies.txt,Rachel,"I know, it's huge, and it's scary, and it's... really far, far away from you guys, but this is such an incredible opportunity for me. And I've already talked to them about our situation with Emma, and they said they'll do whatever we need to make us feel comfortable.",4
S10E15 Estelle Dies.txt,Ross,Okay.,4

S10E15 Estelle Dies.txt,Chandler,I see.,11
S10E15 Estelle Dies.txt,Ross,"Well, Rachel moving to another country? Not being able to see her every day. How can I be okay with this?",11
S10E15 Estelle Dies.txt,Monica,"I know, but what are we gonna do? She really needs this job.",11
S10E15 Estelle Dies.txt,Ross,"Do you think if the Ralph Lauren people offered her her old job back, she would take it?",11
S10E15 Estelle Dies.txt,Monica,How is that gonna happen?,11
S10E15 Estelle Dies.txt,Chandler,Is this the best way to use one of your three magic wishes?,11
S10E15 Estelle Dies.txt,Ross,I don't know. I could talk to her boss. Yeah! I met him at that Christmas party. We really hit it off.,11
S10E15 Estelle Dies.txt,Monica,You mean the guy who kept calling you Ron?,11
S10E15 Estelle Dies.txt,Ross,I didn't say we were brothers.,11
S10E15 Estelle Dies.txt,Monica,"Hey Phoebe. Hey, tell me what you think. All right. The house next door to the one that we're buying in Westchester? Just went on the market. I wanna take a look at it, but Chandler doesn't.",12
S10E15 Estelle Dies.txt,Chandler,"We close escrow tomorrow, so seeing another house can only confuse us, and we're easily confused. We're not very bright.",12
S10E15 Estelle Dies.txt,Monica,But what if it is better than ours? Should we at least look?,12
S10E15 Estelle Dies.txt,Chandler,What do you think Pheebs?,12
S10E15 Estelle Dies.txt,Phoebe,"Well, I think that shirt makes you look like you should work at a Baskin Robbins... Anyway... Hey, isn't Joey's agent Estelle Leonard?",12
S10E15 Estelle Dies.txt,Chandler,Yeah.,12
S10E15 Estelle Dies.txt,Phoebe,She died.,12
S10E15 Estelle Dies.txt,Chandler,You're kidding!,12
S10E15 Estelle Dies.txt,Monica,That's terrible!,12
S10E15 Estelle Dies.txt,Chandler,Oh yeah?,13
S10E15 Estelle Dies.txt,Phoebe,"Yeah, she was just an agent.",13
S10E15 Estelle Dies.txt,Monica,Joey's gonna be *so* upset.,13
S10E15 Estelle Dies.txt,Chandler,I know. *He* always wanted to be the first black man to cross the Atlantic.,13
S10E15 Estelle Dies.txt,Phoebe,"Well, we cannot tell Joey about this. He's already flipping out about everything that's changing. This will push him over the edge.",13
S10E15 Estelle Dies.txt,Monica,"Seriously, you don't think we should tell him?",13
S10E15 Estelle Dies.txt,Phoebe,"Well, not for a little while. Let's just give him a few days to get used to everything else.",13
S10E15 Estelle Dies.txt,Monica,What if he reads it in the paper?,13
S10E15 Estelle Dies.txt,Chandler,"Unless Snoopy says it to Charlie Brown, I think we're okay.",13
S10E15 Estelle Dies.txt,Ross,"Yeah, I'm a friend of Rachel Green's. Uhm, actually we met at the Christmas party about two years ago.",14
S10E15 Estelle Dies.txt,Ross,"Uhm, well... I'm here to see if you'll give Rachel her job back.",15
S10E15 Estelle Dies.txt,Ross,"Oh, no. At first I have to get you to agree. Then we'll see if she wants to come back.",15
S10E15 Estelle Dies.txt,Ross,"Look, she loved her job here. And let's face it: you're not gonna find anyone who did it as well as she did it. Isn't that true?",15
S10E15 Estelle Dies.txt,Ross,"Oh, nothing, it’s just, it’s close to Ron. Does he.. Does little Ross like dinosaurs by any chance?",18
S10E15 Estelle Dies.txt,Ross,"You let Rachel come back, and it’s done.",19
S10E15 Estelle Dies.txt,Ross,"Yeah! Yes! Thank you! This is great. Thank you so much. And I swear, your kid is going to have the time of his life.",19

S10E15 Estelle Dies.txt,Phoebe,Hey. Everything ok?,20
S10E15 Estelle Dies.txt,Joey,I’m just mad at my agent.,20
S10E15 Estelle Dies.txt,Phoebe,Estelle? Why?,20
S10E15 Estelle Dies.txt,Joey,There’s a part in a TV movie that I would be perfect for and I didn’t even be put up for it! She’d better have a good reason.,20
S10E15 Estelle Dies.txt,Phoebe,I’m guessing she does.,20
S10E15 Estelle Dies.txt,Phoebe,"Well, no, no, wait, wait, wait. All right, I gotta go. Just listen. Promise me, that you will wait a minute before you call her.",21
S10E15 Estelle Dies.txt,Joey,Ok. Why?,21

S10E15 Estelle Dies.txt,Joey,"Yeah, actually I am!",25
S10E15 Estelle Dies.txt,Joey,"That’s it? You know, it seems all you do lately is drop the ball.",25
S10E15 Estelle Dies.txt,Joey,"No, no, look. All I’m saying is that you’re my agent, ok? And you’re not getting me into any auditions and I’m tired of it.",25
S10E15 Estelle Dies.txt,Phoebe,"Man, tough week for Estelle!",26
S10E15 Estelle Dies.txt,Ross,Hi.,27
S10E15 Estelle Dies.txt,Rachel,Hi.,27
S10E15 Estelle Dies.txt,Ross,Emma left her stuffed t-rex at my house. You know she can’t sleep without it.,27
S10E15 Estelle Dies.txt,Rachel,"Oh, well, she’s asleep now. Stop forcing that thing on her.",27
S10E15 Estelle Dies.txt,Ross,Ok.,27
S10E15 Estelle Dies.txt,Rachel,"Oh, you’re not gonna believe what happened to me today! Ralph Lauren called, and gave me my job back!",27
S10E15 Estelle Dies.txt,Ross,Nooo!,27
S10E15 Estelle Dies.txt,Rachel,"Yee. I mean, it was so weirdest thing. They fired me and then out of nowhere they just hire me back! I mean, that place must have been falling apart without me.",27
S10E15 Estelle Dies.txt,Ross,"So, you’re not going to Paris.",27
S10E15 Estelle Dies.txt,Rachel,"No, I’m still going.",27
S10E15 Estelle Dies.txt,Ross,Wh… wh…what?,27
S10E15 Estelle Dies.txt,Rachel,"When the Louis Vuitton people found out that Ralph Lauren wanted me back, the offered me more money! Isn’t that great?",27
S10E15 Estelle Dies.txt,Monica,"Hi. We’re buying the house next door, and we were wondering if we could just take a look around.",29
S10E15 Estelle Dies.txt,Lady,"Oh, sure. I’m showing it to someone else right now, but please, look around.",29
S10E15 Estelle Dies.txt,Monica,Thanks.,29
S10E15 Estelle Dies.txt,Chandler,"It feels like we’re cheating on our house. And if we’re gonna cheat, shouldn’t it be with like a hot, younger house, that does stuff that our house won’t do?",29
S10E15 Estelle Dies.txt,Monica,"Ours is so much better! This living room is smaller, the dining room looks like a cave! What a hole!",29
S10E15 Estelle Dies.txt,Lady,So? What do you think?,29
S10E15 Estelle Dies.txt,Monica,Love it!,29
S10E15 Estelle Dies.txt,Lady,"Well, we already have one offer on it, and I think the lady upstairs is goning to make another one.",29
S10E15 Estelle Dies.txt,Monica,"They could be our neighbors, what are they like?",29
S10E15 Estelle Dies.txt,Lady,"Oh, the woman upstairs is very nice. She and her husband have two kids, he's on Wall Street and she…",29
S10E15 Estelle Dies.txt,Janice,Oh my God!,29
S10E15 Estelle Dies.txt,Phoebe,"Hey Joey, want come with me to… are you ok?",32
S10E15 Estelle Dies.txt,Joey,"Yeah, I just… I just feel bad about firing Estelle. This is got to be killing her.",32
S10E15 Estelle Dies.txt,Phoebe,"No, that wouldn’t kill her. Ordinary embolism might.",32
S10E15 Estelle Dies.txt,Joey,"I don’t know. She’s got to be taking it hard, I was like her only client. Except for this guy who eats paper. And I’m guessing he eats more money than he makes. Look, I know she’s not a great agent, but she did stick with me for ten years. I’m gonna call her and hire her again.",32
S10E15 Estelle Dies.txt,Joey,Why?,33
S10E15 Estelle Dies.txt,Janice,What a small world!,38
S10E15 Estelle Dies.txt,Chandler,And yet I never run into Beyonce!,38
S10E15 Estelle Dies.txt,Realtor,You two know each other?,38
S10E15 Estelle Dies.txt,Chandler,This can not be happening!,44
S10E15 Estelle Dies.txt,Monica,"Okay, the realtor said another couple made an offer. Maybe the Janice's won't get it! Maybe the other couple will.",44
S10E15 Estelle Dies.txt,Chandler,"The only way that that is going to happen, is if the other couple are the Hitlers.",44
S10E15 Estelle Dies.txt,Chandler,"That is a great idea! And by the way, I don't mean to sound distasteful, but when did you start crapping money!?",45
S10E15 Estelle Dies.txt,Monica,"Okay, you come up with an idea.",45
S10E15 Estelle Dies.txt,Chandler,"Alright alright, we still have three hours till escrow closes on our house. We can still get out.",45
S10E15 Estelle Dies.txt,Monica,But we love our house.,45
S10E15 Estelle Dies.txt,Ross,Huh? So? We have a deal?,54

S10E15 Estelle Dies.txt,Phoebe,"Anyway, you did what you had to do. I'm okay.",63
S10E15 Estelle Dies.txt,Joey,"Can I ask you something? Uhm, what's it like there?",63
S10E15 Estelle Dies.txt,Janice,"Well... I just talked to Sid, we are definitely putting in an offer on the house... a-a-and I'll bet we get it.",66
S10E15 Estelle Dies.txt,Chandler,The Hitlers will be so disappointed.,66
S10E15 Estelle Dies.txt,Chandler,Wait! I just want you to know that... I'm so happy you're going to be here.,67
S10E15 Estelle Dies.txt,Chandler,Because... that way... we can pick up where we left off.,68

S10E15 Estelle Dies.txt,Janice,"Chandler, what are you talking about?",68
S10E15 Estelle Dies.txt,Chandler,"Now that you live next door, we can be together every day. Sid and Monica never have to know a thing.",68
S10E15 Estelle Dies.txt,Janice,"I don't know what to say... I mean, you know, obviously we have this... heat between us.",68
S10E15 Estelle Dies.txt,Janice,"But I love my husband. And I know you love your wife. Now, I don't think we should get this house now.",69
S10E15 Estelle Dies.txt,Chandler,Don't say that. Don't tangle the dream and take it away.,69
S10E15 Estelle Dies.txt,Janice,"Chandler, one of us has got to be strong.",69
S10E15 Estelle Dies.txt,Chandler,I understand.,69
S10E15 Estelle Dies.txt,Rachel,Hi!,72
S10E15 Estelle Dies.txt,Ross,Hey!,72
S10E15 Estelle Dies.txt,Rachel,You are never going to believe what happened to me today.,72
S10E15 Estelle Dies.txt,Ross,What?,72
S10E15 Estelle Dies.txt,Rachel,Ralph Lauren called again and they offered me more money.,72
S10E15 Estelle Dies.txt,Ross,They did?,72
S10E15 Estelle Dies.txt,Rachel,Yeah. It was the weirdest thing. Zelner called me and he said we'll do everything we can to get you back. And that I should thank some Ron... I don't even know what department that guy's in.,72
S10E15 Estelle Dies.txt,Ross,"So, what are you gonna do?",72
S10E15 Estelle Dies.txt,Rachel,"Well, I took it.",72

S10E15 Estelle Dies.txt,Rachel,What?,76
S10E15 Estelle Dies.txt,Ross,It's what you want. You should go.,76
S10E15 Estelle Dies.txt,Rachel,You really think so?,76
S10E15 Estelle Dies.txt,Ross,I really do.,76
S10E15 Estelle Dies.txt,Rachel,But I already told Zelner that I would come back...,76
S10E15 Estelle Dies.txt,Rachel,All right. ALL RIGHT! I'm gonna do it. I'm gonna go to Paris.,77

S01E10 The Monkey.txt,Rachel,"Oh, he is precious! Where did you get him?",3
S01E10 The Monkey.txt,Ross,My friend Bethel rescued him from some lab.,3
S01E10 The Monkey.txt,Phoebe,That is so cruel! Why? Why would a parent name their child Bethel?,3
S01E10 The Monkey.txt,Chandler,"Hey, that monkey's got a Ross on its ass!",3
S01E10 The Monkey.txt,Monica,"Ross, is he gonna live with you, like, in your apartment?",3

S01E10 The Monkey.txt,All,"Hey, Joey. Hey, buddy.",6
S01E10 The Monkey.txt,Monica,"So, how'd it go?",6
S01E10 The Monkey.txt,Joey,"Ahhhhhh, I didn't get the job.",6
S01E10 The Monkey.txt,Ross,How could you not get it? You were Santa last year.,6
S01E10 The Monkey.txt,Joey,"I dunno. Some fat guy's sleeping with the store manager. He's not even jolly, it's all political.",6
S01E10 The Monkey.txt,Monica,So what are you gonna be?,6
S01E10 The Monkey.txt,Joey,"Ah, I'm gonna be one of his helpers. It's just such a slap in the face, y'know?",6
S01E10 The Monkey.txt,Chandler,"Nothing for you, you have Paolo. You don't have to face the horrible pressures of this holiday: desperate scramble to find anything with lips just so you can have someone to kiss when the ball drops!! Man, I'm talking loud!",7
S01E10 The Monkey.txt,Rachel,"Well, for your information, Paolo is gonna be in Rome this New Year, so I'll be just as pathetic as the rest of you.",7
S01E10 The Monkey.txt,Phoebe,"Yeah, you wish!",7
S01E10 The Monkey.txt,Chandler,"It's just that I'm sick of being a victim of this Dick Clark holiday. I say this year, no dates, we make a pact. Just the six of us- dinner.",7
S01E10 The Monkey.txt,All,"Yeah, okay. Alright.",7
S01E10 The Monkey.txt,Chandler,"Y'know, I was hoping for a little more enthusiasm.",7
S01E10 The Monkey.txt,All,Woooo! Yeah!,7

S01E10 The Monkey.txt,Phoebe,"Oh, oh, good.",7
S01E10 The Monkey.txt,Max,"No. No, that's- that's okay.",16
S01E10 The Monkey.txt,Phoebe,"Well, c'mon, if it's important enough to discuss while I'm playing, then I assume it's important enough for everyone else to hear!",16
S01E10 The Monkey.txt,David,Noth- I was- I was just saying to my-,17
S01E10 The Monkey.txt,Phoebe,Could you speak up please?,17
S01E10 The Monkey.txt,Max,Daryl Hannah.,18
S01E10 The Monkey.txt,David,"Daryl Hannah was the most beautiful woman that he'd ever seen in his life and I said yeah, I liked her in Splash, a lot, but not so much in- in Wall Street, I thought she had kind of a",18
S01E10 The Monkey.txt,Max,Hard quality.,18
S01E10 The Monkey.txt,Joey,"Hey, that guy's going home with more than a note!",20
S01E10 The Monkey.txt,Rachel,"Pheebs, I can't believe he hasn't kissed you yet. I mean God, by my sixth date with Paolo, I mean he had already named both my breasts! ...Ooh. Did I just share too much?",22
S01E10 The Monkey.txt,Ross,Just a smidge.,22
S01E10 The Monkey.txt,Phoebe,"David's like, y'know, Scientist Guy. He's very methodical.",22
S01E10 The Monkey.txt,Monica,I think it's romantic.,22
S01E10 The Monkey.txt,Phoebe,Me too! Oh! Did you ever see An Officer and a Gentleman?,22
S01E10 The Monkey.txt,Rachel,Yeah!,22
S01E10 The Monkey.txt,Phoebe,"Well, he's kinda like the guy I went to see that with. Except, except he-he's smarter, and gentler, and sweeter... I just- I just wanna be with him all the time. Day and night, and night and day... and special occasions...",22
S01E10 The Monkey.txt,Chandler,"Wait a minute, wait a minute, I see where this is going, you're gonna ask him to New Year's, aren't you. You're gonna break the pact. She's gonna break the pact.",22
S01E10 The Monkey.txt,Phoebe,"No, no, no, no, no, no. Yeah, could I just?",22
S01E10 The Monkey.txt,Chandler,"Yeah, 'cause I already asked Janice.",22
S01E10 The Monkey.txt,Monica,What?!,22
S01E10 The Monkey.txt,Ross,"C'mon, this was a pact! This was your pact!",22
S01E10 The Monkey.txt,Chandler,"I snapped, okay? I couldn't handle the pressure and I snapped.",22
S01E10 The Monkey.txt,Monica,"Yeah, but Janice? That-that was like the worst breakup in history!",22
S01E10 The Monkey.txt,Chandler,"I'm not saying it was a good idea, I'm saying I snapped!",22
S01E10 The Monkey.txt,Joey,"Hi. Hi, sorry I'm late.",23

S01E10 The Monkey.txt,Ross,"Okay, look, he's not gonna hurt them, right?",26
S01E10 The Monkey.txt,Monica,Do you always have to bring him here?,26
S01E10 The Monkey.txt,Ross,"I didn't wanna leave him alone. Alright? We- we had our first fight this morning. I think it has to do with my working late. I said some things that I didn't mean, and he- he threw some faeces...",26
S01E10 The Monkey.txt,Chandler,"Y'know, if you're gonna work late, I could look in on him for you.",26
S01E10 The Monkey.txt,Ross,"Oh, that'd be great! Okay, but if you do, make sure it seems like you're there to see him, okay, and you're not like doing it as a favour to me.",26
S01E10 The Monkey.txt,Chandler,"Okay, but if he asks, I'm not going to lie.",26
S01E10 The Monkey.txt,David,"...But, you can't actually test this theory, because today's particle accelerators are nowhere near powerful enough to simulate these conditions.",27

S01E10 The Monkey.txt,Phoebe,Sure.,28
S01E10 The Monkey.txt,David,"Right. But, see, the longer I waited, the more phenomenal the kiss had to be, and now we've reached a place where it's just gotta be one of those things where I just like... sweep everything off the table and throw you down on it. And, uh, I'm not really a, uh, sweeping sorta fella.",28
S01E10 The Monkey.txt,Phoebe,"Oh, David, I, I think you are a sweeping sorta fella. I mean, you're a sweeper! ...trapped inside a physicist's body.",28

S01E10 The Monkey.txt,Ross,"Hey, y'know, this is so not what I needed right now.",36
S01E10 The Monkey.txt,Monica,What's the matter?,36
S01E10 The Monkey.txt,Ross,"Oh, it's-it's Marcel. He keeps shutting me out, y'know? He's walking around all the time dragging his hands...",36

S01E10 The Monkey.txt,David,Hey!,38

S01E10 The Monkey.txt,Max,It'd be even more exciting if we were going.,40
S01E10 The Monkey.txt,David,"Thank you, Max. Thank you.",42
S01E10 The Monkey.txt,Phoebe,So-so you're really not going?,42
S01E10 The Monkey.txt,David,I don't know. I don't know what I'm gonna do. I just- you decide.,42
S01E10 The Monkey.txt,Phoebe,Oh don't do that.,42

S01E10 The Monkey.txt,Monica,That thing is not coming in here.,50
S01E10 The Monkey.txt,Ross,"'That thing'? This is how you greet guests at a party? Let me ask you something, if I showed up here with my new girlfriend, she wouldn't be welcome in your home?",50
S01E10 The Monkey.txt,Monica,I'm guessing your new girlfriend wouldn't urinate on my coffee table.,50
S01E10 The Monkey.txt,Ross,Okay. He was more embarrassed about that than anyone. Okay? And for him to have the courage to walk back in here like nothing happened...,50
S01E10 The Monkey.txt,Monica,Alright. Just keep him away from me.,50
S01E10 The Monkey.txt,Monica,"Oh my gosh! Rachel, honey.. are you okay? Where-where's Paolo?",52
S01E10 The Monkey.txt,Rachel,Rome. Jerk missed his flight.,52
S01E10 The Monkey.txt,Phoebe,And then... your face is bloated?,52
S01E10 The Monkey.txt,Sandy,"Y'know, when I saw you at the store last week, it was probably the first time I ever mentally undressed an elf.",54

S01E10 The Monkey.txt,Phoebe,"Hi, Max!",69
S01E10 The Monkey.txt,David,Wow.,70

S01E10 The Monkey.txt,David,"Yeah, I'm fine, I'm fine.",71
S01E10 The Monkey.txt,Phoebe,You're going to Minsk.,72
S01E10 The Monkey.txt,David,"No, I'm... not going to Minsk.",72
S01E10 The Monkey.txt,Phoebe,"Oh, you are so going to Minsk. You belong in Minsk. You can't stay here just 'cause of me.",72
S01E10 The Monkey.txt,David,"Yes I can. Because if I go it means I have to break up with you, and I can't break up with you.",72
S01E10 The Monkey.txt,David,"Uh, ow.",73
S01E10 The Monkey.txt,David,I'll never forget you.,74

S01E10 The Monkey.txt,Rachel,"Vrrbddy, the bll is drrbing.",78
S01E10 The Monkey.txt,Rachel,The bll is drrbing!,79
S01E10 The Monkey.txt,Chandler,And the moment of joy is upon us.,80
S01E10 The Monkey.txt,Joey,Looks like that no date pact thing worked out.,80
S01E10 The Monkey.txt,Phoebe,Everybody looks so happy. I hate that.,80
S01E10 The Monkey.txt,Monica,Not everybody's happy. Hey Bobby!,80
S01E10 The Monkey.txt,Phoebe,I dunno. I don't feel like kissing anyone tonight.,82
S01E10 The Monkey.txt,Rachel,I can't kiss anyone.,82
S01E10 The Monkey.txt,Monica,So I'm kissing everyone?,82
S01E10 The Monkey.txt,Joey,"Nonono, you can't kiss Ross, that's your brother.",82
S01E10 The Monkey.txt,Ross,Perfect. Perfect. So now everybody's getting kissed but me.,82
S01E10 The Monkey.txt,Chandler,"Alright, somebody kiss me. Somebody kiss me, it's midnight! Somebody kiss me!",82

S04E08 Chandler In A Box.txt,Phoebe,"Look everyone, it’s the spirit of Thanksgiving!",15
S04E08 Chandler In A Box.txt,Rachel,So are things with you and Joey any better?,15
S04E08 Chandler In A Box.txt,Chandler,"They couldn’t be worse. I spent eight hours calling him last night, just trying to get him to talk to me.",15
S04E08 Chandler In A Box.txt,Rachel,"Oh wow, eight hours? So you could probably really use one of those plug-in telephone headsets huh?",15
S04E08 Chandler In A Box.txt,Ross,Should we all expect Christmas gifts that can be stolen from your office?,15
S04E08 Chandler In A Box.txt,Rachel,You shouldn’t.,15
S04E08 Chandler In A Box.txt,Phoebe,"Speaking of Christmas, umm since Monica and I are starting a new business and have like no money, umm, this year maybe we could do secret Santa, and then we each only buy one gift. And-and there’s the added mystery of who gets who.",15
S04E08 Chandler In A Box.txt,Rachel,"Well, I’m gonna take a nap, turkey makes me sleepy.",17
S04E08 Chandler In A Box.txt,Monica,We haven’t eaten yet!,17
S04E08 Chandler In A Box.txt,Chandler,"Hey, by any chance did either of pick uh Rachel for your secret Santa, ‘cause I wanna trade for her.",18
S04E08 Chandler In A Box.txt,Phoebe,I picked her! Oh thank God you want her! Ooh!,18
S04E08 Chandler In A Box.txt,Chandler,Wow! Why do you want to get rid of her so badly?,18
S04E08 Chandler In A Box.txt,Phoebe,"Because she exchanges every gift she ever gets, it’s like impossible to get her something she likes. Come on, let’s trade!",18
S04E08 Chandler In A Box.txt,Phoebe,Ohh.,19
S04E08 Chandler In A Box.txt,Monica,"Well, maybe you could give to somebody else. Ooh, like Ross Geller.",19
S04E08 Chandler In A Box.txt,Chandler,"Op, y'know what though, it’s kind’ve a girlie briefcase.",19
S04E08 Chandler In A Box.txt,Monica,Who cares? He works in a museum!,19
S04E08 Chandler In A Box.txt,Chandler,"Hey, what time is it? The big game is about to start!",19
S04E08 Chandler In A Box.txt,Phoebe,"You don’t have to do that, Ross and Joey aren’t here, you can watch the parade if you want.",19
S04E08 Chandler In A Box.txt,Chandler,Thanks.,19
S04E08 Chandler In A Box.txt,Phoebe,"God, what happened?!",20
S04E08 Chandler In A Box.txt,Monica,"Oh my God, ice just got in my eye!",20

S04E08 Chandler In A Box.txt,Phoebe,"Open it up, let me see.",21
S04E08 Chandler In A Box.txt,Monica,"Oh, y’know what, I can’t, it really kills.",21
S04E08 Chandler In A Box.txt,Chandler,Well maybe you should put some ice on it.,21
S04E08 Chandler In A Box.txt,Phoebe,"Ooh, God it looks bad.",21
S04E08 Chandler In A Box.txt,Rachel,"Honey, maybe we should take you to a doctor.",21
S04E08 Chandler In A Box.txt,Monica,"No, my eye doctor is Richard! I can’t go to him when I don’t have a boyfriend!",21
S04E08 Chandler In A Box.txt,Chandler,He’s really picky about his patients.,21
S04E08 Chandler In A Box.txt,Phoebe,"Honey, you’ve got to go. What’s his office number?",21
S04E08 Chandler In A Box.txt,Monica,Yes!!,23
S04E08 Chandler In A Box.txt,Phoebe,Yes! She’s very excited about that.,23
S04E08 Chandler In A Box.txt,Ross,"Hey-hey, I thought she told you to follow the recipe exactly!",25
S04E08 Chandler In A Box.txt,Phoebe,"Okay, get out of my kitchen!",25
S04E08 Chandler In A Box.txt,Phoebe,All right I… I gotta call my mom and ask her a left handed cooking question.,26
S04E08 Chandler In A Box.txt,Ross,"So listen ah, I picked Monica for secret Santa, but I’m already getting her something for Chanukah, I was wondering if you wanna switch.",26
S04E08 Chandler In A Box.txt,Chandler,"Oh y’know what, I was already trying to trade for ah, well, you.",26
S04E08 Chandler In A Box.txt,Ross,"Really?! Wow! That’s-that’s so nice, what are you gonna get me?",26
S04E08 Chandler In A Box.txt,Chandler,"I don’t know R.G., I was thinking something girlie for your office.",26
S04E08 Chandler In A Box.txt,Ross,"Yeah, well maybe Phoebe will switch with me.",26
S04E08 Chandler In A Box.txt,Chandler,"Oh no-no-no, you don’t want to do that, then you’re gonna get stuck with Rachel and she exchanges every gift she ever gets.",26
S04E08 Chandler In A Box.txt,Ross,"Oh, that’s not true! I’ve got her lots of stuff she never took back.",26
S04E08 Chandler In A Box.txt,Chandler,Like?,26
S04E08 Chandler In A Box.txt,Ross,"Like uh, that gold necklace I got her last year.",26
S04E08 Chandler In A Box.txt,Chandler,When was the last time you saw her wear it?,26
S04E08 Chandler In A Box.txt,Ross,"Well, she wore it all Christmas day, and then uh…",26
S04E08 Chandler In A Box.txt,Chandler,Big dog?,26
S04E08 Chandler In A Box.txt,Joey,Hey!,28
S04E08 Chandler In A Box.txt,Ross,What are you doing?,28
S04E08 Chandler In A Box.txt,Joey,I’m sending back all this stuff that Chandler bought out of guilt.,28
S04E08 Chandler In A Box.txt,Ross,Everything? Even the TV?,28
S04E08 Chandler In A Box.txt,Joey,No! I’m putting that in my room.,28
S04E08 Chandler In A Box.txt,Ross,"Listen, Joey, I know what he did was wrong but don’t you think you could at least hear the guy out?",28
S04E08 Chandler In A Box.txt,Joey,"Back when you and Rachel were together, if Chandler had kissed her, would you hear him out?",28
S04E08 Chandler In A Box.txt,Ross,"That’s a good point. So uh, how long are you gonna punish him?",28
S04E08 Chandler In A Box.txt,Joey,Five years.,28
S04E08 Chandler In A Box.txt,Ross,You’ve sentenced him?!,28
S04E08 Chandler In A Box.txt,Joey,Hey! Don’t do the crime if you can’t do the time.,28
S04E08 Chandler In A Box.txt,Ross,"Joey, the guy’s your best friend.",28
S04E08 Chandler In A Box.txt,Joey,"No, was my best friend. Anyway, I don’t know why you’re pushing for him so hard. With him out of the way as my best friend, there’s a spot open.",28
S04E08 Chandler In A Box.txt,Ross,"Oh, who? Me?",28
S04E08 Chandler In A Box.txt,Joey,Yeah!,28

S04E08 Chandler In A Box.txt,Ross,I’m gonna get you to talk to Chandler.,28
S04E08 Chandler In A Box.txt,Joey,All right. But if you weren’t my best friend.,28
S04E08 Chandler In A Box.txt,Kathy,"Oh my God, is it really that bad?",29
S04E08 Chandler In A Box.txt,Chandler,"I walk into a room and he won’t even talk to me, he just mumbles something in Italian. And I know he only knows the bad words.",29
S04E08 Chandler In A Box.txt,Gunther,"I thought you were Chandler. But umm, one of who is over there.",30
S04E08 Chandler In A Box.txt,Kathy,Oh.,31

S04E08 Chandler In A Box.txt,Chandler,What?!,38
S04E08 Chandler In A Box.txt,Joey,"Yeah, y’know at first I thought we could talk about this y’know, work it out, but uh, seeing you two together I don’t think I…",38
S04E08 Chandler In A Box.txt,Chandler,"Hey, look, what do you want me to say? Do you want me to say that I’ll stop seeing her?",38
S04E08 Chandler In A Box.txt,Chandler,"Hey, look, I know what it is to be a friend, I just-I just screwed up!",39
S04E08 Chandler In A Box.txt,Joey,Yeah! You did! And that’s why I’m leaving.,39
S04E08 Chandler In A Box.txt,Chandler,"All right look, if you’re not gonna stay for me, then at least stay for them! Okay, they have had a very difficult year! What with the robbery and all!",40
S04E08 Chandler In A Box.txt,Joey,"When that guy was robbing us, and I was locked in the entertainment unit for like six hours, you know what I was doing in there all that time? I was thinking about how I let you down!",40
S04E08 Chandler In A Box.txt,Chandler,What?,40
S04E08 Chandler In A Box.txt,Joey,"Yeah! But if would’ve know what kind of friend you were gonna turn out to be, I wouldn’t have worried about it so much! See you around!",40

S04E08 Chandler In A Box.txt,Monica,"Hey, come on, Phoebe, you understand don’t you?",49
S04E08 Chandler In A Box.txt,Phoebe,"Yeah, I can see where I’d be your best shot but, no. I’m sorry, but I think it’s twisted.",49

S08E11 Rosss Step Forward.txt,Phoebe,"Wait a second! This is about the fourth month of your pregnancy, right?",3

S08E11 Rosss Step Forward.txt,Phoebe,"Wait, I’m-I’m sorry. What’s the big deal about a holiday card?",13
S08E11 Rosss Step Forward.txt,Ross,"Married couples send out cards, families send out cards, people who have been dating for a couple of months do not send out cards! What-what is she crazy?!",13
S08E11 Rosss Step Forward.txt,Joey,"Hey-hey-hey, hey that’s your wife you’re talking about!",13

S08E11 Rosss Step Forward.txt,Monica,No leg-chewing for us sir.,14
S08E11 Rosss Step Forward.txt,Doug,"Oh well, give it time. So the divorce, the marriage, we’ve got a lot to celebrate. How about we all go out to dinner tomorrow night?",14
S08E11 Rosss Step Forward.txt,Doug,"Tomorrow night it is then, I should be out of court by six. They keep throwing these sexual harassment cases at me and I keep knocking them out of the park!",15
S08E11 Rosss Step Forward.txt,Chandler,No.,16
S08E11 Rosss Step Forward.txt,Monica,That’s because he wasn’t invited because of the way he behaved at our engagement party.,16
S08E11 Rosss Step Forward.txt,Chandler,"Oh yeah. Boy, urine cuts right through an ice sculpture doesn’t it?",16
S08E11 Rosss Step Forward.txt,Mona,Hi!,17

S08E11 Rosss Step Forward.txt,Mona,How many did you want? I’m getting a hundred.,17
S08E11 Rosss Step Forward.txt,Ross,"A hundred?! Well, I-I guess I’ll take a—Mona, uh…I-I’m not sure about the whole uh, card thing.",17
S08E11 Rosss Step Forward.txt,Mona,Really? Why not?,17
S08E11 Rosss Step Forward.txt,Ross,"Sending out a holiday card, together, I mean I just don’t know if we’re really quite there yet.",17
S08E11 Rosss Step Forward.txt,Mona,"Oh y’know, I didn’t think of it that way. You’re right. You’re right. So, can I ask you a question?",17
S08E11 Rosss Step Forward.txt,Ross,Yeah.,17
S08E11 Rosss Step Forward.txt,Mona,Where are we?,17
S08E11 Rosss Step Forward.txt,Ross,Huh.,17
S08E11 Rosss Step Forward.txt,Mona,"Y’know, like where are we? Where is this relationship going?",17
S08E11 Rosss Step Forward.txt,Ross,Hmm…,17
S08E11 Rosss Step Forward.txt,Mona,"I mean I love spending time with you, y’know I just—I hope we’re moving forward. I mean, we should probably talk about that. Don’t you think?",17
S08E11 Rosss Step Forward.txt,Ross,Let’s do the card!,18
S08E11 Rosss Step Forward.txt,Mona,What?,18
S08E11 Rosss Step Forward.txt,Ross,The card! I think we’re there!,18
S08E11 Rosss Step Forward.txt,Mona,Okay. I—But I think we should still have this conversation.,18
S08E11 Rosss Step Forward.txt,Ross,"Really?! I mean, even with the card?",18
S08E11 Rosss Step Forward.txt,Nurse,Hi!,19
S08E11 Rosss Step Forward.txt,Rachel,Hi!,19
S08E11 Rosss Step Forward.txt,Nurse,"Just so you know, Dr. Long can’t be here today, she was called to the hospital, so Dr. Schiff will be seeing you.",19
S08E11 Rosss Step Forward.txt,Rachel,"Yes, you are.",21
S08E11 Rosss Step Forward.txt,Rachel,"Oh, really, really good. But enough about me, come on! Where-where are you from? What do you do?",21
S08E11 Rosss Step Forward.txt,Rachel,"Right! Right! I-I actually meant in your spare time, do you cook? Do you ski? Or do you just hang out with your wife or girlfriend?",21
S08E11 Rosss Step Forward.txt,Rachel,"Oh, I love to ski! How amazing is this?!",21
S08E11 Rosss Step Forward.txt,Rachel,No. I’m very comfortable.,21
S08E11 Rosss Step Forward.txt,Rachel,"No! Shoot, Dr. Schiff what kind of question is that?!",21
S08E11 Rosss Step Forward.txt,Rachel,Well would you like me to lie down on the table?,21
S08E11 Rosss Step Forward.txt,Rachel,Do you feel it too?,21
S08E11 Rosss Step Forward.txt,Rachel,Hi.,22
S08E11 Rosss Step Forward.txt,Phoebe,"Oh hey! So, how did your doctor’s appointment go?",22
S08E11 Rosss Step Forward.txt,Rachel,"Well, let’s see. Uh, they gave me cute doctor today and in the middle of the exam I put my pinky in his chin dimple.",22
S08E11 Rosss Step Forward.txt,Phoebe,Oh my God.,22
S08E11 Rosss Step Forward.txt,Monica,Why did you do that?,22
S08E11 Rosss Step Forward.txt,Phoebe,"Okay, remember that little problem I was having during my fourth month of pregnancy?",22
S08E11 Rosss Step Forward.txt,Monica,"Oh yeah, the Evander Holyfield phase. Oh man you were so hard up you practically came on to me.",22
S08E11 Rosss Step Forward.txt,Phoebe,You wish.,22
S08E11 Rosss Step Forward.txt,Monica,"Hey, I could’ve had you if I wanted you.",22
S08E11 Rosss Step Forward.txt,Phoebe,Oh yeah? Come and get it.,22
S08E11 Rosss Step Forward.txt,Rachel,"Okay, even this is turning me on!",22
S08E11 Rosss Step Forward.txt,Rachel,"Oh hey! Hey Ross! Hey how’s it, how’s it going with you and Mona? Are you guys still together?",23
S08E11 Rosss Step Forward.txt,Ross,"Oh yeah, yeah we’re moving forward. You’ll be getting our card!",23
S08E11 Rosss Step Forward.txt,Monica,You and Mona are doing a holiday card together?,23
S08E11 Rosss Step Forward.txt,Ross,"Yeah, we’re not just doing a card! Y’know, she-she also wants to have the conversation about where the relationship is going.",23
S08E11 Rosss Step Forward.txt,Phoebe,Ugh! Women!,23
S08E11 Rosss Step Forward.txt,Ross,"I know! I know! Why do you guys need to have this conversation?! Huh? I mean no self-respecting man would ask a woman, ""So, where is this going?""",23
S08E11 Rosss Step Forward.txt,Rachel,Uh Ross? You asked me that.,23
S08E11 Rosss Step Forward.txt,Ross,"Hey! You were a closed book! Okay? I’m not a mind reader! Besides, I hate those conversations. I’m horrible at them. Really! Maybe-maybe I need kind of a gesture. Y’know, something that says we’re moving forward without having to talk about it.",23
S08E11 Rosss Step Forward.txt,Monica,Like asking her to move in with you?,23
S08E11 Rosss Step Forward.txt,Ross,Smaller than that.,23
S08E11 Rosss Step Forward.txt,Monica,Making her a mixed tape?,23
S08E11 Rosss Step Forward.txt,Ross,"Uh, bigger than that.",23
S08E11 Rosss Step Forward.txt,Phoebe,Give her a key to your apartment.,23
S08E11 Rosss Step Forward.txt,Ross,Whoa-hello! We were closer with the mixed tape.,23
S08E11 Rosss Step Forward.txt,Monica,"All right. Have you said, ""I love you?"" You could say, I love you.",23
S08E11 Rosss Step Forward.txt,Ross,"Yeah I-I don’t-I don’t think I’m quite there yet, but I could say I looove spending time with you.",23
S08E11 Rosss Step Forward.txt,Phoebe,"No, we hate that.",23
S08E11 Rosss Step Forward.txt,Monica,That is a slap in the face.,23
S08E11 Rosss Step Forward.txt,Ross,"Forget it. I-I—Y’know what? I’ll just have the conversation. I’ll just say I like things the way they are, and hope for the best. What do you think Rach?",23
S08E11 Rosss Step Forward.txt,Rachel,"I think, if it was a little colder in here I could see your nipples through that sweater.",23
S08E11 Rosss Step Forward.txt,Doug,"Bing! We’re all set for tonight, 8 o’clock.",24
S08E11 Rosss Step Forward.txt,Chandler,"Oh uh, as it turns out, we can’t do it. Monica has to work.",24
S08E11 Rosss Step Forward.txt,Doug,"Oh, my ex-wife didn’t work, unless you call turning into her mother work. Fine. Tomorrow night then.",24
S08E11 Rosss Step Forward.txt,Chandler,Oh uh well tomorrow’s no good for her either.,24
S08E11 Rosss Step Forward.txt,Doug,Oh? Why not?,24
S08E11 Rosss Step Forward.txt,Chandler,It’s the semi-finals…of her…botchy ball tournament.,24
S08E11 Rosss Step Forward.txt,Doug,"What’s going on Bing? Does uh, your wife have a problem with me or something?",24
S08E11 Rosss Step Forward.txt,Chandler,Well now-now you’re just talking crazy.,24
S08E11 Rosss Step Forward.txt,Doug,So why can’t the three of us go out together?,24
S08E11 Rosss Step Forward.txt,Chandler,Because uh…we-we…we split up. Monica and I split up. Hold me.,24
S08E11 Rosss Step Forward.txt,Doug,"Good God Bing I…well I can’t say I’m altogether surprised, I saw the way she looked at you, and there was no love there. And the way she looked at me, pure lust.",24
S08E11 Rosss Step Forward.txt,Chandler,Y’know what would really help me through this tough time is choking something. Can I choke ya?,24
S08E11 Rosss Step Forward.txt,Doug,"Bing my boy, we’re gonna get you over this. Now here’s the plan, grab your coat, we’re going to a strip club.",24
S08E11 Rosss Step Forward.txt,Ross,"Here we go. Mona umm, I think it’s time we-we had a conversation about-about where things are with us.",26
S08E11 Rosss Step Forward.txt,Mona,"Yeah, I-I think I suggested that.",26
S08E11 Rosss Step Forward.txt,Mona,Okay.,27
S08E11 Rosss Step Forward.txt,Mona,"I’m sorry, so umm, so where are we?",28
S08E11 Rosss Step Forward.txt,Ross,"Well, well to sum up, we’re having fun, you look young.",28

S08E11 Rosss Step Forward.txt,Mona,You don’t think this is too fast.,29
S08E11 Rosss Step Forward.txt,Rachel,You gave her a key to your apartment?!,31
S08E11 Rosss Step Forward.txt,Ross,"Not just a key, I gave her the only key! I am now a homeless person in a very serious relationship.",31
S08E11 Rosss Step Forward.txt,Ross,"Oh great, I live on the street.",32
S08E11 Rosss Step Forward.txt,Rachel,Hey!,33
S08E11 Rosss Step Forward.txt,Phoebe,"Hi! Okay, Monica, Rachel, this is my friend Roger.",33
S08E11 Rosss Step Forward.txt,Roger,Hey everybody.,33
S08E11 Rosss Step Forward.txt,Monica,Hi Roger.,33
S08E11 Rosss Step Forward.txt,Phoebe,"Umm, he’s here to have sex with you.",35
S08E11 Rosss Step Forward.txt,Rachel,What?,35
S08E11 Rosss Step Forward.txt,Phoebe,You’re welcome.,35
S08E11 Rosss Step Forward.txt,Rachel,Phoebe no!,35
S08E11 Rosss Step Forward.txt,Phoebe,"It’s okay, he’s a virgin.",35
S08E11 Rosss Step Forward.txt,Monica,"Rachel umm, I was just talking to this guy and I think he’ll have sex with you.",35
S08E11 Rosss Step Forward.txt,Phoebe,"Yeah, okay let’s leave these two alone.",35
S08E11 Rosss Step Forward.txt,Rachel,"No! I do not care what my hormones are doing, I am not going to just do it with some random guy!",35
S08E11 Rosss Step Forward.txt,Doug,"Oh Bing, look at those twin sisters dancing together. Let me buy you a lap dance with those girls. Huh?",37
S08E11 Rosss Step Forward.txt,Chandler,"Oh that’s all right sir, and that’s just one girl.",37
S08E11 Rosss Step Forward.txt,Chandler,It’s a hand. It’s a thing you use as a Jack and Coke holder.,38
S08E11 Rosss Step Forward.txt,Doug,"No, it’s a wedding ring. You gotta get rid of it. We’re gonna go to the East River right now and throw it in there!",38
S08E11 Rosss Step Forward.txt,Chandler,Oh no-no-no!,38
S08E11 Rosss Step Forward.txt,Doug,"Oh yeah-yeah-yeah, y’know I did it and I felt a hell of a lot better and if you whip it just right you might hit a seagull in the head.",38
S08E11 Rosss Step Forward.txt,Ross,"Okay, and oh I’m gonna need a bunch of extra keys. Apparently I give them away for no reason at all.",39
S08E11 Rosss Step Forward.txt,Ross,No. That guy is.,40
S08E11 Rosss Step Forward.txt,Mona,I don’t understand. You-you give me a key to your apartment and then you change the lock.,40
S08E11 Rosss Step Forward.txt,Mona,"Umm, I-I thought we were moving forward and now you’re-you’re sending me all these mixed signals. What are you trying to tell me?",41
S08E11 Rosss Step Forward.txt,Ross,I’m trying to tell you I made you a mix tape.,41
S08E11 Rosss Step Forward.txt,Mona,What?,41
S08E11 Rosss Step Forward.txt,Ross,I love you!,41
S08E11 Rosss Step Forward.txt,Chandler,Hi honey I’m home.,43
S08E11 Rosss Step Forward.txt,Monica,From the tequila factory?,43
S08E11 Rosss Step Forward.txt,Chandler,"It was awful. To get out of going to dinner with Doug I told him that you and I split up. So then he took me to all these strip clubs and sleazy bars, and then when I wouldn’t give him my wedding ring, he threw a soda can at a bird!",43
S08E11 Rosss Step Forward.txt,Monica,Come here. I can breath through my mouth.,43
S08E11 Rosss Step Forward.txt,Chandler,"Y’know what the worse part was? I got to see what my life would be like without you. It was like It’s a Wonderful Life with lap dances. Please promise that you will never leave me, that we will grow old together, and be with each other for the rest of our lives.",43
S08E11 Rosss Step Forward.txt,Monica,"I promise. Hey, speaking of together, how about we send out a holiday card this year?",43
S08E11 Rosss Step Forward.txt,Chandler,"Ooh, I don’t know if we’re there yet.",43
S08E11 Rosss Step Forward.txt,Joey,Who was that?,45
S08E11 Rosss Step Forward.txt,Rachel,It’s just the pizza place.,45
S08E11 Rosss Step Forward.txt,Joey,You hung up on the pizza place? I don’t hang up on your friends.,45
S08E11 Rosss Step Forward.txt,Rachel,"I’m sorry honey, I’m just having a, having a rough day.",45
S08E11 Rosss Step Forward.txt,Joey,"Oh, what’s wrong?",45
S08E11 Rosss Step Forward.txt,Rachel,"Oh you really, you really just don’t want to hear about it.",45
S08E11 Rosss Step Forward.txt,Joey,Then why did I ask?,45
S08E11 Rosss Step Forward.txt,Rachel,"Okay, it’s just—and this is really embarrassing—but lately with this whole pregnancy thing I’m just finding myself…how do I put this umm, erotically charged.",45
S08E11 Rosss Step Forward.txt,Joey,Is that college talk for horny?,45
S08E11 Rosss Step Forward.txt,Joey,"Good, I uh, I saw a pretty big pigeon.",46

S08E11 Rosss Step Forward.txt,Joey,I know!,50
S08E11 Rosss Step Forward.txt,Joey,Do you wanna do it?,51
S08E11 Rosss Step Forward.txt,Rachel,No!,51
S08E11 Rosss Step Forward.txt,Joey,"All right, me neither! I was just testing you!",51

S08E13 Chandler Takes A Bath.txt,Monica,I just had the most amazing bath.,7
S08E13 Chandler Takes A Bath.txt,Chandler,Really? I don’t like baths.,7
S08E13 Chandler Takes A Bath.txt,Monica,"Wait, you like them with me.",7
S08E13 Chandler Takes A Bath.txt,Chandler,"Honey, it’s not the bath I enjoy, it’s the wet, naked lady.",7
S08E13 Chandler Takes A Bath.txt,Monica,"Oh, baths are so relaxing!",7
S08E13 Chandler Takes A Bath.txt,Chandler,Really? What do you do? You just sit in there stewing in your own filth.,7
S08E13 Chandler Takes A Bath.txt,Monica,"How dirty do you think I am? I’m telling you, if you had some candles and some bubbles and some music, you would love it! It would take all of your stress away.",7
S08E13 Chandler Takes A Bath.txt,Chandler,"Honey, it’s 2:00 on a Wednesday and I’m watching Road Rules, how stressed do you think I am?",7
S08E13 Chandler Takes A Bath.txt,Chandler,"Oh! Uh, yeah! Is this a cold pizza talk or a leftover meatloaf talk?",8
S08E13 Chandler Takes A Bath.txt,Joey,"Well, neither.",8
S08E13 Chandler Takes A Bath.txt,Chandler,"Oh my God, what’s up?!",8
S08E13 Chandler Takes A Bath.txt,Chandler,"Oh no-no, no you don’t, just come back.",9
S08E13 Chandler Takes A Bath.txt,Joey,"All right. Okay. You and Monica, friends for a long time, and sure there are rules, but then you went to London. Oh, no, but that’s different. I mean, there are rules there, too! You know what I mean?",9
S08E13 Chandler Takes A Bath.txt,Chandler,Do you?,9
S08E13 Chandler Takes A Bath.txt,Joey,"It was different for you guys! I mean, I mean, you were both in the same place, right?",9
S08E13 Chandler Takes A Bath.txt,Chandler,In London?,9
S08E13 Chandler Takes A Bath.txt,Joey,Yeah.,9
S08E13 Chandler Takes A Bath.txt,Chandler,"Yes. When Monica and I were in London, we were both in London.",9
S08E13 Chandler Takes A Bath.txt,Joey,"You know what? This is a bad idea. Forget it. Forget it, and listen, do me a favor, this conversation was between you and me.",9
S08E13 Chandler Takes A Bath.txt,Chandler,If that.,9
S08E13 Chandler Takes A Bath.txt,Rachel,"Hi! Oh, Ross, don’t forget, we have that doctor’s appointment tomorrow!",10
S08E13 Chandler Takes A Bath.txt,Ross,Right.,10
S08E13 Chandler Takes A Bath.txt,Phoebe,"Hey, are you going to find out the sex of the baby?",10
S08E13 Chandler Takes A Bath.txt,Ross,"No-no, we talked about it. We don’t want to know. All we care about is that it’s happy and healthy.",10
S08E13 Chandler Takes A Bath.txt,Rachel,Yep! Happy and healthy! And cute!,10
S08E13 Chandler Takes A Bath.txt,Ross,And smart!,10
S08E13 Chandler Takes A Bath.txt,Rachel,Popular.,10
S08E13 Chandler Takes A Bath.txt,Ross,With an aptitude for science.,10
S08E13 Chandler Takes A Bath.txt,Phoebe,Are you two talking about the same baby? Hey! Have you started off thinking of names yet?,10
S08E13 Chandler Takes A Bath.txt,Rachel,Oh yeah! I’ve come up with a bunch of ideas!,10
S08E13 Chandler Takes A Bath.txt,Ross,Really? Me too!,10
S08E13 Chandler Takes A Bath.txt,Phoebe,Me too!,10
S08E13 Chandler Takes A Bath.txt,Rachel,Really?!,10
S08E13 Chandler Takes A Bath.txt,Phoebe,"Uh huh! If it’s a girl, Phoebe, and if it’s a boy, Phoebo!",10
S08E13 Chandler Takes A Bath.txt,Rachel,"Okay! I was thinking if it’s a girl, how about Sandrine? It’s French.",11
S08E13 Chandler Takes A Bath.txt,Ross,Huh. That’s a really pretty name for-for an industrial solvent.,11
S08E13 Chandler Takes A Bath.txt,Rachel,"Okay fine, what do you have?",11
S08E13 Chandler Takes A Bath.txt,Ross,"Well, OK, it’s for a boy. Well, I know it’s a little out there, but…Darwin.",11
S08E13 Chandler Takes A Bath.txt,Rachel,"Wow, oh my God, our child will be beaten to death in the schoolyard.",11
S08E13 Chandler Takes A Bath.txt,Phoebe,"Yeah, by Sandrine.",11
S08E13 Chandler Takes A Bath.txt,Ross,You’re just saying that 'cause I said no to your name!,11
S08E13 Chandler Takes A Bath.txt,Rachel,"I’m really, really not.",11
S08E13 Chandler Takes A Bath.txt,Phoebe,How-how about you each get five vetoes?,11
S08E13 Chandler Takes A Bath.txt,Ross,All right.,11
S08E13 Chandler Takes A Bath.txt,Rachel,All right.,11
S08E13 Chandler Takes A Bath.txt,Ross,That sounds fair.,11
S08E13 Chandler Takes A Bath.txt,Rachel,"Yeah! I don’t think you’re going to need it though. Okay, check this out. If it’s a girl, Rain.",11
S08E13 Chandler Takes A Bath.txt,Ross,Veto.,11
S08E13 Chandler Takes A Bath.txt,Rachel,Why?,11
S08E13 Chandler Takes A Bath.txt,Ross,"Rain? Hi. Hi, my name is Rain. I have my own kiln, and my dress is made out of wheat.",11
S08E13 Chandler Takes A Bath.txt,Phoebe,I know her! I bought homemade soap from her at a Dead show!,11
S08E13 Chandler Takes A Bath.txt,Ross,"Okay, how about, for a guy, Thatcher?",11
S08E13 Chandler Takes A Bath.txt,Rachel,"Ross, why do you hate our child?",11
S08E13 Chandler Takes A Bath.txt,Ross,"Fine, you go.",11
S08E13 Chandler Takes A Bath.txt,Rachel,"Okay, James.",11
S08E13 Chandler Takes A Bath.txt,Ross,Huh.,11
S08E13 Chandler Takes A Bath.txt,Rachel,But only if it’s a girl.,11
S08E13 Chandler Takes A Bath.txt,Ross,"Oh, veto. How about—Ooh, I like Ruth! What about Ruth?",11
S08E13 Chandler Takes A Bath.txt,Rachel,Oh! I’m sorry! Are we having an 89-year-old? How about Dayton?,11
S08E13 Chandler Takes A Bath.txt,Ross,Veto. Stewart?,11
S08E13 Chandler Takes A Bath.txt,Rachel,Veto. Sawyer?,11
S08E13 Chandler Takes A Bath.txt,Ross,Veto. Helen?,11
S08E13 Chandler Takes A Bath.txt,Rachel,Veto.,11
S08E13 Chandler Takes A Bath.txt,Phoebe,"Is it me, or is veto starting to sound really good?",11
S08E13 Chandler Takes A Bath.txt,Chandler,Hey.,12
S08E13 Chandler Takes A Bath.txt,Monica,"Boy, do I have a surprise for you!",12
S08E13 Chandler Takes A Bath.txt,Chandler,Sex on the balcony?,12
S08E13 Chandler Takes A Bath.txt,Monica,"No, but someone’s really not going to get over that idea, are they?",12
S08E13 Chandler Takes A Bath.txt,Chandler,What is it?,12
S08E13 Chandler Takes A Bath.txt,Monica,I drew you a bath!,12
S08E13 Chandler Takes A Bath.txt,Chandler,"Honey, I don’t like baths! Could you draw me a picture of us having sex on the balcony?",12
S08E13 Chandler Takes A Bath.txt,Monica,"Please, could you just try it for me? Come on, I used all my best stuff! I-I-I lit some candles. I put on some music. I used bath salts, plus bubble bath! And got you this little plastic Navy ship. So it’s a boy bath!",12
S08E13 Chandler Takes A Bath.txt,Chandler,"Well, this does butch it up a bit.",12
S08E13 Chandler Takes A Bath.txt,Monica,"I swear, if you try it, you will love it!",12
S08E13 Chandler Takes A Bath.txt,Chandler,"All right, if I do this, can we at least discuss sex on the balcony?",12
S08E13 Chandler Takes A Bath.txt,Monica,Absolutely.,12
S08E13 Chandler Takes A Bath.txt,Monica,Bet I know how that discussion’s going to go.,13
S08E13 Chandler Takes A Bath.txt,Chandler,Oh my God.,16
S08E13 Chandler Takes A Bath.txt,Monica,"I told you you were a bath person! Hey, when you get out, maybe I can give you a facial!",16
S08E13 Chandler Takes A Bath.txt,Chandler,I’m going to need a bigger boat.,16
S08E13 Chandler Takes A Bath.txt,Ross,"I don’t think you had an open mind about the name Ruth. I mean, come on, little Ruthie Geller, how-how cute is that?",17
S08E13 Chandler Takes A Bath.txt,Rachel,"Oh, oh my God! I can practically hear the mahjong tiles!",17
S08E13 Chandler Takes A Bath.txt,Ross,"Uh, no. No, we’re not.",17
S08E13 Chandler Takes A Bath.txt,Rachel,But you have it right there in that file? You could tell us whether it’s a boy or a girl? Dayton or Sandrine? Phoebe or Phoebo?,17
S08E13 Chandler Takes A Bath.txt,Ross,"No, no, we want to wait, right?",17
S08E13 Chandler Takes A Bath.txt,Rachel,Right. Right.,17
S08E13 Chandler Takes A Bath.txt,Ross,"What? Rach! Come on, that’s terrible! They’re…uh…they’re babies. They’re-they’re all beautiful.",19
S08E13 Chandler Takes A Bath.txt,Rachel,Third one from the left?,19
S08E13 Chandler Takes A Bath.txt,Rachel,What?!,20
S08E13 Chandler Takes A Bath.txt,Ross,You’re looking!,20
S08E13 Chandler Takes A Bath.txt,Rachel,I didn’t!,20
S08E13 Chandler Takes A Bath.txt,Ross,I saw you!,20
S08E13 Chandler Takes A Bath.txt,Rachel,"Okay fine, I did. But I didn’t see anything, I swear.",20
S08E13 Chandler Takes A Bath.txt,Ross,Shame on you! Ugly baby judges you!,20
S08E13 Chandler Takes A Bath.txt,Rachel,"Okay, but Ross just listen to me…",20
S08E13 Chandler Takes A Bath.txt,Ross,"No, no, no, no! Don’t tell me! I don’t want to know!",20
S08E13 Chandler Takes A Bath.txt,Rachel,"But I couldn’t even if I wanted to, because I don’t know! I swear; I didn’t see anything, and I don’t want to know! It was just a momentary lapse.",20
S08E13 Chandler Takes A Bath.txt,Ross,Momentary lapse. Don’t-don’t you have any self-control?,20
S08E13 Chandler Takes A Bath.txt,Monica,Hello?,22
S08E13 Chandler Takes A Bath.txt,Chandler,"I’m in the bathroom, can you come in here? I think there’s something wrong.",22
S08E13 Chandler Takes A Bath.txt,Monica,You know what? I-I think I’ll wait out here.,22
S08E13 Chandler Takes A Bath.txt,Chandler,I’m in the bathtub.,22
S08E13 Chandler Takes A Bath.txt,Chandler,"I drew my own bath, but I did it wrong! The water’s tepid. The salt didn’t dissolve and is now… lodged places. And the scents I used don’t compliment each other. Eucalyptus and chamomile—Oh!",23
S08E13 Chandler Takes A Bath.txt,Monica,What?,23
S08E13 Chandler Takes A Bath.txt,Monica,"Okay, let’s talk about something else.",24
S08E13 Chandler Takes A Bath.txt,Chandler,"Yeah! Sure, sure. So, what was going on with you today? Oh-oh-oh!",24
S08E13 Chandler Takes A Bath.txt,Monica,"Well, I actually had the weirdest conversation with Joey. He was talking about rules and right and wrong and…",24
S08E13 Chandler Takes A Bath.txt,Chandler,I had the exact same conversation.,24
S08E13 Chandler Takes A Bath.txt,Monica,You did? What was he talking about?,24
S08E13 Chandler Takes A Bath.txt,Chandler,I don’t know! Joey hasn’t had this much trouble getting out words since we saw him in Macbeth!,24
S08E13 Chandler Takes A Bath.txt,Chandler,"All right, let’s break this down. What exactly did he say to you?",25
S08E13 Chandler Takes A Bath.txt,Monica,"Okay, he was talking about rules.",25
S08E13 Chandler Takes A Bath.txt,Chandler,Uh-huh.,25
S08E13 Chandler Takes A Bath.txt,Monica,"Umm, and looking at people differently.",25
S08E13 Chandler Takes A Bath.txt,Chandler,He didn’t say anything about that to me.,25
S08E13 Chandler Takes A Bath.txt,Monica,What did he tell you?,25
S08E13 Chandler Takes A Bath.txt,Chandler,"He was asking all these questions about you, me, and London. And, of course the glue that holds this all together, the rules.",25
S08E13 Chandler Takes A Bath.txt,Monica,"Okay. So you, me and London. Looking at people differently. Maybe he wants to do what you and I did in London with someone.",25
S08E13 Chandler Takes A Bath.txt,Chandler,But what did he mean by rules?,25
S08E13 Chandler Takes A Bath.txt,Monica,Wait a minute! He stopped talking the minute Phoebe came in!,25
S08E13 Chandler Takes A Bath.txt,Chandler,Because he was looking at her differently.,25
S08E13 Chandler Takes A Bath.txt,Monica,"And Phoebe is his friend, so he thinks that would be breaking the rules!",25
S08E13 Chandler Takes A Bath.txt,Chandler,My God! He wants to do it with Phoebe in London!,25
S08E13 Chandler Takes A Bath.txt,Chandler,You don’t say anything.,27
S08E13 Chandler Takes A Bath.txt,Monica,"Why would I say anything? That two of our best friends could start the greatest love affair of their lives! And they would have me to thank, and we could all start having babies?",27
S08E13 Chandler Takes A Bath.txt,Chandler,I’m not going to let you say anything.,27
S08E13 Chandler Takes A Bath.txt,Chandler,"Oh, God!",28
S08E13 Chandler Takes A Bath.txt,Phoebe,"Oh, hey, Monica, I brought back your iron.",29
S08E13 Chandler Takes A Bath.txt,Monica,"Oh, you had that?",29
S08E13 Chandler Takes A Bath.txt,Phoebe,Uh-huh.,29
S08E13 Chandler Takes A Bath.txt,Monica,"I thought I lost it. I got a new one, like, a month ago.",29
S08E13 Chandler Takes A Bath.txt,Phoebe,"Oh, just as well, I broke this one.",29
S08E13 Chandler Takes A Bath.txt,Phoebe,What?,30
S08E13 Chandler Takes A Bath.txt,Monica,Nothing.,30
S08E13 Chandler Takes A Bath.txt,Phoebe,Okay.,30
S08E13 Chandler Takes A Bath.txt,Monica,"I mean, I-I, I really shouldn’t say. I mean, I’m really not supposed to.",30
S08E13 Chandler Takes A Bath.txt,Phoebe,Fine.,30
S08E13 Chandler Takes A Bath.txt,Monica,It’s a humdinger!,30
S08E13 Chandler Takes A Bath.txt,Phoebe,Then it’s really too bad that you can’t tell me.,30
S08E13 Chandler Takes A Bath.txt,Monica,Somebody likes you!,30
S08E13 Chandler Takes A Bath.txt,Monica,No!,31
S08E13 Chandler Takes A Bath.txt,Phoebe,"Well, then tell him to stop staring!",31
S08E13 Chandler Takes A Bath.txt,Monica,It’s Joey!,31
S08E13 Chandler Takes A Bath.txt,Phoebe,Really?! Joey?! You don’t say.,31
S08E13 Chandler Takes A Bath.txt,Monica,Is it something you’d be interested in?,31
S08E13 Chandler Takes A Bath.txt,Phoebe,"I don’t know, I don’t know, I don’t know. You know, I mean, on the one hand, Mother may I? But y’know on the other hand… No. No, I can’t. We’re friends. No, oh, no. I don’t want to risk what we have.",31
S08E13 Chandler Takes A Bath.txt,Monica,"I guess that makes sense. So, you think you’re going to talk to him?",31
S08E13 Chandler Takes A Bath.txt,Phoebe,"Sure, yeah. I mean, it’s Joey. I don’t want him to get hurt. Well, I must say, I am on fire! First Chandler, now Joey!",31
S08E13 Chandler Takes A Bath.txt,Monica,"Not Chandler, just Joey.",31
S08E13 Chandler Takes A Bath.txt,Phoebe,Sure.,31
S08E13 Chandler Takes A Bath.txt,Rachel,Hey.,32
S08E13 Chandler Takes A Bath.txt,Ross,Hey.,32
S08E13 Chandler Takes A Bath.txt,Rachel,You know what? I’ve been thinking about it. I’m really coming around on the name Ruth. I think I would actually consider naming our child that.,32
S08E13 Chandler Takes A Bath.txt,Ross,"Rach, I-I can’t tell you how-how much that means to me! Ohh… Wait a minute. Wait a minute. You-you hated the name Ruth! Why-why would you change your mind? Unless, you know we’re never going to have to use it. You did see the folder. You know it’s a boy!",32
S08E13 Chandler Takes A Bath.txt,Rachel,I didn’t see anything! I actually changed my mind about the name.,32
S08E13 Chandler Takes A Bath.txt,Ross,"I don’t think so! You’re just giving me Ruth so you’ll get to name it when it’s a boy, and that’s when you’ll swoop in and name him Heath or Blaine or Sequoia.",32
S08E13 Chandler Takes A Bath.txt,Rachel,I would—Sequoia?,32
S08E13 Chandler Takes A Bath.txt,Ross,Veto.,32
S08E13 Chandler Takes A Bath.txt,Rachel,Fine.,32
S08E13 Chandler Takes A Bath.txt,Rachel,"But Ross, you want the name Ruth!",33
S08E13 Chandler Takes A Bath.txt,Ross,Not like this!,33
S08E13 Chandler Takes A Bath.txt,Phoebe,Hey.,34
S08E13 Chandler Takes A Bath.txt,Joey,"Hey. Well, what’s up?",34
S08E13 Chandler Takes A Bath.txt,Phoebe,"Umm, Joey, I know.",34
S08E13 Chandler Takes A Bath.txt,Joey,What?,34
S08E13 Chandler Takes A Bath.txt,Phoebe,I knooow.,34
S08E13 Chandler Takes A Bath.txt,Joey,Whaaat?,34
S08E13 Chandler Takes A Bath.txt,Phoebe,I know about your feelings.,34
S08E13 Chandler Takes A Bath.txt,Joey,Oh my God. You do?,34
S08E13 Chandler Takes A Bath.txt,Phoebe,"Yes, and I’m sorry. I-I know things worked out for Chandler and Monica, but that’s very rare.",34
S08E13 Chandler Takes A Bath.txt,Joey,"I know. I know. And this is so much more complicated than it was for those guys. I mean, it’s Rachel for God sakes.",34
S08E13 Chandler Takes A Bath.txt,Phoebe,"For God sakes, it’s Rachel!",34
S08E13 Chandler Takes A Bath.txt,Joey,I know. I know. And she’s not only my friend; she’s my pregnant friend! She’s my pregnant friend who’s Ross’ ex!,34
S08E13 Chandler Takes A Bath.txt,Joey,"What am I going to do? You know, and I keep, I keep trying to get rid of these feelings, y’know? I stayed up all last night and made a list of everything I don’t like about her. You want to hear it?",35
S08E13 Chandler Takes A Bath.txt,Phoebe,Yeah.,35
S08E13 Chandler Takes A Bath.txt,Joey,"She made me switch to light Mayo. That’s it! That’s all I got! And, you know what? It tastes the same and my pants fit better!",35
S08E13 Chandler Takes A Bath.txt,Phoebe,"Joey, I just think you’re getting worked up over nothing. This is probably just a crush.",35
S08E13 Chandler Takes A Bath.txt,Joey,You think?,35
S08E13 Chandler Takes A Bath.txt,Phoebe,"Absolutely! Y’know, you get this rush of feelings, but then it goes away.",35
S08E13 Chandler Takes A Bath.txt,Joey,"Yeah, just a crush! That’s all this is! It’s a crush! I’m Joey; I don’t get deep feelings.",35
S08E13 Chandler Takes A Bath.txt,Phoebe,"That’s right, there you go! Crushes happen all the time! I know I’ve had them for all you guys. Well, except for Ross and Chandler. And I’m sure you’ve had them for us.",35
S08E13 Chandler Takes A Bath.txt,Joey,Not really.,35
S08E13 Chandler Takes A Bath.txt,Ross,"So, I uh… I called the doctor and now we both know the sex of the baby.",37
S08E13 Chandler Takes A Bath.txt,Rachel,What?,37
S08E13 Chandler Takes A Bath.txt,Ross,That’s right. The student has become the master.,37
S08E13 Chandler Takes A Bath.txt,Rachel,"Ross, I swear, I don’t know.",37
S08E13 Chandler Takes A Bath.txt,Ross,"Oh, come on, you know it’s a girl!",37
S08E13 Chandler Takes A Bath.txt,Rachel,A what?!,37
S08E13 Chandler Takes A Bath.txt,Ross,You really didn’t know?,37
S08E13 Chandler Takes A Bath.txt,Rachel,We’re having a girl?,37
S08E13 Chandler Takes A Bath.txt,Ross,No.,37
S08E13 Chandler Takes A Bath.txt,Rachel,That’s what you just said!,37
S08E13 Chandler Takes A Bath.txt,Ross,No.,37
S08E13 Chandler Takes A Bath.txt,Rachel,You said girl!,37
S08E13 Chandler Takes A Bath.txt,Ross,Yes. I’m… I’m sorry. I’m so sorry.,37
S08E13 Chandler Takes A Bath.txt,Rachel,I’m not! We’re having a girl! Sometimes I can’t believe it’s with you—But still! We’re having a girl!,37
S08E13 Chandler Takes A Bath.txt,Ross,I know! I know. You know what? I’m putting Ruth back on the table!,37
S08E13 Chandler Takes A Bath.txt,Rachel,"Oh, yes! We’ll have ourselves a little baby Ruth…",37
S08E13 Chandler Takes A Bath.txt,Ross,Permission to veto.,37
S08E13 Chandler Takes A Bath.txt,Rachel,"Yes, please.",37
S08E13 Chandler Takes A Bath.txt,Monica,Hey.,38
S08E13 Chandler Takes A Bath.txt,Chandler,Do I smell essential oils?,38
S08E13 Chandler Takes A Bath.txt,Monica,"Yeah, I’m going to take a bath. I’m just going to get a magazine.",38
S08E13 Chandler Takes A Bath.txt,Chandler,Okay.,38
S08E13 Chandler Takes A Bath.txt,Monica,What do you think you’re doing?,39
S08E13 Chandler Takes A Bath.txt,Chandler,L-leaving my troubles behind?,39
S08E13 Chandler Takes A Bath.txt,Monica,"I know that you’re new at this, but this is completely unacceptable bath decorum.",39
S08E13 Chandler Takes A Bath.txt,Chandler,"Oh, it’s so hard to care when you’re this relaxed.",39
S08E13 Chandler Takes A Bath.txt,Monica,"Fine, you can have the bath, but I am taking your boat. Now you’re just a girl in a tub!",39
S08E13 Chandler Takes A Bath.txt,Phoebe,"Hi, Bubbles. Manly. Well, I just thought I would drop by and let you know how it went with Joey.",41
S08E13 Chandler Takes A Bath.txt,Monica,She pulled it out of me! She’s like a conversational wizard! How’d it go?,42
S08E13 Chandler Takes A Bath.txt,Phoebe,"Well, you were wrong, he doesn’t like me!",42
S08E13 Chandler Takes A Bath.txt,Monica,What?,42
S08E13 Chandler Takes A Bath.txt,Phoebe,"Yeah! How would you like it if I sent you to Lee Majors’ house and told you that he liked you, and you went down there and you found out that he didn’t like you? How would you feel?",42
S08E13 Chandler Takes A Bath.txt,Phoebe,Really? Lee Majors is hot!,43
S08E13 Chandler Takes A Bath.txt,Phoebe,We’re in the bathroom!,44
S08E13 Chandler Takes A Bath.txt,Joey,Why?,44
S08E13 Chandler Takes A Bath.txt,Monica,"Oh my God! A friend he’s looking at differently, but it’s wrong. It’s Rachel!",46
S08E13 Chandler Takes A Bath.txt,Chandler,You like Rachel?!,46
S08E13 Chandler Takes A Bath.txt,Monica,"Honey, cover it up with the boat!",49
S08E13 Chandler Takes A Bath.txt,Rachel,"No, I was waiting for you!",52
S08E13 Chandler Takes A Bath.txt,Phoebe,Tell us what?,52
S08E13 Chandler Takes A Bath.txt,Rachel,We’re having a girl.,52
S08E13 Chandler Takes A Bath.txt,All,"Oh, wow! Yay! Wow! Hooray! Oh, man!",52
S08E13 Chandler Takes A Bath.txt,Chandler,I’ll…I’ll get you later!,53
S08E13 Chandler Takes A Bath.txt,Monica,"It sure is nice to do this together, isn’t it?",58
S08E13 Chandler Takes A Bath.txt,Chandler,Yeah. And what you’re doing feels so good.,58
S08E13 Chandler Takes A Bath.txt,Monica,I’m not touching you.,58
S08E13 Chandler Takes A Bath.txt,Chandler,You’re not?,58
S08E13 Chandler Takes A Bath.txt,Monica,It’s the salts.,58
S08E13 Chandler Takes A Bath.txt,Chandler,"Oh, sweet Lord. New realms of pleasure!",58
S09E11 Rachel Goes Back To Work.txt,Chandler,Hey!,2
S09E11 Rachel Goes Back To Work.txt,Monica,"Good morning, Tiger! I'm making you a nice big breakfast so you can keep up your strength for tonight. You're gonna get me good and pregnant.",2
S09E11 Rachel Goes Back To Work.txt,Chandler,I've got nowhere to go this morning. I'm unemployed! I don't know what I'm gonna do with my life.,2
S09E11 Rachel Goes Back To Work.txt,Monica,"Well, I just lost my erection.",2
S09E11 Rachel Goes Back To Work.txt,Chandler,"I mean, what am I supposed to do with myself?",2
S09E11 Rachel Goes Back To Work.txt,Monica,You're supposed to find your passion in life. You can be whatever you wanna be now. It's exciting.,2
S09E11 Rachel Goes Back To Work.txt,Chandler,But it's all so overwhelming. I don't know where to start.,2
S09E11 Rachel Goes Back To Work.txt,Monica,"Hey, wait a second. I can help you with this. You just need to be organized. We can make a list of your qualifications, and categorize jobs by industry. There could be folders and files!",2
S09E11 Rachel Goes Back To Work.txt,Chandler,Hey! This is where your hyper-organized-pain-in-the-ass stuff pays off!,2
S09E11 Rachel Goes Back To Work.txt,Monica,I know!!! My erection is back!,2
S09E11 Rachel Goes Back To Work.txt,Phoebe,"Joey, can I have a sip of your coffee and a bite of your muffin?",5
S09E11 Rachel Goes Back To Work.txt,Joey,Okay.,5
S09E11 Rachel Goes Back To Work.txt,Phoebe,"I'm sorry, it's just, I'm a little short on cash.",6
S09E11 Rachel Goes Back To Work.txt,Joey,If you want I could loan you some money?,6
S09E11 Rachel Goes Back To Work.txt,Phoebe,"Oh no, no, no. I learned never to borrow money from friends. No, that's why Richard Dreyfuss and I don't speak anymore.",6
S09E11 Rachel Goes Back To Work.txt,Joey,"Oh, hey, how about this? Wanna be an extra on my show?",6
S09E11 Rachel Goes Back To Work.txt,Phoebe,You could do that?,6
S09E11 Rachel Goes Back To Work.txt,Joey,"Yeah, yeah. The pay is pretty good and you could do it for as long as you need.",6
S09E11 Rachel Goes Back To Work.txt,Phoebe,"Oh my god, I'm gonna be on TV!",6
S09E11 Rachel Goes Back To Work.txt,Joey,"Okay, now. I gotta tell you, being on TV isn't as glamorous and exciting as you think.",6
S09E11 Rachel Goes Back To Work.txt,Phoebe,"Oh, really?",6
S09E11 Rachel Goes Back To Work.txt,Joey,No it is awesome!,6
S09E11 Rachel Goes Back To Work.txt,Ross,Hi guys.,7
S09E11 Rachel Goes Back To Work.txt,Phoebe,"Wow! Hey, why are you all dressed up?",8
S09E11 Rachel Goes Back To Work.txt,Ross,Rachel and I are bringing Emma to Ralph Lauren today to introduce her to everyone. Doesn't she look cute?,8
S09E11 Rachel Goes Back To Work.txt,Joey,She sure does. Why does she have a pink bow taped to her head?,8
S09E11 Rachel Goes Back To Work.txt,Rachel,"Well, because if one more person says ""what a cute little boy"" I'm gonna whip them with a car antenna!",8
S09E11 Rachel Goes Back To Work.txt,Ross,"I think she's gonna be the hit of the office, huh? She's gonna be hotter than peasant blouses and A-line skirts. Can I get a blue bow?",8
S09E11 Rachel Goes Back To Work.txt,Chandler,How long was I in there?,10
S09E11 Rachel Goes Back To Work.txt,Monica,Okay. Let us start with the A's. Advertising.,10
S09E11 Rachel Goes Back To Work.txt,Chandler,Wait. Advertising! That's a great idea!,10
S09E11 Rachel Goes Back To Work.txt,Monica,Don't you want to look through the rest?,10
S09E11 Rachel Goes Back To Work.txt,Chandler,"I don't think I have to hear the rest. Advertising makes perfect sense. Sorry you had to waste all this time, though.",10
S09E11 Rachel Goes Back To Work.txt,Monica,"You call eight hours alone with my label maker wasted time? Ooh, now I get to use my shredder!",10
S09E11 Rachel Goes Back To Work.txt,Chandler,"I mean, I can write slogans. I mean, how hard can it be, right? ""Cheese. It's milk that you chew."" ""Crackers. Because your cheese needs a buddy."" ""A grape. Because who can get a water melon in your mouth?""",10
S09E11 Rachel Goes Back To Work.txt,Monica,"I got one. ""Socks. Because your family's feet deserve the best.""",10
S09E11 Rachel Goes Back To Work.txt,Chandler,Honey? Leave it to the pros.,10
S09E11 Rachel Goes Back To Work.txt,Monica,I actually know someone in advertising. I grew up with this guy who is a vice president at a big agency. Maybe I can get him to meet you? Give me the phone.,10
S09E11 Rachel Goes Back To Work.txt,Chandler,"""The phone. Bringing you closer to people...who have phones.""",10
S09E11 Rachel Goes Back To Work.txt,Monica,"""Marriage. It's not for everybody.""",10
S09E11 Rachel Goes Back To Work.txt,Rachel,That went well. Almost everybody knew that she was a girl.,11
S09E11 Rachel Goes Back To Work.txt,Ross,"Yeah, after you punched that one guy who got it wrong, word spread.",11
S09E11 Rachel Goes Back To Work.txt,Guy,Who the hell are you?,12
S09E11 Rachel Goes Back To Work.txt,Rachel,I'm the hell person whose office this is!,12
S09E11 Rachel Goes Back To Work.txt,Ross,"Good one, Rach.",12
S09E11 Rachel Goes Back To Work.txt,Guy,"I'm Gavin Mitchell, the person who's taken over your job.",12
S09E11 Rachel Goes Back To Work.txt,Rachel,Excuse me?,12
S09E11 Rachel Goes Back To Work.txt,Gavin,"Oh, your baby's so cute. Why did you put a pink bow on a boy?",12
S09E11 Rachel Goes Back To Work.txt,Phoebe,"Joey, look at me! I'm a nurse!",13
S09E11 Rachel Goes Back To Work.txt,Joey,"Yes you are. I think it may be time for my sponge bath. Sorry, I'm just so used to hitting on the extras. So, are you excited about your scene?",13
S09E11 Rachel Goes Back To Work.txt,Phoebe,Yeah! But I'm a little shaky and nervous.,13
S09E11 Rachel Goes Back To Work.txt,Joey,"Oh, relax. Don't be. You'll be fine, you'll be fine. They'll probably just make you stand in the back.",13
S09E11 Rachel Goes Back To Work.txt,Phoebe,"Okay, now. What?",14
S09E11 Rachel Goes Back To Work.txt,Director,And...Action!!,14
S09E11 Rachel Goes Back To Work.txt,Director,Cut! Cut!,15
S09E11 Rachel Goes Back To Work.txt,Phoebe,"I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I'm just a little nervous.",15
S09E11 Rachel Goes Back To Work.txt,Director,"Well, don't be.",15
S09E11 Rachel Goes Back To Work.txt,Phoebe,"Okay, that helps.",15
S09E11 Rachel Goes Back To Work.txt,Director,And...Action!,15
S09E11 Rachel Goes Back To Work.txt,Director,Cut!,16
S09E11 Rachel Goes Back To Work.txt,Director,And...Action!,17
S09E11 Rachel Goes Back To Work.txt,Interviewer,"So, do you have any other question about advertising?",19
S09E11 Rachel Goes Back To Work.txt,Chandler,"No, no. But let me show you what I can do. ""Bagels and donuts. Round food for every mood.""",19
S09E11 Rachel Goes Back To Work.txt,Interviewer,Monica warned me you might do that. I actually think we might have something for you at the agency.,19
S09E11 Rachel Goes Back To Work.txt,Chandler,Really? That's great!,19
S09E11 Rachel Goes Back To Work.txt,Interviewer,It's an unpaid internship.,19
S09E11 Rachel Goes Back To Work.txt,Chandler,"It's funny. When you said ""unpaid"" it sounded like you said ""unpaid.""",19
S09E11 Rachel Goes Back To Work.txt,Interviewer,Come on now. Monica has a good job. And it's not like you have a family to support.,19
S09E11 Rachel Goes Back To Work.txt,Chandler,"Actually, we're trying, and I don't think Monica's gonna wanna postpone it. We're supposed to have sex tonight. Actually, she's probably at home naked right now. I tend to keep talking until somebody stops me. I can just picture her on the bed right now.",19
S09E11 Rachel Goes Back To Work.txt,Interviewer,Stop!,19
S09E11 Rachel Goes Back To Work.txt,Interviewer,Okay.,19
S09E11 Rachel Goes Back To Work.txt,Rachel,"Wait a minute! What do you mean, you're taking over my job?",20
S09E11 Rachel Goes Back To Work.txt,Gavin,"Well, while you were on your baby vacation I was doing your job.",20
S09E11 Rachel Goes Back To Work.txt,Rachel,A vacation? My idea of a vacation does not involve something sucking on my nipples until they are raw.,20
S09E11 Rachel Goes Back To Work.txt,Gavin,Clearly you've never been to Sandles Paradise Island.,20
S09E11 Rachel Goes Back To Work.txt,Rachel,"Alright! Don't get too comfortable there, because I'm back in two weeks! And I want everything back to the way it was. I can't say that I care too much for the way you've rearranged my office.",20
S09E11 Rachel Goes Back To Work.txt,Gavin,I can't say I care too much for that smell you've brought in with you.,20
S09E11 Rachel Goes Back To Work.txt,Rachel,Excuse me?,20
S09E11 Rachel Goes Back To Work.txt,Ross,Rach we have a code brown situation.,20
S09E11 Rachel Goes Back To Work.txt,Rachel,"Can you please, please take care of it for me?",20
S09E11 Rachel Goes Back To Work.txt,Ross,"Alright, but you have to do one sometime.",20
S09E11 Rachel Goes Back To Work.txt,Rachel,Let me just get this straight! So I go have a baby and they send some guy in to do my job?,20
S09E11 Rachel Goes Back To Work.txt,Gavin,"Well, there was talk of shutting down Ralph Lauren all together.",20
S09E11 Rachel Goes Back To Work.txt,Rachel,That's right. You're very cheeky for a temp.,20
S09E11 Rachel Goes Back To Work.txt,Gavin,I'm not a temp. I was transferred here from another department.,20
S09E11 Rachel Goes Back To Work.txt,Rachel,"Oh yeah, what department was that? The Jerk department?",20
S09E11 Rachel Goes Back To Work.txt,Gavin,"Oh, they didn't tell me about your quick wit.",20
S09E11 Rachel Goes Back To Work.txt,Rachel,Did they mention that I'm rubber and you're glue?,20
S09E11 Rachel Goes Back To Work.txt,Rachel,"Oh, hi Mr. Zelner.",21
S09E11 Rachel Goes Back To Work.txt,Rachel,"That's great. So now, Super Gavin, when I come back where are you planning on flying off to?",21
S09E11 Rachel Goes Back To Work.txt,Gavin,"Well, that's up to Mr. Zelner. I'm sure he will make the right decision.",21
S09E11 Rachel Goes Back To Work.txt,Rachel,Today.,22
S09E11 Rachel Goes Back To Work.txt,Gavin,You said two weeks.,22
S09E11 Rachel Goes Back To Work.txt,Rachel,"No, I said today! See, for a superhero, not so much with the listening.",22
S09E11 Rachel Goes Back To Work.txt,Joey,Hey.,23
S09E11 Rachel Goes Back To Work.txt,Phoebe,"Hey. So, what did he say?",23
S09E11 Rachel Goes Back To Work.txt,Joey,"Well, he can be a little rough around the edges, so I'm gonna replace a word he used a lot, with the word ""puppy."" Okay, so he said: ""If your puppy friend doesn't get her puppy act together, I'm gonna fire her mother-puppy ass.""",23
S09E11 Rachel Goes Back To Work.txt,Phoebe,"I'm sorry, I can't do this. I'm not an actor.",23
S09E11 Rachel Goes Back To Work.txt,Joey,"That's right, you're not. You're a nurse. You're Nurse With Tray.",23
S09E11 Rachel Goes Back To Work.txt,Phoebe,Joey.,23
S09E11 Rachel Goes Back To Work.txt,Joey,"No, no. Nurse With Tray doesn't know Joey, she doesn't have time for friends. She gets in that operating room and she carries that tray to the doctor, because if she doesn't, people die!",23
S09E11 Rachel Goes Back To Work.txt,Phoebe,Who dies?,23
S09E11 Rachel Goes Back To Work.txt,Phoebe,"Yes, doctor.",24
S09E11 Rachel Goes Back To Work.txt,Joey,Okay.,24
S09E11 Rachel Goes Back To Work.txt,Director,"Okay, let's try this one more time.",24
S09E11 Rachel Goes Back To Work.txt,Phoebe,"Hang in there, Man With Eye Patch, your tray is coming!",24
S09E11 Rachel Goes Back To Work.txt,Director,And...Action!,24
S09E11 Rachel Goes Back To Work.txt,Director,The rest of the scene.,25
S09E11 Rachel Goes Back To Work.txt,Phoebe,"Okay, from the top, people!",25
S09E11 Rachel Goes Back To Work.txt,Rachel,"Listen. Sudden change of plans. My maternity leave just ended. They told me that if I didn't come back today, they were gonna fire me.",26
S09E11 Rachel Goes Back To Work.txt,Ross,"What? No, that's illegal. I'm gonna have the labor department down her so fast they won't even...",26
S09E11 Rachel Goes Back To Work.txt,Rachel,"Alright, alright. Calm down Norma Rae. They didn't actually say that. I'm just afraid if I don't come back right now this guy's gonna try to squeeze me out.",26
S09E11 Rachel Goes Back To Work.txt,Ross,What about Emma? We don't have a nanny.,26
S09E11 Rachel Goes Back To Work.txt,Rachel,"I know. You know, we're just gonna have to figure out a plan tonight. Can you please just take care of her for today?",26
S09E11 Rachel Goes Back To Work.txt,Ross,Absolutely. Just give me your breast and we'll be on our way.,26
S09E11 Rachel Goes Back To Work.txt,Rachel,"Come on, I don't know what else to do.",26
S09E11 Rachel Goes Back To Work.txt,Rachel,Ross?,27
S09E11 Rachel Goes Back To Work.txt,Ross,Huh?,27
S09E11 Rachel Goes Back To Work.txt,Rachel,You're pretty.,27
S09E11 Rachel Goes Back To Work.txt,Chandler,"Whatever I decide to do, I'm gonna be starting a career from scratch. It's gonna be a while before I make a living at it. Maybe now is not the right time to be starting a family.",28
S09E11 Rachel Goes Back To Work.txt,Ross,So you have to tell Monica you don't want to have a baby right now?,28
S09E11 Rachel Goes Back To Work.txt,Chandler,Yeah.,28
S09E11 Rachel Goes Back To Work.txt,Chandler,"Yeah, Ross is here so...",30
S09E11 Rachel Goes Back To Work.txt,Ross,"Yeah, and I was really hoping that I could hang out. What do you feel like doing?",30
S09E11 Rachel Goes Back To Work.txt,Monica,We're gonna have sex.,30
S09E11 Rachel Goes Back To Work.txt,Ross,I don't feel like having sex. Maybe we can watch a movie or something.,30
S09E11 Rachel Goes Back To Work.txt,Monica,Let me put it this way. We're having sex whether you're here or not.,30
S09E11 Rachel Goes Back To Work.txt,Ross,Pants off Bing!,30
S09E11 Rachel Goes Back To Work.txt,Rachel,"Alright. Now that I'm back, why don't you just fill me in on what you've been up to?",31
S09E11 Rachel Goes Back To Work.txt,Gavin,"Well, I've changed your screensaver from that picture of *Nsync.",31
S09E11 Rachel Goes Back To Work.txt,Rachel,"Hey, they were popular when I left!",31
S09E11 Rachel Goes Back To Work.txt,Gavin,"Also, I've just been working on this big presentation for tomorrow.",31
S09E11 Rachel Goes Back To Work.txt,Rachel,"Well, I should be involved in that, so why don't you get me up to speed?",31
S09E11 Rachel Goes Back To Work.txt,Gavin,That's gonna take weeks. Why don't just let me take care of the presentation?,31
S09E11 Rachel Goes Back To Work.txt,Rachel,"Oh, no no no no. I see what you're doing here, alright, listen, this is my job buddy. Okay, I've had it for five years, and I know how it works, so why don't you just catch me up!",31
S09E11 Rachel Goes Back To Work.txt,Gavin,Fine.,31
S09E11 Rachel Goes Back To Work.txt,Gavin,"Hey, you've been here five years, you figure it out.",32
S09E11 Rachel Goes Back To Work.txt,Ross,Hey.,34
S09E11 Rachel Goes Back To Work.txt,Chandler,Hey.,34
S09E11 Rachel Goes Back To Work.txt,Ross,You have a blue tie that would go with this? Emma spit up on mine.,34
S09E11 Rachel Goes Back To Work.txt,Chandler,"Oh, yeah. But you have to give it back if I get a job. Of course, by that time in the future ties will be obsolete and we'll all be wearing silver jump suits.",34
S09E11 Rachel Goes Back To Work.txt,Ross,Here's an idea. You walk into a room...take a quick scan!,35
S09E11 Rachel Goes Back To Work.txt,Chandler,"Oh god, I have to tell you something. You're not pregnant.",36
S09E11 Rachel Goes Back To Work.txt,Monica,What are you talking about?,36
S09E11 Rachel Goes Back To Work.txt,Chandler,That thing that I have to do to make a baby. I faked it.,36
S09E11 Rachel Goes Back To Work.txt,Monica,What!? You faked it?,36
S09E11 Rachel Goes Back To Work.txt,Phoebe,"Joey, listen. I can't do this, it doesn't make any sense. Yesterday I was a nurse, and today I'm a waitress at a cafe?",38
S09E11 Rachel Goes Back To Work.txt,Joey,"Oh, sometimes we use the same extras for different parts. It's okay.",38
S09E11 Rachel Goes Back To Work.txt,Phoebe,"Well, it's not okay, because I gave a very memorable performance as the nurse. And now suddenly I'm the waitress? That's gonna confuse my fans.",38
S09E11 Rachel Goes Back To Work.txt,Joey,"Maybe you are a nurse, but you moonlight as a waitress.",38
S09E11 Rachel Goes Back To Work.txt,Phoebe,"Uhuh. Because I'm a single mother, supporting my two children.",38
S09E11 Rachel Goes Back To Work.txt,Joey,Nice.,38
S09E11 Rachel Goes Back To Work.txt,Phoebe,Wait a minute. Dr. Drake Ramoray and I work at the same hospital. Wouldn't I come over to say hi to him?,38
S09E11 Rachel Goes Back To Work.txt,Joey,"No, no. See, you and Drake are having a fight.",38
S09E11 Rachel Goes Back To Work.txt,Phoebe,About what?,38
S09E11 Rachel Goes Back To Work.txt,Joey,He slept with you and then never called you.,38
S09E11 Rachel Goes Back To Work.txt,Phoebe,And I just wanted a new daddy for Davy and Becky.,38
S09E11 Rachel Goes Back To Work.txt,Director,"Okay, okay, from the top. And...Action!",38
S09E11 Rachel Goes Back To Work.txt,Man,"So, I'm surprised you agreed to have lunch with me.",38
S09E11 Rachel Goes Back To Work.txt,Director,"Cut, cut! What are you doing!?",39
S09E11 Rachel Goes Back To Work.txt,Phoebe,"Yeah, well, I'm very angry at him, because he slept with me and never called me back.",39
S09E11 Rachel Goes Back To Work.txt,Extra,Me too!,39
S09E11 Rachel Goes Back To Work.txt,Joey,"Oh, calm down! She means on the show! We need some new extras around here!",39
S09E11 Rachel Goes Back To Work.txt,Rachel,"Yes. Emma and I came in a little early to do research on the presentation. I actually made a few changes, but I think I'm caught up on everything. So ask me anything!",41
S09E11 Rachel Goes Back To Work.txt,Gavin,How do you fix the chair?,41
S09E11 Rachel Goes Back To Work.txt,Rachel,"What? I can't do that! I have the baby, and Ross is not gonna pick her up for another hour.",42
S09E11 Rachel Goes Back To Work.txt,Rachel,"Well, there you go. You win, you win. You get to do the presentation, you'll knock 'em dead, no one will ever remember that I worked here, and then Ralph will buy his helicopter, and Super Gavin will just fly right along side of him!",42
S09E11 Rachel Goes Back To Work.txt,Gavin,You can do the presentation.,42
S09E11 Rachel Goes Back To Work.txt,Rachel,"No, I can't, I have a baby.",42
S09E11 Rachel Goes Back To Work.txt,Gavin,I'll watch her.,42
S09E11 Rachel Goes Back To Work.txt,Rachel,Why would you do that?,42
S09E11 Rachel Goes Back To Work.txt,Gavin,"Because you've worked really hard, and it's your job, and you're a little crazy.",42
S09E11 Rachel Goes Back To Work.txt,Rachel,That's really nice.,42
S09E11 Rachel Goes Back To Work.txt,Gavin,I should tell you that crying women make me very uncomfortable.,42
S09E11 Rachel Goes Back To Work.txt,Joey,Please don't fire my friend. Just let me talk to her.,45
S09E11 Rachel Goes Back To Work.txt,Director,"Okay, okay. But this is her last chance.",45
S09E11 Rachel Goes Back To Work.txt,Joey,"Thank you, thank you. How about I do something for you? Tomorrow, I'll bring you a hat, cover up the bald?",45
S09E11 Rachel Goes Back To Work.txt,Joey,"Hey, listen Pheebs. I was just talking to the director, and he was thinking, maybe this time you don't hit Drake, you just wait on the tables?",45
S09E11 Rachel Goes Back To Work.txt,Phoebe,I can't do that. I'm an actor. I have a process.,45
S09E11 Rachel Goes Back To Work.txt,Joey,You're a masseuse. You have a table with a hole in it.,45
S09E11 Rachel Goes Back To Work.txt,Phoebe,"Wait a minute, I see what's happening here. You're threatened.",45
S09E11 Rachel Goes Back To Work.txt,Joey,What?,45
S09E11 Rachel Goes Back To Work.txt,Phoebe,"Yeah, I'm so good in this scene that I'm stealing focus from you. Well, rise to the challenge Tribianni 'cause I just raised the bar. Come join me up here!",45
S09E11 Rachel Goes Back To Work.txt,Monica,You faked it? You couldn't have faked it!,47
S09E11 Rachel Goes Back To Work.txt,Chandler,Oh yes you can. You just make the faces and the noises.,47
S09E11 Rachel Goes Back To Work.txt,Monica,"Guys can fake it? Unbelievable. The one thing that's ours! Besides, why would you fake it when we're trying to have a baby?",47
S09E11 Rachel Goes Back To Work.txt,Chandler,"That's actually why. Look, I'm starting a whole new career now, and I'm not saying that I don't want to have a baby, I'm just saying maybe we could wait a little while.",47
S09E11 Rachel Goes Back To Work.txt,Monica,Like a month?,47
S09E11 Rachel Goes Back To Work.txt,Chandler,Or a year?,47
S09E11 Rachel Goes Back To Work.txt,Monica,"Really, you want to wait a year?",47
S09E11 Rachel Goes Back To Work.txt,Monica,I really wanna have a baby.,48
S09E11 Rachel Goes Back To Work.txt,Chandler,"Yeah, me too. Look, I'll just get my old job back.",48
S09E11 Rachel Goes Back To Work.txt,Monica,"No, I want you to have a job that you love. Not statistical analysis and data reconfiguration.",48
S09E11 Rachel Goes Back To Work.txt,Chandler,I quit and you learn what I do?,48
S09E11 Rachel Goes Back To Work.txt,Monica,"It's just, I think, there's never gonna be a right time to have a baby. I mean, now you're unemployed and in a little while you'll find a new job that'll keep you really busy. There's always gonna be a reason not to do this, but I think once the baby comes, forget about all those reasons.",48
S09E11 Rachel Goes Back To Work.txt,Chandler,I guess. It's always gonna be scary when we have a baby.,48
S09E11 Rachel Goes Back To Work.txt,Monica,"It's gonna be really scary. I mean, god. When we have a baby, there's gonna be so much that we're not able to control. I mean, the apartment's gonna be a mess, I won't have time to clean it. What if the baby gets into the ribbon drawer? Messes up all the ribbons?! What if there's no room for a ribbon drawer, because the baby's stuff takes up all the space!? Where will all the ribbons go!?!",48
S09E11 Rachel Goes Back To Work.txt,Chandler,Should we go make a baby right now before you change your mind?,48
S09E11 Rachel Goes Back To Work.txt,Monica,"Yes, please!",48
S09E11 Rachel Goes Back To Work.txt,Chandler,"Oh, and I promise, I will not fake it this time.",48
S09E11 Rachel Goes Back To Work.txt,Monica,I wish I could say the same. I'm a little shook up!,48
S09E11 Rachel Goes Back To Work.txt,Man,I'm not your brother.,50
S01E04 George Stephanopoulos.txt,Monica,Alright. Phoebe?,2
S01E04 George Stephanopoulos.txt,Phoebe,"Okay, okay. If I were omnipotent for a day, I would want, um, world peace, no more hunger, good things for the rain-forest...And bigger boobs!",2
S01E04 George Stephanopoulos.txt,Ross,"Yeah, see.. you took mine. Chandler, what about you?",2
S01E04 George Stephanopoulos.txt,Chandler,"Uh, if I were omnipotent for a day, I'd.. make myself omnipotent forever.",2
S01E04 George Stephanopoulos.txt,All,"Hey Joey. Hi. Hey, buddy.",3
S01E04 George Stephanopoulos.txt,Monica,"Hey, Joey, what would you do if you were omnipotent?",3
S01E04 George Stephanopoulos.txt,Joey,Probably kill myself!,3
S01E04 George Stephanopoulos.txt,Monica,..Excuse me?,3
S01E04 George Stephanopoulos.txt,Joey,"Hey, if Little Joey's dead, then I got no reason to live!",3
S01E04 George Stephanopoulos.txt,Ross,"Joey, uh- OMnipotent.",3
S01E04 George Stephanopoulos.txt,Joey,"You are? Ross, I'm sorry..",3
S01E04 George Stephanopoulos.txt,Monica,How does she do that?,4
S01E04 George Stephanopoulos.txt,Ross,I cannot sleep in a public place.,4
S01E04 George Stephanopoulos.txt,Monica,Would you look at her? She is so peaceful.,4
S01E04 George Stephanopoulos.txt,Ross,"It's okay, y'know, you just nodded off again.",5
S01E04 George Stephanopoulos.txt,Monica,What's going on with you?,5
S01E04 George Stephanopoulos.txt,Phoebe,I got no sleep last night!,5
S01E04 George Stephanopoulos.txt,Ross,Why?,5
S01E04 George Stephanopoulos.txt,Phoebe,"My grandmother has this new boyfriend, and they're both kind of insecure in bed. Oh, and deaf. So they're constantly, like, having to reassure each other that they're having a good time. You have no idea how loud they are!",5
S01E04 George Stephanopoulos.txt,Monica,"Well, if you want, you can stay with Rachel and me tonight.",5
S01E04 George Stephanopoulos.txt,Phoebe,Thanks.,5
S01E04 George Stephanopoulos.txt,Joey,"...Ninety-five, ninety-six, ninety-seven. See, I told you! Less than a hundred steps from our place to here.",6
S01E04 George Stephanopoulos.txt,Chandler,You got waaaay too much free time.,6
S01E04 George Stephanopoulos.txt,Chandler,"Happy birthday, pal!",7
S01E04 George Stephanopoulos.txt,Ross,"Funny, my birthday was seven months ago.",8
S01E04 George Stephanopoulos.txt,Joey,So?,8
S01E04 George Stephanopoulos.txt,Ross,"So, I'm guessing you had an extra ticket and couldn't decide which one of you got to bring a date?",8
S01E04 George Stephanopoulos.txt,Chandler,"Well, aren't we Mr. ""The glass is half empty.""",8
S01E04 George Stephanopoulos.txt,Ross,"Oh my God, oh- is today the twentieth, October twentieth?",8
S01E04 George Stephanopoulos.txt,Monica,"Oh, I was hoping you wouldn't remember.",8
S01E04 George Stephanopoulos.txt,Ross,Ohhh.,8
S01E04 George Stephanopoulos.txt,Joey,What's wrong with the twentieth?,8
S01E04 George Stephanopoulos.txt,Chandler,Eleven days before Halloween.. all the good costumes are gone?,8
S01E04 George Stephanopoulos.txt,Joey,"The hell with hockey, let's all do that!",9
S01E04 George Stephanopoulos.txt,Ross,What are you doing?,10
S01E04 George Stephanopoulos.txt,Joey,"C'mon, Ross!",11
S01E04 George Stephanopoulos.txt,Ross,"Alright, alright, maybe it'll take my mind off it. Do you promise to buy me a big thumb finger?",11
S01E04 George Stephanopoulos.txt,Chandler,You got it.,11
S01E04 George Stephanopoulos.txt,Rachel,"Look-look-look-look-look, my first pay check! Look at the window, there's my name! Hi, me!",12
S01E04 George Stephanopoulos.txt,Phoebe,"I remember the day I got my first pay check. There was a cave in in one of the mines, and eight people were killed.",12
S01E04 George Stephanopoulos.txt,Monica,"Wow, you worked in a mine?",12

S08E14 The Secret Closet.txt,Monica,No! That’s where we keep the canned goods! Have you completely forgotten everything you learned at orientation?,21
S08E14 The Secret Closet.txt,Monica,"Oh, okay. Here, why don’t you let me do it?",22
S08E14 The Secret Closet.txt,Monica,No reason. I-I keep private things in there.,23
S08E14 The Secret Closet.txt,Chandler,"Oh y’know, I’ve been living here a while and I’ve never seen what’s inside that closet. What is, what is in there?",23
S08E14 The Secret Closet.txt,Monica,Feminine stuff.,23
S08E14 The Secret Closet.txt,Chandler,Don’t try to make me uncomfortable with feminine stuff!,23
S08E14 The Secret Closet.txt,Monica,"Chandler, there is nothing in there that concerns you! If you love me you-you’ll let it go.",23
S08E14 The Secret Closet.txt,Chandler,Fine.,23
S08E14 The Secret Closet.txt,Phoebe,Why won’t you let me massage you?,27
S08E14 The Secret Closet.txt,Monica,Well it’s…I mean I’d just—I’d be self-conscious. You’re my friend; I’d be naked.,27
S08E14 The Secret Closet.txt,Phoebe,Monica! We lived together for years! I’ve seen you naked!,27
S08E14 The Secret Closet.txt,Monica,"That’s different, we were roommates! And when?!",27
S08E14 The Secret Closet.txt,Phoebe,I’m curious about the human body.,27
S08E14 The Secret Closet.txt,Monica,"Hey, come on Phoebe, you can understand why this would be weird for me.",27
S08E14 The Secret Closet.txt,Phoebe,"But I’m a professional! And I’m really good! Look, if you’re uncomfortable we can stop. Just give me a chance, okay. Please?",27
S08E14 The Secret Closet.txt,Monica,"Okay, if it means that much to you…",27
S08E14 The Secret Closet.txt,Phoebe,It does! How would you feel if you couldn’t share your cooking? Or-or imagine how Ross would feel if he couldn’t teach us about dragons.,27
S08E14 The Secret Closet.txt,Monica,Dinosaurs.,27
S08E14 The Secret Closet.txt,Phoebe,"Potato, potaato.",27
S08E14 The Secret Closet.txt,Ross,Hey!,28
S08E14 The Secret Closet.txt,Joey,Hey Ross! The baby’s kicking!,28
S08E14 The Secret Closet.txt,Ross,"Hey, when-when was it kicking? What happened?",30
S08E14 The Secret Closet.txt,Rachel,Last night! I just felt it and I went into Joey’s room and he was sleeping…,30
S08E14 The Secret Closet.txt,Joey,A dreamless sleep.,30
S08E14 The Secret Closet.txt,Ross,"My God, the baby’s kicking. That’s great. Although I…kinda wish I-I would’ve been there to feel the kicking for the first time y’know.",30
S08E14 The Secret Closet.txt,Ross,"Look, I-I don’t want to miss anymore baby stuff. So…Here. Here’s my new pager number, okay? Anytime anything pregnancy related happens use it! I’ll be there! Okay? I don’t care if it’s three in the morning and all you want is ice cream.",31
S08E14 The Secret Closet.txt,Joey,Wow! Can I get a copy of that?,31
S08E14 The Secret Closet.txt,Monica,Yes.,33
S08E14 The Secret Closet.txt,Monica,Nice! Wow Phoebe you are good!,35
S08E14 The Secret Closet.txt,Phoebe,"Stating the obvious, but thank you. And it’s not weird is it.",35
S08E14 The Secret Closet.txt,Monica,No. Ooohh…,35
S08E14 The Secret Closet.txt,Phoebe,"That’s right, you just enjoy.",35
S08E14 The Secret Closet.txt,Joey,"Whoa, Monica runs a pretty tight ship over here. What are you doing?",40
S08E14 The Secret Closet.txt,Chandler,Monica has a secret closet and she won’t let me see what’s in it.,40
S08E14 The Secret Closet.txt,Joey,Why not?,40
S08E14 The Secret Closet.txt,Chandler,I don’t know! What could she possibly be hiding in here that I can’t see?!,40
S08E14 The Secret Closet.txt,Joey,"I don’t know. Ooh, I bet it’s Richard.",40
S08E14 The Secret Closet.txt,Chandler,Why would Monica be keeping Richard in here?,40
S08E14 The Secret Closet.txt,Joey,"Well off the top of my head uhh, maybe she’s having her cake and eating it too. You being the cake and Richard being the too. Or!",40
S08E14 The Secret Closet.txt,Chandler,And here we go…,40
S08E14 The Secret Closet.txt,Joey,"Oh hey whoa-whoa, don’t worry. Okay. When my sisters were pregnant they got every weird feeling in the book, it was always nothing.",42
S08E14 The Secret Closet.txt,Rachel,Really?,42
S08E14 The Secret Closet.txt,Joey,"Absolutely. But, we’re gonna stop by the hospital just to be sure, okay? I’ll page Ross on the way. Come on.",42
S08E14 The Secret Closet.txt,Rachel,Okay. Oh God—Ow!—Oo!,42
S08E14 The Secret Closet.txt,Joey,Hey! So?,44
S08E14 The Secret Closet.txt,Rachel,"Hmm, mild discomfort. So I take it you’ve had one of these Braxton thingies?",44
S08E14 The Secret Closet.txt,Joey,So but everything is normal.,44
S08E14 The Secret Closet.txt,Joey,And-and there’s no danger to her and the baby?,44
S08E14 The Secret Closet.txt,Joey,Calm?! I wasn’t calm! I’ve never been more scared in all my life!,45
S08E14 The Secret Closet.txt,Rachel,But wait you said everything was gonna be okay.,45
S08E14 The Secret Closet.txt,Joey,Well what do I know?! I’m not a doctor!,45
S08E14 The Secret Closet.txt,Rachel,But I—But everything is okay. I’m fine!,45
S08E14 The Secret Closet.txt,Joey,You sure?!,45
S08E14 The Secret Closet.txt,Rachel,"Yes! Yes! I got half a mind to contract that doctor’s uterus though. Mild discomfort, what’s he talking about?",45
S08E14 The Secret Closet.txt,Rachel,"Yeah, everything’s fine!",47
S08E14 The Secret Closet.txt,Ross,"Your page said come to the hospital, what? What was it? What happened?",47
S08E14 The Secret Closet.txt,Joey,Something called Braxton-Hicks contractions.,47
S08E14 The Secret Closet.txt,Ross,"Oh. Oh. Thank God, most women don’t even feel them.",47
S08E14 The Secret Closet.txt,Rachel,"Okay, no uterus, no opinion.",47
S08E14 The Secret Closet.txt,Joey,"Hey uh, what’s with the candy?",47
S08E14 The Secret Closet.txt,Ross,Oh when you beeped me I was on line at the concession stand at the movie theater.,47
S08E14 The Secret Closet.txt,Rachel,Oh you went to the movies by yourself?,47
S08E14 The Secret Closet.txt,Ross,No I—Mona!,47
S08E14 The Secret Closet.txt,Rachel,"Oh, I gotta go back in there.",47
S08E14 The Secret Closet.txt,Ross,What? Why? What’s wrong?,47
S08E14 The Secret Closet.txt,Rachel,"No, everything’s fine. I just gotta go back…",47
S08E14 The Secret Closet.txt,Ross,"No really, you tell me what’s up.",47
S08E14 The Secret Closet.txt,Joey,"Oh hey, don’t worry about it man. Don’t worry about it, no big deal.",49
S08E14 The Secret Closet.txt,Ross,"Yeah but still, I mean it should’ve been me. I’m the dad.",49
S08E14 The Secret Closet.txt,Chandler,There has got to be a way!,52
S08E14 The Secret Closet.txt,Joey,"Easy there Captain Kirk. Oh, do you have a bobby pin?",52
S08E14 The Secret Closet.txt,Joey,Then why do you throw like one?,53
S08E14 The Secret Closet.txt,Chandler,Maybe Monica has a bobby pin.,53
S08E14 The Secret Closet.txt,Joey,"Sure. ""Monica.""",53
S08E14 The Secret Closet.txt,Chandler,"So, how’s the hideously inappropriate crush on Rachel coming?",53
S08E14 The Secret Closet.txt,Chandler,That’s a good idea.,54
S08E14 The Secret Closet.txt,Joey,Yeah.,54
S08E14 The Secret Closet.txt,Joey,"Oh, I just…I feel terrible.",55
S08E14 The Secret Closet.txt,Monica,Hey.,57
S08E14 The Secret Closet.txt,Phoebe,Hey.,57
S08E14 The Secret Closet.txt,Monica,"I gotta tell you, yesterday was amazing. That massage felt so good!",57
S08E14 The Secret Closet.txt,Phoebe,"No-no, I got that.",57
S08E14 The Secret Closet.txt,Monica,"So umm, what do you say we make it a weekly appointment?",57
S08E14 The Secret Closet.txt,Phoebe,"Okay. Okay but you should know though, I’ve raised my rates to $200 an hour.",57
S08E14 The Secret Closet.txt,Monica,Okay.,57
S08E14 The Secret Closet.txt,Phoebe,I mean $500.,57
S08E14 The Secret Closet.txt,Monica,What?,57
S08E14 The Secret Closet.txt,Phoebe,600.,57
S08E14 The Secret Closet.txt,Monica,What’s going on?,57
S08E14 The Secret Closet.txt,Phoebe,"Oh, you make sex noises when you get massaged!",57
S08E14 The Secret Closet.txt,Phoebe,"Yeah, and it really freaked me out! And after a while I even tried to hurt you and it just spurred you on.",58
S08E14 The Secret Closet.txt,Monica,What?! You’re crazy! There’s nothing sexual about the noises I make!,58
S08E14 The Secret Closet.txt,Monica,"Oh my—This is so embarrassing. Oh my God, I’m never gonna get massaged again!",59
S08E14 The Secret Closet.txt,Phoebe,"No, you can’t let this stop you from getting massages! No look, I have, I have lots of clients that make the same noises you do!",59
S08E14 The Secret Closet.txt,Monica,Really?!,59
S08E14 The Secret Closet.txt,Phoebe,"Well not clients, lovers. But let’s just y’know, try it again. Come back and-and we’ll work through it.",59
S08E14 The Secret Closet.txt,Monica,Are you sure?,59
S08E14 The Secret Closet.txt,Phoebe,Yes.,59
S08E14 The Secret Closet.txt,Monica,I guess.,59
S08E14 The Secret Closet.txt,Rachel,Hey Ross! Check it out! I learned a new trick!,61
S08E14 The Secret Closet.txt,Ross,"Hey uh, I brought you some lunch.",61
S08E14 The Secret Closet.txt,Ross,Well yeah!,62
S08E14 The Secret Closet.txt,Ross,What?! What?! Rach what?!,63
S08E14 The Secret Closet.txt,Joey,What’s going on?,63
S08E14 The Secret Closet.txt,Ross,"I made her favorite, tuna salad with pickles.",63
S08E14 The Secret Closet.txt,Joey,Pickle? Pickles make her sick. Giving her pickles is like giving me salad.,63
S08E14 The Secret Closet.txt,Rachel,"Yeah, I’ll be fine. But could someone please make sure that sandwich is gone when I get out there?",64
S08E14 The Secret Closet.txt,Ross,I can’t believe this! I shouldn’t be the one making her throw up!,65
S08E14 The Secret Closet.txt,Joey,Dude relax! It could happen to anyone.,65
S08E14 The Secret Closet.txt,Ross,"Yeah? Not to you, because you know this stuff. I don’t know any of it and I’m the father. I wish I’d be more involved y’know.",65
S08E14 The Secret Closet.txt,Joey,"Hey uh, can I, can I talk to you guys for a second?",66
S08E14 The Secret Closet.txt,Ross,Yeah.,66
S08E14 The Secret Closet.txt,Rachel,What’s up?,66
S08E14 The Secret Closet.txt,Joey,"Uh, sit down. I wanna talk about our situation.",66
S08E14 The Secret Closet.txt,Rachel,Yeah?,68
S08E14 The Secret Closet.txt,Joey,Maybe you two should live together.,68
S08E14 The Secret Closet.txt,Rachel,Are you asking me to move out? Do you not want me here?,68
S08E14 The Secret Closet.txt,Joey,"Oh no-no, no-no I love living with you. It just seems that…if you’re gonna have a roommate, y’know it might as well be the father.",68
S08E14 The Secret Closet.txt,Ross,No I-I-I would love to be around for you and the baby. And we-we can just try it like on a temporary basis.,69
S08E14 The Secret Closet.txt,Rachel,"But Ross, its you and me!",69
S08E14 The Secret Closet.txt,Ross,So? Sure! But it-it wouldn’t be anything romantic. And I’m-I’m dating Mona—Damnit Mona! I was supposed to meet her like an hour ago! What is wrong with me?!,69
S08E14 The Secret Closet.txt,Joey,"All right now, so? What do you think?",69
S08E14 The Secret Closet.txt,Rachel,I don’t know. Is it crazy?,69
S08E14 The Secret Closet.txt,Ross,"No! No it’s not. Joey, this is a smart idea.",69
S08E14 The Secret Closet.txt,Joey,"Well, I was due.",69
S08E14 The Secret Closet.txt,Rachel,"Okay, let’s do it. I’ll move in.",69
S08E14 The Secret Closet.txt,Ross,Really?,69
S08E14 The Secret Closet.txt,Rachel,Yeah.,69
S08E14 The Secret Closet.txt,Monica,Oh no! You weren’t supposed to see this!,74
S08E14 The Secret Closet.txt,Chandler,I married Fred Sanford!,74
S08E14 The Secret Closet.txt,Chandler,"No, honey you’re not sick! Look, I don’t love you because you’re organized, I love you in spite of that.",75
S08E14 The Secret Closet.txt,Monica,Really? You promise you won’t tell anyone?,75
S08E14 The Secret Closet.txt,Chandler,"Yes! And look, now that I know if I got some extra stuff lying around can we, can we share the closet.",75
S08E14 The Secret Closet.txt,Monica,Well…it’s just umm…I’m afraid you might mess it up.,75
S08E14 The Secret Closet.txt,Chandler,Hey.,76
S08E14 The Secret Closet.txt,Joey,Hey.,76
S08E14 The Secret Closet.txt,Chandler,So Rachel’s all moved out huh? How are you taking it?,76
S08E14 The Secret Closet.txt,Joey,"Well uh, I wanted to have a few beers, but uh, I got rid of those because Rachel couldn’t stand the smell of them. But I have thrown back a lot of orange juice with calcium though. And uh, it’s a couple weeks past it’s expiration date, so it’s got a bit of a kick.",76
S08E14 The Secret Closet.txt,Chandler,Are you okay?,76
S08E14 The Secret Closet.txt,Monica,Ohhh.,78
S08E14 The Secret Closet.txt,Phoebe,That’s it. Just relax.,78

S07E22 Chandlers Dad.txt,Ross,Hey!,2
S07E22 Chandlers Dad.txt,Monica,Hey!,2
S07E22 Chandlers Dad.txt,Ross,"Hey uh Mon, I saw the Porsche parked out front, can I get the keys? Thought I’d take that bad boy out for a little spin.",2
S07E22 Chandlers Dad.txt,Monica,"Yeah, well he’s my brother! And plus he drives so slow he could never hurt it.",3
S07E22 Chandlers Dad.txt,Ross,It’s a car Monica! Not a rocket ship!,3
S07E22 Chandlers Dad.txt,Monica,Whatever Ross! Just replace the bulbs in the brake lights after you’re done.,3
S07E22 Chandlers Dad.txt,Ross,Hey!,4
S07E22 Chandlers Dad.txt,Phoebe,Hey!,4
S07E22 Chandlers Dad.txt,Joey,"Saw the Porsche out there Mon, lookin’ good. When do I get to take that baby out again?",4
S07E22 Chandlers Dad.txt,Phoebe,"I’ve never driven it! Okay? Not once! Okay once. Okay, I drive it all the time.",5
S07E22 Chandlers Dad.txt,Monica,"Nice work everybody! So much for the y’know, ""You can drive it, but don’t tell Rachel"" plan!",5
S07E22 Chandlers Dad.txt,Rachel,Wow! I can’t believe you lied to me.,5
S07E22 Chandlers Dad.txt,Monica,"Great! Well Rachel, the reason why I won’t let you drive the Porsche is because you’re a terrible driver. There! That wasn’t about the wedding.",6
S07E22 Chandlers Dad.txt,Ross,Look Rach if-if you want to go for a ride in the Porsche I’ll be glad to take you for a quick spin around the block.,6
S07E22 Chandlers Dad.txt,Joey,"Yeah, you got a couple hours?",6
S07E22 Chandlers Dad.txt,Ross,Whew! That was a brisk ride!,7
S07E22 Chandlers Dad.txt,Rachel,Take the top down did ya?,7
S07E22 Chandlers Dad.txt,Ross,Only way to fly.,7
S07E22 Chandlers Dad.txt,Rachel,Come on Ross give me the keys! Monica does not know what she’s talking about! I am an excellent driver!,8
S07E22 Chandlers Dad.txt,Ross,You’re fast and irresponsible. That adds up to a bad driver.,8
S07E22 Chandlers Dad.txt,Rachel,"Well in High School, that added up to head cheerleader.",8
S07E22 Chandlers Dad.txt,Ross,Did you see the look that girl just gave me? Huh? She must’ve seen me cruising in the bad boy.,9
S07E22 Chandlers Dad.txt,Rachel,I think she’s checking out your beehive Ross.,9
S07E22 Chandlers Dad.txt,Rachel,Gimme the keys!,10
S07E22 Chandlers Dad.txt,Ross,No way!,10
S07E22 Chandlers Dad.txt,Rachel,Well no brush!,10
S07E22 Chandlers Dad.txt,Ross,"Fine! Y’know what? It doesn’t matter, because, if I remember correctly, there is a comb on the floor of the bathroom.",10
S07E22 Chandlers Dad.txt,Monica,"Chandler, we still haven’t gotten an RSVP from your dad.",13
S07E22 Chandlers Dad.txt,Chandler,"Oh! Right. Umm, maybe that’s because I didn’t send him an invitation.",13
S07E22 Chandlers Dad.txt,Monica,Chandler! He’s your father; he should be at the wedding.,13
S07E22 Chandlers Dad.txt,Chandler,I don’t even know the man. Okay? We’re not the close. I haven’t seen him in years.,13
S07E22 Chandlers Dad.txt,Monica,Well what are you gonna do when he finds out he wasn’t even asked?!,13
S07E22 Chandlers Dad.txt,Chandler,"Well he doesn’t have to know! It’s not like we run in the same circles. I hang out with you guys, and he stars in a drag show in Vegas.",13
S07E22 Chandlers Dad.txt,Phoebe,"Ooh, I think I wanna trade circles.",13
S07E22 Chandlers Dad.txt,Chandler,"Trust me, you don’t want him there either. Okay? Nobody is gonna be staring at the bride when the father of the groom is wearing a back-less dress.",13
S07E22 Chandlers Dad.txt,Monica,So what! As long as he’s not wearing a white dress and a veil I don’t care.,13
S07E22 Chandlers Dad.txt,Rachel,My God!,17
S07E22 Chandlers Dad.txt,Ross,What do you think you’re doing?!,17
S07E22 Chandlers Dad.txt,Ross,There is no way I am letting you drive this car! So why don’t you just hand over the keys?,18
S07E22 Chandlers Dad.txt,Rachel,Oh.,18
S07E22 Chandlers Dad.txt,Rachel,"Look Ross, if you’re so freaked out, just get in the car!",19
S07E22 Chandlers Dad.txt,Ross,With you?! Yeah right!,19
S07E22 Chandlers Dad.txt,Rachel,What are you doing?! Get in the front!,21
S07E22 Chandlers Dad.txt,Ross,In the death seat?!!,21
S07E22 Chandlers Dad.txt,Rachel,Oh my…,21
S07E22 Chandlers Dad.txt,Man,Hey guys!,23
S07E22 Chandlers Dad.txt,Joey,Hey!,23
S07E22 Chandlers Dad.txt,Phoebe,Hey sweetie!,23
S07E22 Chandlers Dad.txt,Man,Ready to go?,23
S07E22 Chandlers Dad.txt,Joey,So! You and Phoebe huh? How long have you been going out?,26
S07E22 Chandlers Dad.txt,Man,Over a month.,26
S07E22 Chandlers Dad.txt,Joey,"Wow! Maybe uh, maybe you and I ought to get to know each other a little better.",26
S07E22 Chandlers Dad.txt,Man,"Sure, I’d like that.",26
S07E22 Chandlers Dad.txt,Joey,"So uh, what’s your name?",26
S07E22 Chandlers Dad.txt,Jake,"Yeah, big fan.",28
S07E22 Chandlers Dad.txt,Joey,Me too! There’s a game on Tuesday do you wanna go?,28
S07E22 Chandlers Dad.txt,Chandler,What’s this?,31
S07E22 Chandlers Dad.txt,Monica,It’s your suitcase. We’re going to Las Vegas.,31
S07E22 Chandlers Dad.txt,Monica,"We’re going to Las Vegas to see your dad. It’s time you two talked, and I want to get to know my father-in-law.",32
S07E22 Chandlers Dad.txt,Chandler,Y’know we already went over this and I won!,32
S07E22 Chandlers Dad.txt,Monica,"No you didn’t. Oh and honey just so you know, now that you’re marrying me, you don’t get to win anymore.",32
S07E22 Chandlers Dad.txt,Chandler,Look forget it okay? I don’t want to go. I don’t want to see him. I don’t wanna.,32
S07E22 Chandlers Dad.txt,Monica,"Chandler, look I-I know that your dad embarrassed you. I know…",32
S07E22 Chandlers Dad.txt,Chandler,"No-no all kids are embarrassed by their parents, you’d have to come up with a whole new word for what I went through. When I was in High School, he used to come to all of my swim meets dressed as a different Hollywood starlet. Y’know it’s hard enough to be fourteen. You’re skinny. You’re wearing speedoes—That your mom promised that you would grow into! And you look up into the stands and there’s your dad cheering you on dressed as Carmen Miranda. We was wearing a headdress with real fruit that he will later hand out to your friends as a healthy snack!",32
S07E22 Chandlers Dad.txt,Monica,"Hey, the point is that he was at everyone of your swim meets and he was there cheering you on! Okay? That’s a, that’s a pretty great dad.",32
S07E22 Chandlers Dad.txt,Chandler,He had sex with Mr. Girabaldi!,32
S07E22 Chandlers Dad.txt,Monica,Who’s Mr. Girabaldi?,32
S07E22 Chandlers Dad.txt,Chandler,Does it matter?!,32
S07E22 Chandlers Dad.txt,Monica,"Chandler, you’re not fourteen anymore. Okay? Maybe it’s time that you let that stuff go. If your father’s not at your wedding…you’re gonna regret it for the rest of your life.",32
S07E22 Chandlers Dad.txt,Chandler,"Yeah o-okay, but I’m just doing this for you.",32
S07E22 Chandlers Dad.txt,Monica,Yes!,32
S07E22 Chandlers Dad.txt,Chandler,So I really never get to win anymore?,32
S07E22 Chandlers Dad.txt,Monica,How much did ever really win before?,32
S07E22 Chandlers Dad.txt,Joey,Pheebs!,33
S07E22 Chandlers Dad.txt,Phoebe,Hey!,33
S07E22 Chandlers Dad.txt,Joey,"Listen, you know how uh, when you’re wearing pants and you lean forward I check out your underwear?",33
S07E22 Chandlers Dad.txt,Phoebe,Yeah!,33
S07E22 Chandlers Dad.txt,Joey,"Well, when Jake did it I saw that…he was wearing women’s underwear!",33
S07E22 Chandlers Dad.txt,Phoebe,I know. They were mine.,33
S07E22 Chandlers Dad.txt,Phoebe,"No, it’s not! We were just goofing around and I dared him to try them on.",34
S07E22 Chandlers Dad.txt,Joey,That’s weird!,34
S07E22 Chandlers Dad.txt,Phoebe,I’m wearing his briefs right now.,34
S07E22 Chandlers Dad.txt,Joey,That’s…kinda hot.,34
S07E22 Chandlers Dad.txt,Phoebe,I think so too. And that little flap? Great for holding my lipstick.,34
S07E22 Chandlers Dad.txt,Joey,"Yeah, I wouldn’t know about that.",34
S07E22 Chandlers Dad.txt,Phoebe,And! Y’know what Jake says? That women’s underwear is actually more comfortable. And he loves the way the silk feels against his skin.,34
S07E22 Chandlers Dad.txt,Joey,"Yeah well next thing you know, he’ll be telling you that your high heels are good for his posture!",34
S07E22 Chandlers Dad.txt,Phoebe,There is nothing wrong with Jake! Okay? He is all man! I’m thinking even more than you.,34
S07E22 Chandlers Dad.txt,Joey,"Oh yeah, he looked like a real lumberjack in those pink laceys.",34
S07E22 Chandlers Dad.txt,Phoebe,I’m just saying that only a man completely secure with his masculinity could walk around in women’s underwear! I don’t think you could ever do that.,34
S07E22 Chandlers Dad.txt,Joey,Hey! I am secure with my masculinity.,34
S07E22 Chandlers Dad.txt,Phoebe,Okay whatever.,34
S07E22 Chandlers Dad.txt,Rachel,God. I forgot how much I love driving. I have got to get my license renewed.,36
S07E22 Chandlers Dad.txt,Rachel,I am not horsing around okay? I am Porsching around.,39
S07E22 Chandlers Dad.txt,Ross,"Okay, stay calm. Nothing is going to happen to you, you are not in that much trouble.",41
S07E22 Chandlers Dad.txt,Rachel,Really? You think so?,41
S07E22 Chandlers Dad.txt,Ross,I was talking to myself! You’re going down!,41
S07E22 Chandlers Dad.txt,Monica,I still say that if we had called your dad we coulda gotten better seats.,47
S07E22 Chandlers Dad.txt,Chandler,No! No! I don’t want him to know we’re yet! I’m not sure I’m ready for that. And besides he’s not gonna be too happy to see me either.,47
S07E22 Chandlers Dad.txt,Monica,Why not?!,47
S07E22 Chandlers Dad.txt,Chandler,"I don’t know if I’ve told you this, but he’s kinda tried to get in contact with me a lot over the last few years",47

S07E22 Chandlers Dad.txt,Woman,I don’t think so.,89
S07E22 Chandlers Dad.txt,Joey,Oh! Maybe it’s because I’m on television. I’m an actor on Days of Our Lives.,89

S07E22 Chandlers Dad.txt,Joey,Yeah.,89

S08E16 Joey Tells Rachel.txt,Ross,Rachel who’s carrying my baby? Rachel?,7
S08E16 Joey Tells Rachel.txt,Joey,"Look no, I-I know it’s bad, and I know it’s wrong. Okay? But-but it’s not like anything’s ever gonna happen. Y’know? These-these are just feelings, they’re gonna go away.",7

S08E16 Joey Tells Rachel.txt,Chandler,I think that’s the youngest girl ever to reject me.,13
S08E16 Joey Tells Rachel.txt,Chandler,Oh hey!,14
S08E16 Joey Tells Rachel.txt,Rachel,Hi!,14
S08E16 Joey Tells Rachel.txt,Phoebe,"Hey listen let me ask you, do you believe in soul mates?",14
S08E16 Joey Tells Rachel.txt,Rachel,Oh yes I do. I do. I believe that there is one perfect person out there for everyone. And do you know how you find him? You stop looking for him. That’s why I stopped looking for Russell Crowe. He’ll find me.,14
S08E16 Joey Tells Rachel.txt,Chandler,"No. I mean I believe that uh, certain people are more suited for each other and I believe in falling in love, but soul mates, I don’t think they exist.",15
S08E16 Joey Tells Rachel.txt,Phoebe,"Okay, good.",15
S08E16 Joey Tells Rachel.txt,Chandler,Why?,15
S08E16 Joey Tells Rachel.txt,Phoebe,"Well last night, I met Monica’s.",15
S08E16 Joey Tells Rachel.txt,Chandler,What?,15
S08E16 Joey Tells Rachel.txt,Phoebe,"Yeah, I had a date with this guy, and I swear to God, he is her other half.",15
S08E16 Joey Tells Rachel.txt,Phoebe,Well he’s tall.,17
S08E16 Joey Tells Rachel.txt,Rachel,Uh-huh.,17
S08E16 Joey Tells Rachel.txt,Phoebe,He has brown hair.,17
S08E16 Joey Tells Rachel.txt,Rachel,"Of course, of course.",17
S08E16 Joey Tells Rachel.txt,Chandler,"A tall guy with hair similar to mine, oh unknowable universe!",17
S08E16 Joey Tells Rachel.txt,Phoebe,He works with food!,17
S08E16 Joey Tells Rachel.txt,Rachel,Oh sure. Older?,17
S08E16 Joey Tells Rachel.txt,Phoebe,"Obviously, and he’s British.",17
S08E16 Joey Tells Rachel.txt,Rachel,"Oh, I was just gonna ask!",17
S08E16 Joey Tells Rachel.txt,Phoebe,"Yeah? And, he’s-he’s so centered and mature and confident.",17
S08E16 Joey Tells Rachel.txt,Rachel,"Oh, it’s so sad they never had a chance to meet.",17
S08E16 Joey Tells Rachel.txt,Chandler,"Luckily, the guy she settled for can’t hear what you’re talking about.",17
S08E16 Joey Tells Rachel.txt,Phoebe,"Oh, I’m so sorry. Um, and maybe I’m wrong! I but—y’know I’m gonna go out with him again, I’ll find out more.",17
S08E16 Joey Tells Rachel.txt,Chandler,You believe that this guy is destined for someone else and you’re still gonna date him?,17
S08E16 Joey Tells Rachel.txt,Phoebe,"Well, he may not be my soul mate, but a girl’s gotta eat.",17
S08E16 Joey Tells Rachel.txt,Monica,Hey.,18
S08E16 Joey Tells Rachel.txt,Ross,Hey.,18
S08E16 Joey Tells Rachel.txt,Monica,"I just talked to Joey, I just—I want to see how you were.",18
S08E16 Joey Tells Rachel.txt,Ross,"Oh y’know, I still—I can’t believe it. Joey and Rachel I mean it’s… It’s like you and me going out, only weirder!",18
S08E16 Joey Tells Rachel.txt,Monica,"All right, I know you’re hurting, and-and I want to be supportive, but don’t say that again.",18
S08E16 Joey Tells Rachel.txt,Ross,"Oh my God! What if, what if they get married? Then he’d be the stepfather of my child.",18
S08E16 Joey Tells Rachel.txt,Monica,"Honey, I don’t think that’s something we need to worry about! First of all he’s-he’s never gonna tell her how he feels about her. And even if he did you have no idea how she’d react.",18
S08E16 Joey Tells Rachel.txt,Ross,"Sure, because women never like Joey. Y’know, I think he’s a virgin.",18
S08E16 Joey Tells Rachel.txt,Monica,Joey…he’s not even thinking about going after Rachel!,18
S08E16 Joey Tells Rachel.txt,Ross,He’s not?,18
S08E16 Joey Tells Rachel.txt,Monica,"No! All he’s thinking about is how you’re taking this! I mean, listen it’s totally freaking him out. He’s talking about moving to Vermont.",18
S08E16 Joey Tells Rachel.txt,Ross,Why?,18
S08E16 Joey Tells Rachel.txt,Monica,"Honey I can’t even imagine how hard this must be for you. But, I don’t want you to lose Joey over it. And right now he just needs to know that you’re still his friend.",20
S08E16 Joey Tells Rachel.txt,Ross,"Okay. Okay, I’ll talk to him.",20
S08E16 Joey Tells Rachel.txt,Monica,"All right. Now do it soon, he just asked me how to convert his dollars into Vermont money.",20
S08E16 Joey Tells Rachel.txt,Phoebe,Oh! Hi!,21
S08E16 Joey Tells Rachel.txt,Monica,Hi!,21
S08E16 Joey Tells Rachel.txt,Phoebe,"Umm, Chandler, Monica, this is Don.",21
S08E16 Joey Tells Rachel.txt,Monica,"So, what have you guys been doing?",25
S08E16 Joey Tells Rachel.txt,Don,"Well, we just had a terrible lunch today at Reattica. What is with all the sun-dried tomatoes at that place?",25
S08E16 Joey Tells Rachel.txt,Monica,"I know! What is this, 1985?!",25
S08E16 Joey Tells Rachel.txt,Don,"That’s exactly what I said. Phoebe, isn’t that strange.",25
S08E16 Joey Tells Rachel.txt,Monica,Not really.,25
S08E16 Joey Tells Rachel.txt,Monica,"So Don, what-what other restaurants do you like?",26
S08E16 Joey Tells Rachel.txt,Don,"Well, Octavio, 27&7—Oh! And there’s this great little place, Alessandro’s.",26
S08E16 Joey Tells Rachel.txt,Monica,"Oh my God! That’s my restaurant, I’m the chef there.",26
S08E16 Joey Tells Rachel.txt,Don,You’re kidding me!,26
S08E16 Joey Tells Rachel.txt,Monica,No!,26
S08E16 Joey Tells Rachel.txt,Don,"Your food is fantastic! Wow, I really want to talk to you about your menu, once I get some coffees first. Um, anyone want any?",26
S08E16 Joey Tells Rachel.txt,Monica,"Oh, I’d like a latte. Oh y’know what? If you’re gonna talk about me, I’m gonna go with you.",26
S08E16 Joey Tells Rachel.txt,Chandler,What are you doing?!,27
S08E16 Joey Tells Rachel.txt,Phoebe,Nothing! I swear to God I didn’t know you guys would be here! And the good news is you didn’t believe in soul mates. So…,27
S08E16 Joey Tells Rachel.txt,Chandler,"I believe in tall, handsome strangers who hit on my wife!",27
S08E16 Joey Tells Rachel.txt,Phoebe,"They’re just talking, and y’know what? Just because I think they’re soul mates doesn’t mean anything’s gonna happen.",27
S08E16 Joey Tells Rachel.txt,Phoebe,Yeah?,28
S08E16 Joey Tells Rachel.txt,Phoebe,"Don’t worry, we’ll find you someone else.",29
S08E16 Joey Tells Rachel.txt,Joey,Hey.,30
S08E16 Joey Tells Rachel.txt,Ross,Hey.,30
S08E16 Joey Tells Rachel.txt,Joey,"Look, I understand if you came by to hit me, I deserve it.",30
S08E16 Joey Tells Rachel.txt,Ross,"No, I don’t want to hit you.",30
S08E16 Joey Tells Rachel.txt,Joey,Oh what then? Kick me?,30
S08E16 Joey Tells Rachel.txt,Ross,No.,30
S08E16 Joey Tells Rachel.txt,Joey,Oh now—Hey Ross-Ross! Do you wanna-wanna come in for a beer or something?,32
S08E16 Joey Tells Rachel.txt,Joey,"Do uh, do you got any beer? All-all I got is this melon stuff that Rachel left. I don’t…",33
S08E16 Joey Tells Rachel.txt,Ross,Okay.,33
S08E16 Joey Tells Rachel.txt,Ross,Thank you.,34
S08E16 Joey Tells Rachel.txt,Joey,"Anyway, it uh…look it’ll just…take me a while to get over her, that’s all. I’m not even sure how to do that, I mean I’ve never been in love before so…",35
S08E16 Joey Tells Rachel.txt,Ross,What?! You’re in love with her.,35
S08E16 Joey Tells Rachel.txt,Joey,"Yeah, I thought you knew that.",35
S08E16 Joey Tells Rachel.txt,Ross,"Umm, no.",35
S08E16 Joey Tells Rachel.txt,Joey,"Wow. Hey look, if it helps, I don’t want to feel this way. Honest. I just keep thinking, ""Ah, I’ll get over this."" Y’know? I just—It just keeps gettin’ harder. I don’t, I don’t know what to do. Y’know? What do I do?",35
S08E16 Joey Tells Rachel.txt,Ross,I think you need to tell her how you feel.,36
S08E16 Joey Tells Rachel.txt,Joey,Okay that’s the green stuff talkin’.,36
S08E16 Joey Tells Rachel.txt,Ross,"No, I’m serious. You-you need to find out where she is, because if she’s not where you are, then you can start to move past this.",36
S08E16 Joey Tells Rachel.txt,Joey,But what if uh—and I’m not saying she will be—But…,36
S08E16 Joey Tells Rachel.txt,Ross,If she is where you are then uh…then my feeling weird about it shouldn’t stand in the way.,36
S08E16 Joey Tells Rachel.txt,Joey,Are you sure?,36
S08E16 Joey Tells Rachel.txt,Ross,"Yeah. Look if-if she’s gonna end up with somebody else, the truth is she couldn’t find a better guy. So…",36
S08E16 Joey Tells Rachel.txt,Joey,Hey thanks.,36
S08E16 Joey Tells Rachel.txt,Ross,So when do you think you’re gonna talk to her?,36
S08E16 Joey Tells Rachel.txt,Joey,Oh my God I have to tell her! I haven’t even thought about what I will say. What should I say?,36
S08E16 Joey Tells Rachel.txt,Ross,"I’m understanding, but let’s not get carried away.",36
S08E16 Joey Tells Rachel.txt,Don,…so I’ve been slowly phasing out the wine importing and focusing more on the cheese side of things.,39
S08E16 Joey Tells Rachel.txt,Chandler,"Cheese you say? That’s some pretty smelly work, huh Don?",39
S08E16 Joey Tells Rachel.txt,Don,Excuse me?,39
S08E16 Joey Tells Rachel.txt,Chandler,"Cheese, it’s smelly. You must smell a lot of the time too.",39
S08E16 Joey Tells Rachel.txt,Don,"Uh, not really. But when it comes to cheese, I’m one of the people who thinks the smellier the better.",39
S08E16 Joey Tells Rachel.txt,Monica,"Me too! Yeah, Chandler can’t stand it. He won’t even allow me to have blue cheese in the house.",39
S08E16 Joey Tells Rachel.txt,Don,"Well if you where ever enter the Loire valley let me know, I’ve got a great little villa you can stay at.",41
S08E16 Joey Tells Rachel.txt,Chandler,Is it made of cheese?,41
S08E16 Joey Tells Rachel.txt,Don,"No. But God, a house made of cheese, wouldn’t that be incredible?!",41
S08E16 Joey Tells Rachel.txt,Monica,I’d move in tomorrow!,41
S08E16 Joey Tells Rachel.txt,Phoebe,I’m so sorry.,42
S08E16 Joey Tells Rachel.txt,Chandler,What do we do?,42
S08E16 Joey Tells Rachel.txt,Phoebe,"I don’t know, they both want to live in a house of cheese! I don’t know how you fight that.",42
S08E16 Joey Tells Rachel.txt,Rachel,Joey? What’s up?,44
S08E16 Joey Tells Rachel.txt,Joey,"I uh, I just came by because I-I want to talk to you about something.",44
S08E16 Joey Tells Rachel.txt,Rachel,Okay what’s up?,44
S08E16 Joey Tells Rachel.txt,Joey,Here? In the hall? What are we animals?,44
S08E16 Joey Tells Rachel.txt,Rachel,"Well honey, I’m late for a meeting. So can you just make it quick?",44
S08E16 Joey Tells Rachel.txt,Joey,"Okay umm, I just came by to tell you that I…want to have dinner with you tonight. That’s all.",44
S08E16 Joey Tells Rachel.txt,Monica,I’d like to have Don and Phoebe over. Wouldn’t that be nice?,47
S08E16 Joey Tells Rachel.txt,Chandler,"Sure, why don’t you set it up. I’ll just be over here, browsing through the personals.",47
S08E16 Joey Tells Rachel.txt,Monica,Are you okay? You’ve been acting weird all afternoon.,47
S08E16 Joey Tells Rachel.txt,Chandler,"Yeah, fine. Fine. Not perfect!! But good enough.",47
S08E16 Joey Tells Rachel.txt,Monica,Jeez! What is with you?,47
S08E16 Joey Tells Rachel.txt,Chandler,"I’m sorry, did you say cheese?",47
S08E16 Joey Tells Rachel.txt,Monica,"All right, what’s going on?",47
S08E16 Joey Tells Rachel.txt,Chandler,"Phoebe thinks you and Don are soul mates, and I don’t believe in that kind of stuff. But then you two totally get along. So look, I won’t stand in your way if you want to run off with Don and live in a house of cheese.",47
S08E16 Joey Tells Rachel.txt,Monica,"Chandler, you don’t believe in soul mates?",47
S08E16 Joey Tells Rachel.txt,Monica,I don’t believe in soul mates either.,48
S08E16 Joey Tells Rachel.txt,Chandler,You don’t?,48
S08E16 Joey Tells Rachel.txt,Monica,No. I don’t think that you and I were destined to end up together. I think that we fell in love and work hard at our relationship. Some days we work really hard.,48
S08E16 Joey Tells Rachel.txt,Chandler,So you…you don’t want to live with Don in a cheese house?,48
S08E16 Joey Tells Rachel.txt,Monica,"No, I’ve had second thoughts about that. Do you realize how hard that would be to clean?",48
S08E16 Joey Tells Rachel.txt,Chandler,I love you.,48
S08E16 Joey Tells Rachel.txt,Monica,I know.,48
S08E16 Joey Tells Rachel.txt,Rachel,"No. Not-not for me, but why don’t you take off your sweater?",52
S08E16 Joey Tells Rachel.txt,Joey,"I would, but this is a nice place and my T-shirt has a picture of Calvin doing Hobbs.",52
S08E16 Joey Tells Rachel.txt,Rachel,Oh my God! Really?! Can I see it?,52
S08E16 Joey Tells Rachel.txt,Rachel,"Huh. Wow, I wouldn’t think Hobbs would like that so much.",53
S08E16 Joey Tells Rachel.txt,Joey,Uh… How long have we known each other?,53
S08E16 Joey Tells Rachel.txt,Rachel,"Um, seven…e-e-eight, eight years. Wow.",53
S08E16 Joey Tells Rachel.txt,Joey,"Uh-huh, long time.",53
S08E16 Joey Tells Rachel.txt,Rachel,Yeah.,53
S08E16 Joey Tells Rachel.txt,Joey,But over the past few weeks…,53

S09E07 Rosss Inappropriate Song.txt,Monica,Why in the world would you take this tape and and why would you watch it?,61
S09E07 Rosss Inappropriate Song.txt,Chandler,"Because that's who I am, okay? I'm sure a mature man like Richard could see a tape like that and it wouldn't bother him. Just'd be another saucy anecdote for him to share at his men's club over brandy and moustaches.",61
S09E07 Rosss Inappropriate Song.txt,Monica,Is all this about you not being able to grow a moustache?,61
S09E07 Rosss Inappropriate Song.txt,Chandler,This is about you and Richard. He's clearly not over you. He keeps a tape so he can... look at it whenever he wants.,61

S09E07 Rosss Inappropriate Song.txt,Mike,"So what? I mean if even I can get past that, it shouldn't bother you. And you don't have to like her. You just have to accept the fact that I do. I mean, if you even can't be civil to the woman I love...",66
S09E07 Rosss Inappropriate Song.txt,Phoebe,Yeah... The woman you what?,67
S09E07 Rosss Inappropriate Song.txt,Phoebe,I love you too...,68

S09E10 Christmas In Tulsa.txt,Monica,Wendy? -- That sounds like a girl's name.,47
S09E10 Christmas In Tulsa.txt,Chandler,It is. Did I... not tell you about her?,47
S09E10 Christmas In Tulsa.txt,Monica,"Umhmm, umhmm, about the time you told me about New Year's Eve. Where is everybody else?",47
S09E10 Christmas In Tulsa.txt,Chandler,I sent them home.,47

S09E10 Christmas In Tulsa.txt,Wendy,"Seriously? Happily married. So that phone call before, that was ... happy?",64
S09E10 Christmas In Tulsa.txt,Chandler,"Well look, it's not easy to spend this much time apart, you know. She's entitled to be a little paranoid... or, in this case: right on money! ... You know, she's amazing, and beautiful, and smart, and if she were here right now, ...she'd kick your ass. Look, you're a really nice person... ham stealing and adultery aside. But, what I have with my wife is pretty great, so nothing is ever gonna happen between us.",64
S09E10 Christmas In Tulsa.txt,Wendy,"Okay, let me ask you something: if what you and your wife have is so great, then why are you spending Christmas with me?",64
S09E10 Christmas In Tulsa.txt,Chandler,"I mean, you were the most beautiful woman in the room tonight!",67
S09E10 Christmas In Tulsa.txt,Monica,Really?,67
S09E10 Christmas In Tulsa.txt,Monica,"Well, not anymore.",68
S09E10 Christmas In Tulsa.txt,Chandler,But we don't do that.,68
S09E10 Christmas In Tulsa.txt,Monica,"I know, I just thought it would be fun.",68
S09E10 Christmas In Tulsa.txt,Chandler,How drunk are you?,68
S09E10 Christmas In Tulsa.txt,Monica,Drunk enough that I know I wanna do this. Not so drunk that you should feel guilty about taking advantage.,68
S09E10 Christmas In Tulsa.txt,Monica,Okay!,69
S09E10 Christmas In Tulsa.txt,Chandler,What?,71
S09E10 Christmas In Tulsa.txt,Monica,This doesn't feel weird!,71

S09E10 Christmas In Tulsa.txt,Chandler,Two!,73
S09E10 Christmas In Tulsa.txt,Monica,Two!,73
S09E10 Christmas In Tulsa.txt,Chandler,Well I think it's safe to say that our friendship is effectively ruined.,74
S09E10 Christmas In Tulsa.txt,Monica,"Eh, we weren't that close anyway!",74
S09E10 Christmas In Tulsa.txt,Chandler,"So, are you really gonna go out with that nurse man?",77
S09E10 Christmas In Tulsa.txt,Monica,"Well uh, you and I are just goofing around, I thought, why not just goof around with him.",77
S09E10 Christmas In Tulsa.txt,Chandler,"Y'know, I don't know if you've ever looked up the term goofing around in the dictionary... Well, I have, and the technical definition is, two friends who care a lot about each other and have amazing sex and just wanna spend more time together. But if you have this new fangled dictionary that gets you made at me, then we have to, y'know, get you my original dictionary. I am *so* bad at this.",77
S09E10 Christmas In Tulsa.txt,Monica,I think you're better than you think you are.,77
S09E10 Christmas In Tulsa.txt,Chandler,"Really? Okay, so...",77
S09E10 Christmas In Tulsa.txt,Chandler,"Y'know, I sensed that I should stop. So we're okay?",78
S09E10 Christmas In Tulsa.txt,Chandler,Right!,79
S09E10 Christmas In Tulsa.txt,Monica,"I can't get married until I get something old, something new, something borrowed, and something blue.",81
S09E10 Christmas In Tulsa.txt,Monica,You're so efficient. I love you!,82
S09E10 Christmas In Tulsa.txt,Monica,"No-no-no, wait! We need something old!",83
S09E10 Christmas In Tulsa.txt,Chandler,"Oh, okay, I have condom in my wallet that I've had since I was twelve.",83
S09E10 Christmas In Tulsa.txt,Monica,That'll work!,83
S09E10 Christmas In Tulsa.txt,Chandler,I don't think so.,83
S09E10 Christmas In Tulsa.txt,Monica,"Okay, now we just need something borrowed!",83
S09E10 Christmas In Tulsa.txt,Monica,That's stealing!,84
S09E10 Christmas In Tulsa.txt,Chandler,"No, we'll-we'll bring it back! Just put it under your dress.",84
S09E10 Christmas In Tulsa.txt,Monica,"Listen umm, I've been thinking, it's not fair for me to ask you to spend all of your money on our wedding. I mean, you work, you work really hard for that.",89
S09E10 Christmas In Tulsa.txt,Chandler,Ehh.,89
S09E10 Christmas In Tulsa.txt,Monica,"Eh, you work for that.",89
S09E10 Christmas In Tulsa.txt,Chandler,"Look, I thought about it too, and I'm sorry. I think we should spend all of the money on the wedding.",89

S02E03 Heckles Dies.txt,Ross,"Ok, Pheebs. See how I'm making these little toys move? Opposable thumbs. Without evolution, how do you explain opposable thumbs?",3

S02E03 Heckles Dies.txt,Phoebe,"Ok, Ross, could you just open your mind like this much, ok? Wasn't there a time when the brightest minds in the world believed that the world was flat? And, up until like what, 50 years ago, you all thought the atom was the smallest thing, until you split it open, and this like, whole mess of crap came out. Now, are you telling me that you are so unbelievably arrogant that you can't admit that there's a teeny tiny possibility that you could be wrong about this?",4

S01E21 The Fake Monica.txt,Teacher,You don't observe a dance class. You dance a dance class. Spare shoes are over there.,19
S01E21 The Fake Monica.txt,Rachel,What does she mean?,19
S01E21 The Fake Monica.txt,Monica,"Okay, d'y'see anybody you think could be me?",20

S01E21 The Fake Monica.txt,Monica,"Okay, I'm not getting this!",23
S01E21 The Fake Monica.txt,Monica,Did you ever feel like sometimes you are just so unbelievably uncoordinated?,24
S01E21 The Fake Monica.txt,Rachel,What? You just click when they click.,25
S01E21 The Fake Monica.txt,Teacher,"Alright people, now everyone grab a partner.",25

S01E21 The Fake Monica.txt,Teacher,"Well that's all right, you can come up to the front and dance with me.",26
S01E21 The Fake Monica.txt,Monica,Why don't I just take off my clothes and have a nightmare.,26
S01E21 The Fake Monica.txt,Woman,"It's okay, it's okay, I'm here, I'm here. Sorry I'm late, okay, here I am. Who's the new tense girl?",27
S01E21 The Fake Monica.txt,Teacher,She's your partner.,27

S01E21 The Fake Monica.txt,Joey,Where've you been?,31
S01E21 The Fake Monica.txt,Ross,At the vet.,31
S01E21 The Fake Monica.txt,Chandler,"She's not gonna make you wear one of those big plastic cones, is she?",31
S01E21 The Fake Monica.txt,Ross,She says Marcel's humping thing's not a phase. Apparently he's reached sexual maturity.,31
S01E21 The Fake Monica.txt,Ross,"She says as time goes on, he's gonna start getting agressive and violent.",32
S01E21 The Fake Monica.txt,Chandler,So what does this mean?,32
S01E21 The Fake Monica.txt,Ross,I'm gonna have to give him up.,32
S01E21 The Fake Monica.txt,Joey,"I can't believe it, Ross. This sucks!",33
S01E21 The Fake Monica.txt,Chandler,"I don't get it, I mean, you just got him. How can he be an adult already?",33
S01E21 The Fake Monica.txt,Ross,"I know. I know. I mean, one day, he's this little thing, and before you know it, he's this little thing I can't get off my leg.",33
S01E21 The Fake Monica.txt,Joey,Isn't there any way you can keep him?,33
S01E21 The Fake Monica.txt,Ross,"No, no. The vet says unless he's in a place where he has regular access to some... monkey lovin,' he's just gonna get vicious. I've just gotta get him into a zoo.",33
S01E21 The Fake Monica.txt,Joey,How do you get a monkey into a zoo?,33
S01E21 The Fake Monica.txt,Chandler,"I know that one! ...No, that's Popes into a Volkswagen.",33
S01E21 The Fake Monica.txt,Ross,"Well, we're applying to a lot of them. Naturally our first choice would be one of the bigger state zoos, y'know, like, uh, San Diego... right? But that might just be a pipe dream, because, y'know, he's out of state. Uh, my vet, uh, knows someone at Miami, so that's a possibility.",33
S01E21 The Fake Monica.txt,Chandler,"Yeah, but that's like two blocks away from the beach. I mean, it's a total party zoo.",33
S01E21 The Fake Monica.txt,Phoebe,"Hey. We found her, we found the girl.",34
S01E21 The Fake Monica.txt,Chandler,What?,34
S01E21 The Fake Monica.txt,Joey,Did you call the cops?,34
S01E21 The Fake Monica.txt,Rachel,Nope. We took her to lunch.,34
S01E21 The Fake Monica.txt,Chandler,Ah. Your own brand of vigilante justice.,34
S01E21 The Fake Monica.txt,Ross,What?! Are you insane? This woman stole from you. She stole. She's a stealer.,34
S01E21 The Fake Monica.txt,Monica,"Y'know what? After you're with this woman for like ten minutes, you forget all that. I mean, she is this astounding person, with this, with this amazing spirit.",34
S01E21 The Fake Monica.txt,Ross,"Yeah, which she probably stole from some cheerleader.",34
S01E21 The Fake Monica.txt,Chandler,...Take off their hats!,34
S01E21 The Fake Monica.txt,Phoebe,Popes in a Volkswagen! ...I love that joke.,34
S01E21 The Fake Monica.txt,Rachel,No way. No way did you do this.,35
S01E21 The Fake Monica.txt,Monica,It was so wild. We told them we were the Gunnersens in room six fifteen. Only to find out the Boston Celtics had taken over the entire sixth floor!,35
S01E21 The Fake Monica.txt,Monica,...They threw us out! I was thrown out of a hotel! Me!,35
S01E21 The Fake Monica.txt,Monica,'Scuse me?,36
S01E21 The Fake Monica.txt,Monica,"Nononononono. Think who you're dealing with here. I mean, I'm not like you. I-I can't even stand in front of a tap class.",36
S01E21 The Fake Monica.txt,Monica,What?,36
S01E21 The Fake Monica.txt,Monica,"Right. Till I bought a blow dryer, then I was shunned.",36
S01E21 The Fake Monica.txt,Monica,Uh-huh.,36
S01E21 The Fake Monica.txt,Monica,Wow. Then I would definitely not recommend Mrs. Doubtfire.,36
S01E21 The Fake Monica.txt,Phoebe,I'd say that chair's taking the brunt.,38
S01E21 The Fake Monica.txt,Ross,"Marcel! Marcel! Marcel, no! Good boy. See, how can nobody want him?",38
S01E21 The Fake Monica.txt,Rachel,"Oh, somebody will.",38
S01E21 The Fake Monica.txt,Chandler,You're kidding.,39
S01E21 The Fake Monica.txt,Joey,Apparently he was this Russian dictator who slaughtered all these people. You'd think you would've known that!,39
S01E21 The Fake Monica.txt,Chandler,"Y'know, you'd think I would've.",39
S01E21 The Fake Monica.txt,Joey,Phoebe. Whaddyou think a good stage name for me would be?,39
S01E21 The Fake Monica.txt,Phoebe,...Flame Boy.,39
S01E21 The Fake Monica.txt,Ross,Where exactly is your zoo?,40
S01E21 The Fake Monica.txt,Ross,Yes.,40
S01E21 The Fake Monica.txt,Ross,"No-no, he's, he's very docile.",40
S01E21 The Fake Monica.txt,Ross,"Well I, I don't know. Why?",40
S01E21 The Fake Monica.txt,Ross,"He can hold a banana, if that's whatcha mean...",40
S01E21 The Fake Monica.txt,Ross,Why- why- why would he need a blade?,40
S01E21 The Fake Monica.txt,Joey,"We, we come back from our walk and the- the phone was ringing...",41
S01E21 The Fake Monica.txt,Chandler,...He's in.,41
S01E21 The Fake Monica.txt,Ross,"He's in! Oh, did you hear that, Marcel? San Diego. San Diego!",41
S01E21 The Fake Monica.txt,Monica,Yo- hooo!,42

S01E21 The Fake Monica.txt,Monica,Monica and I just crashed an embassy party.,42
S01E21 The Fake Monica.txt,Rachel,Are you drunk?!,42
S01E21 The Fake Monica.txt,Rachel,"Oh God, oh. Great, Monica, y'know what, you could've called, I have been up here, I've been worried...",43
S01E21 The Fake Monica.txt,Rachel,Monica? Monica!,44
S01E21 The Fake Monica.txt,Monica,Water rules!,44
S01E21 The Fake Monica.txt,Rachel,"Yes, yes, it does. Okay, look, the restaurant called, they wanna know if you're gonna be showing up for work?",44
S01E21 The Fake Monica.txt,Monica,Nope. Going to the Big Apple Circus today.,44
S01E21 The Fake Monica.txt,Rachel,"Okay Monica, what are you doing? You're gonna lose your job! This is not you!",44
S01E21 The Fake Monica.txt,Monica,"No, it is me! Y'know, I'm not just the person who needs to fluff the pillows and pay the bills as soon as they come in! Y'know, when I'm with her, I am so much more than that. I'm- I'm Monana!",44
S01E21 The Fake Monica.txt,Rachel,"Hello? Yes, she is, hold on a second, please. Monana, it's for you, the credit card people.",45
S01E21 The Fake Monica.txt,Monica,Helloooo? Yeah. Oh my God. Thanks.,45

S01E21 The Fake Monica.txt,Monica,"I want you to know, it wasn't me who turned you in.",46
S01E21 The Fake Monica.txt,Monica,"No, thank you! You have given me so much! I mean, if it wasn't for you, I would never have gotten to sing Memories on the stage at the Wintergarden Theater!",46
S01E21 The Fake Monica.txt,Monica,"I just can't believe you're in here. I mean, what am I gonna do without you? Who's gonna crash the embassy parties with me? Who's gonna take me to the Big Apple Circus?",46
S01E21 The Fake Monica.txt,Monica,"Well, not... worried, just... wondering.",46
S01E21 The Fake Monica.txt,Monica,Not necessarily...,46
S01E21 The Fake Monica.txt,Monica,"Um, I'm not actually Amish.",46
S01E21 The Fake Monica.txt,Teacher,You by the door. In or out?,47

S07E14 They All Turn Thirty.txt,Ross,"How hot do I look in this, huh?!",20
S07E14 They All Turn Thirty.txt,Chandler,"Ross, a sports car? Wouldn’t it have been cheaper to just stuff a sock down there?",20
S07E14 They All Turn Thirty.txt,Ross,That’s not what this is about okay? I-I am a sports car enthusiast. I have always been into cars.,20
S07E14 They All Turn Thirty.txt,Joey,"Hey, what’s the horsepower on this thing?",20

S07E14 They All Turn Thirty.txt,Monica,"All right Rach, for what it’s worth, I think that you’re doing great. I mean y’know let’s face it, no one handles this well.",30
S07E14 They All Turn Thirty.txt,Phoebe,Least of all you.,30
S07E14 They All Turn Thirty.txt,Tag,Why? What you’d do?,30

S07E14 They All Turn Thirty.txt,Phoebe,Yay! I love drunk Monica!,73
S07E14 They All Turn Thirty.txt,Phoebe,"Ohh! All right! All right. Here’s what we’ll do, I’ll get twice as drunk as Monica and then no one’s will even notice her.",75
S07E14 They All Turn Thirty.txt,Rachel,What’s-what’s going on? Phil’s really pissed!,76
S07E14 They All Turn Thirty.txt,Chandler,Monica’s wasted.,76
S07E14 They All Turn Thirty.txt,Ross,Maybe that will liven up this party.,76
S07E14 They All Turn Thirty.txt,Rachel,"Okay, but taking care of a drunk, naked woman seems like a job for Joey.",77
S07E14 They All Turn Thirty.txt,Rachel,Ahh!,80

S07E14 They All Turn Thirty.txt,Rachel,Okay! Y’know what? I realized it was stupid to get upset about not having a husband and kids. All I really needed was a plan. See I wanna have three kids…,89
S07E14 They All Turn Thirty.txt,Phoebe,"Oh let me guess, and you wanna have them all at the same time and you wanna have them for your brother.",89
S07E14 They All Turn Thirty.txt,Rachel,As I was saying… I should probably have the first of the three kids by the time I’m 35 which gives me five years. I love this plan! I wanna marry this plan!,89
S07E14 They All Turn Thirty.txt,Phoebe,"If you could do that, I’d marry the hippity-hop.",89
S07E14 They All Turn Thirty.txt,Rachel,"So, if I wanna have my kid when I’m 35, I don’t have to get pregnant until I’m 34. Which gives Prada four years to start making maternity clothes! Oh wait, but I do want to be married for a year before I get pregnant…",89
S07E14 They All Turn Thirty.txt,Rachel,"No, so I don’t have to get married until I’m 33! That’s three years, that’s three whole years—Oh, wait a minute though. I’ll need a year and a half to plan the wedding, and I’d like to know the guy for a year, year and a half before we get engaged… Which means I need to meet the guy by the time I’m thirty.",90
S07E14 They All Turn Thirty.txt,Rachel,"No! Ross, no! It is not fine! Eh-eh-according to my plan I should already be with the guy I wanna marry!",91
S07E14 They All Turn Thirty.txt,Joey,Will you quit hoggin’ it!,92
S07E14 They All Turn Thirty.txt,Ross,I really wish that you wouldn’t.,100
S07E14 They All Turn Thirty.txt,Chandler,Pheebs!!,102
S07E14 They All Turn Thirty.txt,Phoebe,Don’t you see? Everyone’s looking at me! The plan’s working! I didn’t even have to take off my top yet!,102
S07E14 They All Turn Thirty.txt,Ross,Come on!,102
S07E14 They All Turn Thirty.txt,All,Come on! Speech!,102
S07E14 They All Turn Thirty.txt,Monica,I-I-I wanna thank you all for coming. My family and my friends…,105
S07E14 They All Turn Thirty.txt,Joey,Yeah!!,108
S07E14 They All Turn Thirty.txt,Phoebe,I lost a whole year! I can’t believe it! This is so unfair!,110
S07E14 They All Turn Thirty.txt,Joey,"Oh, I don’t know Pheebs. It’ll be okay.",110
S07E14 They All Turn Thirty.txt,Phoebe,"Will it? Will it?! I mean, how would you feel if you found out you were 31?",110
S07E14 They All Turn Thirty.txt,Phoebe,"Plus, it totally ruined my schedule! I…I haven’t done any of the things I wanted to do by the time I was 31!",111
S07E14 They All Turn Thirty.txt,Joey,Like what?,111
S07E14 They All Turn Thirty.txt,Phoebe,"Like okay I-I-I, I haven’t met any Portuguese people! I, I haven’t had the perfect kiss! And I haven’t been to sniper’s school!",111
S07E14 They All Turn Thirty.txt,Monica,"Phoebe, y’know why don’t we just go upstairs and have some birthday cake?",111
S07E14 They All Turn Thirty.txt,Monica,Oh man!,114
S07E14 They All Turn Thirty.txt,Chandler,What?,114
S07E14 They All Turn Thirty.txt,Monica,He’s gonna eat the cake!,114
S07E14 They All Turn Thirty.txt,Phoebe,Oh yeah.,116
S07E14 They All Turn Thirty.txt,Joey,"Oh, and plus I’m 1/16th Portuguese.",117
S07E14 They All Turn Thirty.txt,Ross,"Okay, is everybody clear? We’re gonna pick it up…and move it. Now all we need is teamwork, okay? We’re gonna lift the car…and slide it out. Lift and slide!",119
S07E14 They All Turn Thirty.txt,Rachel,"Ross, I really don’t think…",119
S07E14 They All Turn Thirty.txt,Chandler,"Okay, here we go.",120
S07E14 They All Turn Thirty.txt,Rachel,"Hey Joey, can I…",122
S07E14 They All Turn Thirty.txt,Joey,"Oh, come on Rach! My turn just started!",122
S07E14 They All Turn Thirty.txt,Rachel,"Actually, I just wanna talk to Tag.",122
S07E14 They All Turn Thirty.txt,Joey,"Oh. Okay. Hey, can I ride this outside?",122
S07E14 They All Turn Thirty.txt,Rachel,"Whatever! Okay, I’m not your mother.",122

S01E02 The Sonogram At The End.txt,Chandler,"Yeah, I think for us, kissing is pretty much like an opening act, y'know? I mean it's like the stand-up comedian you have to sit through before Pink Floyd comes out.",2
S01E02 The Sonogram At The End.txt,Ross,"Yeah, and-and it's not that we don't like the comedian, it's that-that... that's not why we bought the ticket.",2

S01E02 The Sonogram At The End.txt,Joey,"Yeah, calm down. You don't see Ross getting all chaotic and twirly every time they come.",14
S01E02 The Sonogram At The End.txt,Monica,"That's because as far as my parents are concerned, Ross can do no wrong. Y'see, he's the Prince. Apparently they had some big ceremony before I was born.",14

S01E02 The Sonogram At The End.txt,Joey,"Alright, when'd'ya have it on last?",18
S01E02 The Sonogram At The End.txt,Phoebe,Doy! Probably right before she lost it!,18

S01E02 The Sonogram At The End.txt,Phoebe,She is so great! I miss her.,25
S01E02 The Sonogram At The End.txt,Monica,What does she mean by 'involved'?,25

S01E02 The Sonogram At The End.txt,Monica,"I know this is going to sound unbelievably selfish, but, were you planning on bringing up the whole baby/lesbian thing? Because I think it might take some of the heat off me.",31
S01E02 The Sonogram At The End.txt,Monica,What's that supposed to mean?,32

S01E02 The Sonogram At The End.txt,Ross,"Well, you may wanna steer clear of the word 'dumped'. Chances are he's gonna be this, this broken shell of a man, y'know, so you should try not to look too terrific, I know it'll be hard. Or, y'know, uh, hey!, I'll go down there, and I'll give Barry back his ring, and you can go with Carol and Susan to the OB/GYN...",45

S04E15 All The Rugby.txt,Ross,"Anyway, she thought the very idea of me playing rugby with him was like hilarious. So I’m gonna show her how tough I really am!",47
S04E15 All The Rugby.txt,Joey,"All right, come on look, Ross can take care of himself! It’s not like he’s…Chandler!",48
S04E15 All The Rugby.txt,All,Oh!,50
S04E15 All The Rugby.txt,Rachel,"Oh, well maybe there was a dog lookin’ at him.",50
S04E15 All The Rugby.txt,Ross,They don’t look any bigger than me!,53
S04E15 All The Rugby.txt,Joey,"Well, maybe that’s because you’re closer to you. So you look bigger to you from where you are.",53
S04E15 All The Rugby.txt,Emily,I’m just going to say hi to the lads. All right?,53
S04E15 All The Rugby.txt,Ross,All right.,53

S04E15 All The Rugby.txt,Monica,Electrical plans for the building.,69
S04E15 All The Rugby.txt,Rachel,"Okay, okay, okay should I be scared?",69

S04E15 All The Rugby.txt,Rachel,Wow! If only more people knew.,69
S04E15 All The Rugby.txt,Chandler,"Y’know you, really didn’t have to take me to the airport.",70
S04E15 All The Rugby.txt,Janice,"Oh please. Every moment is precious. Y’know? Besides, somebody had to ride in that other taxi with the rest of your luggage, and your friends don’t really seem to care too much that you’re leaving.",70

S04E15 All The Rugby.txt,Ross,"No, God no! That is no place for a woman. Those guys will grab anything.",81
S04E15 All The Rugby.txt,Emily,No. That’s not what I’m saying. I just may know a few things that might help you inflict some pain.,81
S04E15 All The Rugby.txt,Ross,I like that.,81
S04E15 All The Rugby.txt,Emily,"Yeah? Listen closely, Devon has got a weak ankle.",81

S04E15 All The Rugby.txt,Ross,"All right, bad ankle, got it!",81
S04E15 All The Rugby.txt,Emily,"And that big bloke with the beard, he has got a trick hip. Yeah. And uh, and David over there, I heard he doesn’t wear a cup.",81
S04E15 All The Rugby.txt,Ross,"Yeah? I can use that, trick hip, no cup, okay! Okay!",81

S04E15 All The Rugby.txt,Rachel,I don’t care! The wires have come loose in your head!,87
S04E15 All The Rugby.txt,Monica,I just thought that if I could follow the wire I could find out what it did.,87
S04E15 All The Rugby.txt,Rachel,And did you?!,87
S04E15 All The Rugby.txt,Monica,"No. It disappears back there behind that baseboard. For a minute there, I thought it went downstairs.",87

S03E10 Rachel Quits.txt,Rachel,"Huh. Well, y'know that’s actually a really good idea, because that way they’ll be closer to the mugs. Y'know what, you should have the other waitresses do that too.",21
S03E10 Rachel Quits.txt,Gunther,They already do. That’s why they call it the ‘tray spot.’,21
S03E10 Rachel Quits.txt,Gunther,It’s all right. Sweetheart.,22

S03E10 Rachel Quits.txt,Ross,"Yeah, Sarah, anything.",25
S03E10 Rachel Quits.txt,Sarah,"Could you pull open the curtains for me? The astronauts from the space shuttle are gonna be on the news, and since we don’t have a TV, the lady across the alley said she’d push hers up to a window, so I could watch it.",25

S03E10 Rachel Quits.txt,Rachel,"Well, I’m also sending out.... good thoughts.",42
S03E10 Rachel Quits.txt,Joey,"If you ask me, as long as you got this job, you’ve got nothing pushing you to get another one. You need the fear.",42

S03E10 Rachel Quits.txt,Chandler,"He’s right, if you quit this job, you then have motivation to go after a job you really want.",42
S03E10 Rachel Quits.txt,Rachel,"Well then how come you’re still at a job that you hate, I mean why don’t you quit and get ‘the fear’?",42
S03E10 Rachel Quits.txt,Chandler,"Because, I’m too afraid.",43

S03E10 Rachel Quits.txt,Rachel,"Okay, fine. Gunther, y'know what, I am a terrible waitress, do you know why I’m a terrible waitress? Because, I don’t care. I don’t care. I don’t care which pot is regular and which pot is decaf, I don’t care where the tray spot is, I just don’t care, this is not what I want to do. So I don’t think I should do it anymore.

That’s when it occurred to me, the key to my success, ‘the munchies.’ So I ah, started hitting the NYU dorms around midnight. I am selling cookies by the case. They call me: 'Cookie Dude!'",48
S03E10 Rachel Quits.txt,Ross,"Well hey, who did these resumes for ya?",49

S10E01 Joey and Rachel Kiss.txt,Phoebe,Shhh... This is the listening side of the wall.,39
S10E01 Joey and Rachel Kiss.txt,Ross,"And then she told me that she and Joey had broken up, and that part of the reason was that she had feelings for me.",40
S10E01 Joey and Rachel Kiss.txt,Ross,And you know I wanted to ask Charlie out since the day I met her.,41
S10E01 Joey and Rachel Kiss.txt,Ross,"Anyway, one thing lead to another, and... oh... before you know it, we were kissing. I mean, how angry do you think Joey is gonna be?",42
S10E01 Joey and Rachel Kiss.txt,Ross,"You know, I gotta go find him. He's gotta be here someplace.",43

S10E01 Joey and Rachel Kiss.txt,Rachel,"Ah, what is this? Well, lets see, we kissed for ten minutes and now we're talking to our friends about it, so I guess this is sixth grade!",46
S10E01 Joey and Rachel Kiss.txt,Phoebe,Oh no... Have you thought about it how complicated this could get? What about Ross?,46
S10E01 Joey and Rachel Kiss.txt,Joey,"Well, he's with Charlie now.",46
S10E01 Joey and Rachel Kiss.txt,Monica,"Yeah, but he wants to talk to you before anything really happens with her. And as his friend, I mean, don't you think he deserves the same from you?",46
S10E01 Joey and Rachel Kiss.txt,Rachel,"All right, look you guys... Look, we appreciate all the advice, but this is between Joey and me and I think we can handle it...",47
S10E01 Joey and Rachel Kiss.txt,Chandler,"Okay, well we'll go back in there, but will you do one thing for us? The people that care about you?",47

S10E01 Joey and Rachel Kiss.txt,Ross,Dude! You're not taking your Bible?,55
S10E01 Joey and Rachel Kiss.txt,Chandler,"You're not supposed to take that. Besides, it's a New Testament, what are you gonna do with it?",55
S10E01 Joey and Rachel Kiss.txt,Ross,Learn about Jesus...,55
S10E01 Joey and Rachel Kiss.txt,Ross,Hey!,56
S10E01 Joey and Rachel Kiss.txt,Charlie,"So, did you talk to Joey?",56

S10E01 Joey and Rachel Kiss.txt,Ross,I thought so.,59
S10E01 Joey and Rachel Kiss.txt,Chandler,What d'ya know... It's a treat for the eyes and the ears.,60
S10E01 Joey and Rachel Kiss.txt,Joey,"Whoo, whoo. Wow, it's uhm... kinda weird that I'm sitting next to Charlie after we broke up.",61
S10E01 Joey and Rachel Kiss.txt,Chandler,"Yeah, it's almost if Air Barbados doesn't care about your social life.",61
S10E01 Joey and Rachel Kiss.txt,Joey,"Look, does someone mind switching to sit with Charlie?",61
S10E01 Joey and Rachel Kiss.txt,Ross,"Oh, I uh, I mean, I... dude, I spent the whole conference with Charlie.",61
S10E01 Joey and Rachel Kiss.txt,Joey,I understand...,61
S10E01 Joey and Rachel Kiss.txt,Chandler,Wish I could switch with someone. I really don't wanna sit with Allen Iverson over there.,62
S10E01 Joey and Rachel Kiss.txt,Phoebe,"Uhm... You know, once we're in the air and the captain turns off the seatbelt sign... you feel free to roam about my cabin...",63

S10E01 Joey and Rachel Kiss.txt,Mike,Three months.,64
S10E01 Joey and Rachel Kiss.txt,Phoebe,"Three months? Okay... This is probably none of my business, but uhm, how long do you think you're gonna keep seeing her?",64
S10E01 Joey and Rachel Kiss.txt,Mike,I'll tell her that it's over tonight at dinner. I promise.,64

S10E01 Joey and Rachel Kiss.txt,Mike,Maybe I'll sign for it. Tear it open. Pull out the packing material...,64
S10E01 Joey and Rachel Kiss.txt,Phoebe,"You know what, we're gonna have sex. Let's just leave it there.",64
S10E01 Joey and Rachel Kiss.txt,Ross,"Right, I'm gonna go talk to Joey. I think this is the right time. He's always in a good mood after the flight attendant says ""duty free"".",65
S10E01 Joey and Rachel Kiss.txt,Charlie,Okay... Good luck.,65
S10E01 Joey and Rachel Kiss.txt,Rachel,Ross is coming over. I think now would be a really good time to talk to him.,66
S10E01 Joey and Rachel Kiss.txt,Joey,I guess so. I'm just... really nervous.,66
S10E01 Joey and Rachel Kiss.txt,Rachel,"Okay, well keep in mind that by the time you're done, they'll probably be serving dinner.",66
S10E01 Joey and Rachel Kiss.txt,Joey,Ooh...,66
S10E01 Joey and Rachel Kiss.txt,Rachel,Still nervous?,66
S10E01 Joey and Rachel Kiss.txt,Joey,I'm gonna get the lasagna.,66
S10E01 Joey and Rachel Kiss.txt,Ross,Hey Rach...,66
S10E01 Joey and Rachel Kiss.txt,Rachel,Yeah!,66
S10E01 Joey and Rachel Kiss.txt,Ross,Do you mind if I sit here for a sec.?,66
S10E01 Joey and Rachel Kiss.txt,Ross,Hey!,67
S10E01 Joey and Rachel Kiss.txt,Joey,Hey!,67
S10E01 Joey and Rachel Kiss.txt,Ross,"So, I uhm... kinda need to talk to you about Charlie.",67
S10E01 Joey and Rachel Kiss.txt,Joey,Yeah?,67
S10E01 Joey and Rachel Kiss.txt,Ross,"Okay, last night after you guys broke up... so sorry to hear about that, by the way... Well, Charlie and I were talking, and..., well...",67

S10E01 Joey and Rachel Kiss.txt,Ross,"Yeah, we kissed, but... nothing else... nothing else happened, okay.",68
S10E01 Joey and Rachel Kiss.txt,Joey,"Ross, Ross, Ross... It's okay.",68
S10E01 Joey and Rachel Kiss.txt,Ross,What?,68
S10E01 Joey and Rachel Kiss.txt,Joey,"It's okay. You know, I totally understand, alright? You guys, make way more sense than her and I ever did, you know. And... I want you to be happy.",68
S10E01 Joey and Rachel Kiss.txt,Ross,Are you serious?,68
S10E01 Joey and Rachel Kiss.txt,Joey,Yeah... Now I have something...,68
S10E01 Joey and Rachel Kiss.txt,Ross,"I am speachless... I mean the fact that you would put my happiness first like that. I mean, you're an incredible friend, you know that?",68
S10E01 Joey and Rachel Kiss.txt,Joey,Oh... uh... look... before you...,68
S10E01 Joey and Rachel Kiss.txt,Ross,"No, I mean it. You are so loyal man, and selfless, and generous...",68
S10E01 Joey and Rachel Kiss.txt,Joey,"I am those things, yeah.",68
S10E01 Joey and Rachel Kiss.txt,Ross,"You know what? I know Chandler longer, so I always think of him as my best friend, but now... I may have to rethink some stuff...",68
S10E01 Joey and Rachel Kiss.txt,Joey,Dude!,68
S10E01 Joey and Rachel Kiss.txt,Ross,"Hey, if there is ever, anything I can do for you...",68
S10E01 Joey and Rachel Kiss.txt,Joey,I can't think of anything.,68
S10E01 Joey and Rachel Kiss.txt,Ross,Thanks!,69

S10E01 Joey and Rachel Kiss.txt,Rachel,"Ah... Well, obviously I think so too.",70
S10E01 Joey and Rachel Kiss.txt,Ross,"Well, I'm so excited about this.",70
S10E01 Joey and Rachel Kiss.txt,Rachel,Really? Excited?,70
S10E01 Joey and Rachel Kiss.txt,Ross,Are you kidding? I have had some very dirty dreams about this...,70
S10E01 Joey and Rachel Kiss.txt,Joey,I couldn't. He was saying all these really nice things about me. I didn't want him to get mad and take 'em all back. I'm on a edge on Chandler.,71
S10E01 Joey and Rachel Kiss.txt,Rachel,"Oh God! Alright, fine. You know what Joey, forget it. When we go back to New York, I will tell him.",71
S10E01 Joey and Rachel Kiss.txt,Joey,"Thank you. Yeah, I appreciate that.",71
S10E01 Joey and Rachel Kiss.txt,Phoebe,"Hi, Mike's place.",73
S10E01 Joey and Rachel Kiss.txt,Mike,"Hey, it's Mike.",73
S10E01 Joey and Rachel Kiss.txt,Phoebe,"Ooh, that was fast.",73
S10E01 Joey and Rachel Kiss.txt,Mike,"Oh, err... no, she's not here yet. You know, I think I'm just gonna take off and break up with her over the phone...",73
S10E01 Joey and Rachel Kiss.txt,Phoebe,"Yeah, you can't do that! Oh, come on Mike, strap on a pair.Why don't you just tell her that we got back together. You know, women appreciate honesty. We also appreciate gentle spanking once in a while. Just F.Y.I.",73
S10E01 Joey and Rachel Kiss.txt,Mike,One more thing... There... might be a picture of Precious on my coffee table.,73
S10E01 Joey and Rachel Kiss.txt,Phoebe,Her name is Precious? Is she a purebreed or did you pick her up at the pound?,73
S10E01 Joey and Rachel Kiss.txt,Mike,"Anyway, I just wanna give you a heads up.",73
S10E01 Joey and Rachel Kiss.txt,Precious,"Hi, I'm Precious, who are you?",75
S10E01 Joey and Rachel Kiss.txt,Precious,"Phoebe? Mike's ex-girlfriend Phoebe, the love of his life? That Phoebe?",76
S10E01 Joey and Rachel Kiss.txt,Chandler,"You go back to work tomorrow night, right?",79
S10E01 Joey and Rachel Kiss.txt,Monica,Yeah!,79
S10E01 Joey and Rachel Kiss.txt,Chandler,"So if you want people to see them, then by definition you're not having them taken out... say, at the break of dawn?",79
S10E01 Joey and Rachel Kiss.txt,Chandler,What are you singing?,80
S10E01 Joey and Rachel Kiss.txt,Monica,"It's ""Bolero"" from ""10"".",80
S10E01 Joey and Rachel Kiss.txt,Chandler,"It's ""Ride of the Valkyries"" from ""Apocalypse Now""... See, here's the thing: The corn rose were really a solution to your frizzy hair problem. And now that we're home, we don't have that problem anymore, so if you think about it... I hate them!",80
S10E01 Joey and Rachel Kiss.txt,Monica,You what? You said you liked them.,80
S10E01 Joey and Rachel Kiss.txt,Chandler,Did I? Let's refresh. I believe what I said was that I could see your scalp.,80
S10E01 Joey and Rachel Kiss.txt,Monica,"Fine, so you don't like them. Everybody else does.",80
S10E01 Joey and Rachel Kiss.txt,Chandler,"Again, let's journey back... As I recall what Rachel said, was she had never notice the shape of your skull before. And Joey... Well, Joey didn't realise that there was anything different.",80
S10E01 Joey and Rachel Kiss.txt,Chandler,Hit yourself in the tooth?,81
S10E01 Joey and Rachel Kiss.txt,Monica,And the eye!,81
S10E01 Joey and Rachel Kiss.txt,Rachel,"That was one time, Ross, and they were only like 5 milligrams.",83
S10E01 Joey and Rachel Kiss.txt,Ross,"Ooh hey, Emma, daddy has some presents for you okay? Okay? I want you to wait right here. Come here sweetie.",83
S10E01 Joey and Rachel Kiss.txt,Rachel,"Aaah... Ross, actually there's something that I really need to talk to you about.",83
S10E01 Joey and Rachel Kiss.txt,Rachel,"Okay, uhm... alright, here's the deal.",84
S10E01 Joey and Rachel Kiss.txt,Rachel,What? What is it?,85
S10E01 Joey and Rachel Kiss.txt,Ross,"Oh, major shampoo explosion!",85
S10E01 Joey and Rachel Kiss.txt,Rachel,"Uh, look Ross, this really isn't easy.",85
S10E01 Joey and Rachel Kiss.txt,Rachel,Because you took three hundred bottles of shampoo?,86
S10E01 Joey and Rachel Kiss.txt,Ross,"I'm sorry, I'm sorry. You were saying?",86
S10E01 Joey and Rachel Kiss.txt,Rachel,"Well, yeah... Okay, look it's about me and...",86
S10E01 Joey and Rachel Kiss.txt,Ross,"Oh, not another one! Oh my G... And this is moisturiser. It's even harder to clean! Why? Why do bad things happen to good people?",86
S10E01 Joey and Rachel Kiss.txt,Rachel,"Wow! Well, clearly this is not a good time.",86
S10E01 Joey and Rachel Kiss.txt,Phoebe,"Okay, bye. Alright, so Mike's on his way over. See, you thought you guys were meeting here, and he thought you were meeting at the restaurant, so you know... Doesn't really matter who's right or wrong. Point is... I'm gonna take off.",88
S10E01 Joey and Rachel Kiss.txt,Precious,"I'm not letting you leave until you tell me what's going on here. I mean, are you guys getting back together or something?",88
S10E01 Joey and Rachel Kiss.txt,Phoebe,"Alright... Susie, can I call you Susie?",88
S10E01 Joey and Rachel Kiss.txt,Precious,My name is Precious.,88
S10E01 Joey and Rachel Kiss.txt,Phoebe,"Yeah, I can't say that. uhm... Susie, I'm gonna be straight with you... Mike and I are back together... and uhm... unfortunately that effectively ends your relationship with him. And he's very sorry about that and wishes you the best of luck in all your endeavours.",88
S10E01 Joey and Rachel Kiss.txt,Precious,I just can't believe this... Why?,88
S10E01 Joey and Rachel Kiss.txt,Phoebe,"Well, I don't...",88
S10E01 Joey and Rachel Kiss.txt,Precious,"Oh, why would he do this? I mean, what's wrong with me?",88
S10E01 Joey and Rachel Kiss.txt,Phoebe,"Nothing, there's nothing wrong with you.",88
S10E01 Joey and Rachel Kiss.txt,Precious,"I mean, what the hell am I supposed to do now?",88
S10E01 Joey and Rachel Kiss.txt,Phoebe,"Damn it woman, pull yourself together! Have some pride, for the love of God.",88
S10E01 Joey and Rachel Kiss.txt,Phoebe,"Okay, not a fan of the tough love.",89
S10E01 Joey and Rachel Kiss.txt,Precious,I just can't believe that Mike didn't give me any warning.,89
S10E01 Joey and Rachel Kiss.txt,Phoebe,"But he didn't really know, you know. He wasn't planning on coming to Barbados and proposing to me...",89
S10E01 Joey and Rachel Kiss.txt,Phoebe,"Look, Precious... Mike's not worth this. You're an attractive, intelligent woman and let's face it, Mike's kind of a wang. I mean, he proposed to me while he was still seeing you... He was gonna break-up with you on your birthday? And, I don't like to kiss-and-tell, but he cheated on you a lot this weekend.",90
S10E01 Joey and Rachel Kiss.txt,Precious,"Oh, my God, maybe you're right. Maybe I don't need him. I deserve to be treated with respect.",90
S10E01 Joey and Rachel Kiss.txt,Precious,"Screw you, Mike. You're a coward and a bastard, and I hope you rot in hell.",91
S10E01 Joey and Rachel Kiss.txt,Phoebe,You're welcome!,92
S10E01 Joey and Rachel Kiss.txt,Chandler,"Honey, you've been in there for a long time... Is everything okay?",93
S10E01 Joey and Rachel Kiss.txt,Monica,Not really.,93
S10E01 Joey and Rachel Kiss.txt,Monica,I have a problem.,94
S10E01 Joey and Rachel Kiss.txt,Chandler,Really? What happened?,94
S10E01 Joey and Rachel Kiss.txt,Monica,"Well, I was dancing around, and singing ""No Woman, No Cry"" and I got stuck.",94
S10E01 Joey and Rachel Kiss.txt,Chandler,You can't move at all?,94
S10E01 Joey and Rachel Kiss.txt,Chandler,"If I untangle you, will you please get rid of the corn rose?",95
S10E01 Joey and Rachel Kiss.txt,Monica,"Yeah, I tried to gnaw myself free.",97
S10E01 Joey and Rachel Kiss.txt,Joey,Hey!,98
S10E01 Joey and Rachel Kiss.txt,Rachel,Hi!,98
S10E01 Joey and Rachel Kiss.txt,Joey,"So, did you err... did you tell Ross?",98
S10E01 Joey and Rachel Kiss.txt,Rachel,"Well, I tried, but then he had a shampoo related emergency. So I guess now it's your turn again.",98
S10E01 Joey and Rachel Kiss.txt,Rachel,"Yeah, 'cause that's what we do.",99
S10E01 Joey and Rachel Kiss.txt,Joey,"Alright, alright, okay, uhm... How 'bout this, how about this? Tomorrow... tomorrow we'll both go and we'll tell him together.",99
S10E01 Joey and Rachel Kiss.txt,Rachel,"Okay, that sounds fair. It just means that once again we can't...",99
S10E01 Joey and Rachel Kiss.txt,Joey,"I know, I know..., but that's okay. I mean, we can control ourselves, we're not animals.",99
S10E01 Joey and Rachel Kiss.txt,Rachel,"No! Of course we can wait. Alright, so I guess that means good night then?",99
S10E01 Joey and Rachel Kiss.txt,Rachel,Goo--ood night!,100
S10E01 Joey and Rachel Kiss.txt,Rachel,"Seriously, good night!",101
S10E01 Joey and Rachel Kiss.txt,Joey,Stop saying good night.,101
S10E01 Joey and Rachel Kiss.txt,Rachel,Okay.,101
S10E01 Joey and Rachel Kiss.txt,Chandler,"Now that I untangled you, how 'bout you doing a little something for me?",104
S10E01 Joey and Rachel Kiss.txt,Monica,"Sure, what do you have in mind?",104
S10E01 Joey and Rachel Kiss.txt,Chandler,I think you know.,104
S10E01 Joey and Rachel Kiss.txt,Monica,Really? I don't really feel like it.,104
S10E01 Joey and Rachel Kiss.txt,Chandler,This is what I want to do.,104
S10E01 Joey and Rachel Kiss.txt,Monica,"Okay, I just don't get why you like it so much.",104
S02E24 Barry And Mindys Wedding.txt,Rachel,"Hey Joey, how'd the audition go?",2

S02E24 Barry And Mindys Wedding.txt,Joey,"I did do it, I'm a professional.",3
S02E24 Barry And Mindys Wedding.txt,Monica,Then what's the problem?,3
S02E24 Barry And Mindys Wedding.txt,Joey,"See after the scene, Mr. Beatty comes up to me and says 'good actor, bad kisser'. Can you believe that, me not a good kisser, that's like, like Mother Theresa, not a good mother.",3
S02E24 Barry And Mindys Wedding.txt,Chandler,"Hey, what did your agent say?",5
S02E24 Barry And Mindys Wedding.txt,Joey,"Yep, this kiss thing is defiantly a problem, Mr. Beatty wants to see it again on Monday. Man, I gotta figure out what I'm doing wrong. Oh, okay, one of you girls come over here and kiss me.",5
S02E24 Barry And Mindys Wedding.txt,Monica,"What, forget it!",5

S08E10 Monicas Boots.txt,Rachel,"No, forget it! No way! I am not sending anymore Ralph Lauren clothes to prison. It is a waste.",10
S08E10 Monicas Boots.txt,Joey,"No-no-no-no-no-no, not her, not her. My youngest sister, Dina, she’s really interested in fashion, and she wants to talk to someone successful, y’know, to give her some advice.",10
S08E10 Monicas Boots.txt,Rachel,I guess I can talk to one of my supervisors…,10

S08E10 Monicas Boots.txt,Ross,Yeah I know; he’s in Ben’s class.,11
S08E10 Monicas Boots.txt,Phoebe,You knew this and you never said anything?! With all the stupid dinosaur stuff you tell us?!,11

S08E10 Monicas Boots.txt,Ross,What are you reading? The Kidnappers Guide to Manhattan Private Schools?,12
S08E10 Monicas Boots.txt,Phoebe,"No, it’s New York magazine. It’s an article about the best schools in the city. So how well do you know Sting?",12
S08E10 Monicas Boots.txt,Ross,"Uh, I actually haven’t even met him.",12
S08E10 Monicas Boots.txt,Phoebe,"Uh-huh, yeah that’s too bad. I really want to go to his concert Friday night, but it’s totally sold out. I know! Why don’t you meet him and get tickets?! If you get two I’ll take you.",12
S08E10 Monicas Boots.txt,Ross,"Well actually, I’m picking Ben up tomorrow, maybe he’ll be there.",12
S08E10 Monicas Boots.txt,Phoebe,"There you go! Oh, you are so lucky! You might actually get to meet Sting tomorrow! That’s why you have kids!",12
S08E10 Monicas Boots.txt,Monica,Hey guys!,13
S08E10 Monicas Boots.txt,Chandler,Hey-hey.,13
S08E10 Monicas Boots.txt,Rachel,Hi Monica!,13
S08E10 Monicas Boots.txt,Rachel,Hi boots.,14

S08E10 Monicas Boots.txt,Phoebe,Wow! They’re beautiful!,15
S08E10 Monicas Boots.txt,Rachel,Ahh…,15
S08E10 Monicas Boots.txt,Phoebe,What?!,16
S08E10 Monicas Boots.txt,Monica,The guy who made these hates feet and wants to see them die!,16
S08E10 Monicas Boots.txt,Rachel,Well-well you can give them to me! I haven’t felt my feet in years!,16
S08E10 Monicas Boots.txt,Monica,"I can’t! I spent so much money on them and I told Chandler that I’d wear them all the time, I just can’t give them away!",16
S08E10 Monicas Boots.txt,Phoebe,Well then get your money back and return them!,16
S08E10 Monicas Boots.txt,Monica,I can’t do that either! The soles’ are already a little scuffed up and the insides are filled with my blood.,16
S08E10 Monicas Boots.txt,Ross,Hey I uh just picked up Ben from school…,18
S08E10 Monicas Boots.txt,Phoebe,Oh no! Why not?,20
S08E10 Monicas Boots.txt,Ross,Well it turns out that Ben and Sting’s son do not get along.,20
S08E10 Monicas Boots.txt,Phoebe,How come?!,20
S08E10 Monicas Boots.txt,Ross,"Apparently, Sting’s son made fun of the fact that Ben’s moms are lesbinims.",20
S08E10 Monicas Boots.txt,Phoebe,Wait! But Ross if they don’t get along then you should smooth things over. Make them be friends.,20
S08E10 Monicas Boots.txt,Ross,"Phoebe, you can’t force kids to be friends.",20
S08E10 Monicas Boots.txt,Phoebe,"Sure you can! Give them some blocks, put them in a playpen!",20
S08E10 Monicas Boots.txt,Ross,Playpen?! Ben’s seven!,20
S08E10 Monicas Boots.txt,Ross,"Look I’m sorry Pheebs, I can’t do it.",21
S08E10 Monicas Boots.txt,Phoebe,Yes you can! Sting says so himself!,21
S08E10 Monicas Boots.txt,Ross,What?,21
S08E10 Monicas Boots.txt,Ross,"Look Phoebe, I’m sorry it’s just…",22
S08E10 Monicas Boots.txt,Ross,"Phoebe, I…",23
S08E10 Monicas Boots.txt,Rachel,"Oh Joey, I’m hardly a…",27
S08E10 Monicas Boots.txt,Joey,My little sister Dina!,27
S08E10 Monicas Boots.txt,Rachel,Right! Hi Dina!,27
S08E10 Monicas Boots.txt,Dina,Hi.,27
S08E10 Monicas Boots.txt,Dina,Thanks so much for meetin’ with me. Joey’s told me so much about you!,28
S08E10 Monicas Boots.txt,Rachel,"Okay. All right Dina, well let’s talk about the different areas of fashion that you could get involved in. Let’s see, there’s design, but you may need a whole other degree for that. Uh, there’s-there’s sales, which is great because you get to travel…",29
S08E10 Monicas Boots.txt,Dina,"I…I don’t care about fashion! I’m pregnant! And I know you are too, so you gotta help me!",29
S08E10 Monicas Boots.txt,Monica,"Honey, we don’t really have to go to this thing tonight do we?",35
S08E10 Monicas Boots.txt,Chandler,"Now sweetie, I know you don’t like my office parties, but you can wear your new boots. See? Every cloud has a…supple leather lining.",35
S08E10 Monicas Boots.txt,Monica,I-I don’t-I don’t think that I’m gonna wear the boots tonight.,35
S08E10 Monicas Boots.txt,Chandler,Why not?,35
S08E10 Monicas Boots.txt,Monica,"Well y’know, I’m just-I’m just worried that bosses will see them and think they pay you too much money. Or! Or your assistant will see them and-and want a raise!",35
S08E10 Monicas Boots.txt,Chandler,Do you think I work at some kind of boot pricing company?,35
S08E10 Monicas Boots.txt,Monica,"Anyway, I picked up this outfit that I want to wear and the, and the boots don’t really go with it.",35
S08E10 Monicas Boots.txt,Chandler,"You said that you paid all that money because those boots go with skirts, dresses, and pants!",35
S08E10 Monicas Boots.txt,Monica,"Fine! If you want me to wear the boots, I’ll wear the boots. In fact, I’ll go into my room right now and y’know try the outfit on.",35
S08E10 Monicas Boots.txt,Chandler,Okay.,35
S08E10 Monicas Boots.txt,Dina,I-I can’t go in there. I can’t tell him!,37
S08E10 Monicas Boots.txt,Dina,Thank you.,38
S08E10 Monicas Boots.txt,Rachel,Okay.,38
S08E10 Monicas Boots.txt,Rachel,"Honey, why don’t you sit down? Dina has something that she wants to tell you.",40
S08E10 Monicas Boots.txt,Dina,"Joe, mom and dad are fine…",41
S08E10 Monicas Boots.txt,Joey,Is that a sandwich?!,41
S08E10 Monicas Boots.txt,Rachel,Joey…there’s something that you…should know. Dina?,41
S08E10 Monicas Boots.txt,Dina,I’m pregnant.,41
S08E10 Monicas Boots.txt,Joey,Well obviously this is a mistake! You can’t be pregnant! Because you have to have sex to get pregnant!,43
S08E10 Monicas Boots.txt,Dina,"Joe, I tried to wait until I was 25 like you did!",43
S08E10 Monicas Boots.txt,Rachel,What?! Dina…,43
S08E10 Monicas Boots.txt,Dina,"Bobby Corso, but he’s a real nice guy. I like him a lot. He’s real funny.",44
S08E10 Monicas Boots.txt,Joey,"You got pregnant for funny?! Dina…if he’s funny…laugh! All right, I’ll be back in a little while! You stay here!",44
S08E10 Monicas Boots.txt,Dina,Why? Where are you going?,44
S08E10 Monicas Boots.txt,Dina,Wow.,45
S08E10 Monicas Boots.txt,Rachel,I know.,45
S08E10 Monicas Boots.txt,Phoebe,"Oh, there you are Ben!",47
S08E10 Monicas Boots.txt,Ben,"Aunt Phoebe, what are you doing here?",47
S08E10 Monicas Boots.txt,Phoebe,"Well, I heard you’re having a problem with one of the boys in your class. And so I thought I would just come down here and sit you both down, have a little talk and make it all okay. Now umm, the boy’s name is Sting’s son.",47
S08E10 Monicas Boots.txt,Ben,Jack? I hate him! He’s a jerk.,47
S08E10 Monicas Boots.txt,Phoebe,"Now Ben, sometimes people may seem like jerks on the outside, but they have famous fathers.",47
S08E10 Monicas Boots.txt,Phoebe,"Yes! Yes you can, I’m looking for Jack’s parents.",49
S08E10 Monicas Boots.txt,Phoebe,"Uh-huh, I’m with Ben.",49
S08E10 Monicas Boots.txt,Phoebe,"I am one of Ben’s mothers. I’m a lesbian. It was, it was difficult coming out to my parents.",49
S08E10 Monicas Boots.txt,Phoebe,Oh.,49
S08E10 Monicas Boots.txt,Phoebe,Ah! Okay so that would make me Susan.,49
S08E10 Monicas Boots.txt,Phoebe,"Yeah! Let’s do that!! That-that sounds good. We should sit down and talk, just me, my lover Carol, and the Stings. Umm, how-how will I get in touch with them?",50
S08E10 Monicas Boots.txt,Phoebe,"Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Umm, could-could I get a copy of that? ‘Cause Carol threw it out, she lost ours. She’s such a scatterbrain, but man what a hot piece of ass.",50
S08E10 Monicas Boots.txt,Chandler,"Y’know, that party wasn’t bad.",51
S08E10 Monicas Boots.txt,Monica,Yeah! I didn’t know there would be dancing. That was a fun surprise!,51
S08E10 Monicas Boots.txt,Chandler,"I don’t see any uh, cabs. Maybe we should just walk?",51
S08E10 Monicas Boots.txt,Monica,"Oh no, we can’t walk!",51
S08E10 Monicas Boots.txt,Chandler,"What honey, it’s like fifteen blocks to the subway. Let’s go.",51
S08E10 Monicas Boots.txt,Monica,Hey! Do you think that we can get to the subway right there if we climb down through the manhole cover?,51
S08E10 Monicas Boots.txt,Chandler,What’s going on?,51
S08E10 Monicas Boots.txt,Monica,I can’t walk. Okay? Okay? These boots were a huge mistake!,51
S08E10 Monicas Boots.txt,Chandler,What?,51
S08E10 Monicas Boots.txt,Monica,"Okay you were right! All right, I never should have bought them! They’re killing me! One toe at a time!",51
S08E10 Monicas Boots.txt,Monica,How are we gonna get home? Maybe a piggy-back ride?,52
S08E10 Monicas Boots.txt,Chandler,Hop on.,52
S08E10 Monicas Boots.txt,Chandler,"Honey, I know you’re in pain right now, but I’m a little turned on.",53
S08E10 Monicas Boots.txt,Dina,Do you ever worry that you’ll be walking and your baby will just like slip out?,54
S08E10 Monicas Boots.txt,Rachel,What college was that Dina?,54
S08E10 Monicas Boots.txt,Dina,Oh my God! Bobby!,55
S08E10 Monicas Boots.txt,Bobby,Hi Dina. Good to see you.,55
S08E10 Monicas Boots.txt,Rachel,"Joey, what are you doing?",55
S08E10 Monicas Boots.txt,Joey,"Just what needs to be done! Dearly beloved, we are gathered here to join this man and this woman…",55
S08E10 Monicas Boots.txt,Rachel,Oh Joey this is crazy!,55
S08E10 Monicas Boots.txt,Joey,"Don’t interrupt me when I’m talkin’ to God! Now where were we? Oh right, okay. Do you Dina, take this man…",55
S08E10 Monicas Boots.txt,Dina,No!,55
S08E10 Monicas Boots.txt,Joey,Oh you’ll take ‘em!,55
S08E10 Monicas Boots.txt,Dina,No I won’t!,55
S08E10 Monicas Boots.txt,Joey,Hey! You don’t get a say in this!,55
S08E10 Monicas Boots.txt,Dina,Yes I do!,55
S08E10 Monicas Boots.txt,Bobby,"Yeah, he took the other one off and hit me with it.",57
S08E10 Monicas Boots.txt,Joey,Well what am I supposed to do?,57
S08E10 Monicas Boots.txt,Rachel,You’re supposed to realize that they are adults! And that they can make their own decisions.,57
S08E10 Monicas Boots.txt,Joey,No they can’t! They were stupid enough to get knocked up!,57
S08E10 Monicas Boots.txt,Bobby,Yeah…we kinda didn’t use any…,58
S08E10 Monicas Boots.txt,Rachel,"Oh, come on kids! A little help here!",58
S08E10 Monicas Boots.txt,Phoebe,Hi!,61
S08E10 Monicas Boots.txt,Phoebe,Uh-huh.,61
S08E10 Monicas Boots.txt,Phoebe,Why else would I be here?,61
S08E10 Monicas Boots.txt,Phoebe,Yeah.,62
S08E10 Monicas Boots.txt,Phoebe,"Umm, I’m sorry. Won’t-won’t Jack’s father be joining us?",62
S08E10 Monicas Boots.txt,Phoebe,"Uh-hmm. Okay. Well then, could we reschedule? For say, Friday night perhaps at 8 o’clock?",62
S08E10 Monicas Boots.txt,Phoebe,"Concert. Yeah. That does put us in…quite a pickle. Because you see I’m very busy before and after the concert, and he’s obviously busy during.",62
S08E10 Monicas Boots.txt,Phoebe,"Unless! Unless umm, okay I-I would be willing to go to the concert, umm, all the while thinking about the children of course.",62
S08E10 Monicas Boots.txt,Phoebe,"Oh, thank you. Four would be great.",62
S08E10 Monicas Boots.txt,Phoebe,Oh good! Then you’re in luck! Ben’s not my son!,62
S08E10 Monicas Boots.txt,Chandler,"Okay, ten blocks down. Five to go.",65
S08E10 Monicas Boots.txt,Chandler,Oh I’m sorry! Do you need a break?,66
S08E10 Monicas Boots.txt,Monica,My boots in tan! Hey! Can you get a little closer so I can see the price?,66
S08E10 Monicas Boots.txt,Chandler,I can see it from right here. It’ll cost you one husband.,66
S08E10 Monicas Boots.txt,Monica,"Okay, I’m sorry. I think I can walk the rest of the way now. Just-just give me my boots.",66
S08E10 Monicas Boots.txt,Monica,Well I don’t have them either. Where are they?,67
S08E10 Monicas Boots.txt,Chandler,"Well, why don’t you check in one of my saddlebags while I chew on a bale of hay!",67
S08E10 Monicas Boots.txt,Chandler,"Honey, are you seriously ever gonna wear the boots again?",68
S08E10 Monicas Boots.txt,Monica,"Okay, I’m never gonna wear them again. I just didn’t get a chance to say goodbye.",68
S08E10 Monicas Boots.txt,Chandler,Y’know what? You can say goodbye to the tan ones.,68
S08E10 Monicas Boots.txt,Rachel,"Joey, just because they’re not getting married doesn’t mean this is going to be a disaster. Maybe they have a plan!",72
S08E10 Monicas Boots.txt,Joey,"Oh? Oh! Okay! Okay! Let’s hear their plan! Now, what’s the future look like for Dina and Bobby?",72
S08E10 Monicas Boots.txt,Bobby,Well…I really have high hopes for my band.,72
S08E10 Monicas Boots.txt,Rachel,"Hey, now wait a minute! I get when you told people at first that you wanted to be an actor they laughed at you! Now come on Bobby, why don’t you tell us a little bit about your band?",73
S08E10 Monicas Boots.txt,Bobby,"Well it’s just me and my pal Rooster, the band’s name is Numb Nuts.",73
S08E10 Monicas Boots.txt,Dina,No Joey! I knew you wouldn’t be supportive!,75
S08E10 Monicas Boots.txt,Joey,So whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa! What are you gonna do? You’re gonna have the baby and-and raise it by yourself…without a husband?! You can’t be a single mother alone! You’re gonna ruin your life!,75
S08E10 Monicas Boots.txt,Rachel,Oh excuse me! Am I ruining my life?,75

S03E04 The Metaphorical Tunnel.txt,Chandler,"I am, I actually am. I mean this is amazing. My entire life I have feared this place, and now that I'm here it's like what was the big deal. I could probably say 'Let's move in together.' and I'd be okay.",41
S03E04 The Metaphorical Tunnel.txt,Janice,You probably want us to move in together?,41
S03E04 The Metaphorical Tunnel.txt,Chandler,It doesn't scare me!,41

S06E18 Ross Dates A Student.txt,Chandler,"Honey, it is not a date! I haven’t talked to her in ten years! You can’t just call up somebody you haven’t talked to in ten years and ask them for a favor. There are rules, y’know? You gotta, you got to put in some time.",37

S06E18 Ross Dates A Student.txt,Monica,"I know! Now look, there’s only one problem though. There’s only room for one, so I guess one of you will have to stay at Joey’s.",43
S06E18 Ross Dates A Student.txt,Rachel,"Hey! Hey-hey, now this was no one’s fault Pheebs. Okay? It was an accident.",44
S06E18 Ross Dates A Student.txt,Phoebe,"Well no, it was my fault so you should get the nice room.",44

S06E18 Ross Dates A Student.txt,Ross,"Well, not really. I mean technically it’s-it’s not against the rules or anything, but it is frowned upon. Especially by that professor we ran into last night, Judgey von Holierthanthou.",63
S06E18 Ross Dates A Student.txt,Monica,"Well Ross, you be careful now. You don’t want to get a reputation as y’know Professor McNailshisstudents.",63
S06E18 Ross Dates A Student.txt,Ross,Yeah. What-what should I do?,63

S06E18 Ross Dates A Student.txt,Rachel,"Oh, Joey! Sorry!",77
S06E18 Ross Dates A Student.txt,Joey,No that’s all right. Don’t worry about it.,77

S06E18 Ross Dates A Student.txt,Phoebe,Yeah she said something about crumbies.,91
S06E18 Ross Dates A Student.txt,Joey,"That’s right, all the ladies want to stay at Joey’s.",93
S06E18 Ross Dates A Student.txt,Rachel,"No! No! Phoebe, come on! I don’t want to switch! Please come on! I can throw wet paper towels here!",93
S06E18 Ross Dates A Student.txt,Phoebe,No but at Monica’s you can eat cookies over the sink!,93
S06E18 Ross Dates A Student.txt,Rachel,I know. I’m sorry.,93
S06E18 Ross Dates A Student.txt,Joey,Yeah.,94
S06E18 Ross Dates A Student.txt,Ross,Wow! It actually is in the handbook. I can’t date you or have a hot plate in my office. I can’t believe we have to stop seeing each other.,96

S06E18 Ross Dates A Student.txt,Ross,"I know, I know I really like you too. But we-we can’t date. It’s against the rules. It’s forbidden.",96
S06E18 Ross Dates A Student.txt,Elizabeth,Wow!,96

S06E05 Joeys Porsche.txt,Ross,"Okay, maybe it wasn’t my best decision. But I just couldn’t face another failed marriage.",4
S06E05 Joeys Porsche.txt,Chandler,"Okay, let me just jump in and ask, at what point did you think this was a successful marriage?",4
S06E05 Joeys Porsche.txt,Phoebe,"Okay, this is inexcusable. I am shocked to my very core!",5
S06E05 Joeys Porsche.txt,Ross,"Phoebe, I told her you already knew.",5

S06E05 Joeys Porsche.txt,Ross,"Okay Rach, but…",24

S06E05 Joeys Porsche.txt,Phoebe,"Na-uh, no, we are all responsible for our own babies.",29
S06E05 Joeys Porsche.txt,Chandler,See that’s where I think that you’re wrong. We’ve been playing these babies man for man; we should really be playing a zone defense.,29
S06E05 Joeys Porsche.txt,Monica,What do you mean?,29
S06E05 Joeys Porsche.txt,Phoebe,"That sounds really great, but maybe you should be in charge of wiping.",30
S06E05 Joeys Porsche.txt,Chandler,"Okay, I’m a rookie. I should not be in the end zone.",30
S06E05 Joeys Porsche.txt,Monica,This is so great! This is exactly how we set the plates at the restaurant.,31
S06E05 Joeys Porsche.txt,Chandler,Hey!,33
S06E05 Joeys Porsche.txt,Phoebe,Hey!,33

S06E05 Joeys Porsche.txt,Chandler,Shocking! Since you still have the keys.,33
S06E05 Joeys Porsche.txt,Joey,"You should see the treatment I get when I’m with that car! People are friendly; they-they wanna talk, and not just about the car! One guy gave me advice about my equity investments.",33
S06E05 Joeys Porsche.txt,Chandler,What equity investments?,33
S06E05 Joeys Porsche.txt,Monica,"Oh yeah, I got soap and sponges and rags and Carnuba wax and polishing compound.",34
S06E05 Joeys Porsche.txt,Chandler,You don’t even have a car!,34
S06E05 Joeys Porsche.txt,Monica,"I know. But umm, one time there was this really dirty car in front of the building, so I washed it.",34

S06E05 Joeys Porsche.txt,Joey,"Yeah, she tops out at 130.",35

S06E05 Joeys Porsche.txt,Joey,"Okay, take it easy.",35
S06E05 Joeys Porsche.txt,Joey,"Really? Oh uh, oh just give me five more minutes with it.",35

S06E05 Joeys Porsche.txt,Joey,"Yeah, so did I.",36
S06E05 Joeys Porsche.txt,Phoebe,I don’t know why I was so nervous about this. And I don’t know why Frank and Alice are always complaining. This is so easy.,38
S06E05 Joeys Porsche.txt,Monica,"Yeah, two hours, a lifetime that’s the same.",38
S06E05 Joeys Porsche.txt,Monica,"Chandler, what are you doing? That thing can put someone’s eye out!",39
S06E05 Joeys Porsche.txt,Chandler,He can do more than that! He can destroy the universe!,39
S06E05 Joeys Porsche.txt,Phoebe,"No Chandler, they can swallow one of those little parts! And also, look at his smooth area, that’s just gonna mess them up.",39
S06E05 Joeys Porsche.txt,Chandler,"They’re not gonna swallow anything, you guys are being way over protective. When I was a kid, my mom used to just throw me into a pile of broken glass!",39
S06E05 Joeys Porsche.txt,Phoebe,What?!,39
S06E05 Joeys Porsche.txt,Phoebe,"Oh, look at little Leslie stretching in her sleep.",40

S06E05 Joeys Porsche.txt,Phoebe,"Oh, I can still do that.",40
S06E05 Joeys Porsche.txt,Monica,How are you still single?!,40

S06E05 Joeys Porsche.txt,Chandler,I swallowed the sonic blaster gun.,41
S06E05 Joeys Porsche.txt,Phoebe,How did that happen?!!,41
S06E05 Joeys Porsche.txt,Judge,Okay you two are asking the court for an annulment?,44
S06E05 Joeys Porsche.txt,Rachel,"Yes your honor, and here are, are forms, all filled out.",44
S06E05 Joeys Porsche.txt,Judge,So based on your petition you are seeking an annulment on the grounds that Mr. Geller is mentally unstable.,44
S06E05 Joeys Porsche.txt,Ross,"Fine, I’m mentally unstable.",44
S06E05 Joeys Porsche.txt,Judge,And based on the fact that Mr. Geller is intravenous drug user.,44
S06E05 Joeys Porsche.txt,Ross,What?!,44
S06E05 Joeys Porsche.txt,Rachel,"Uh yes, heroin and crack.",44
S06E05 Joeys Porsche.txt,Ross,Crack isn’t even an intravenous drug!,44
S06E05 Joeys Porsche.txt,Rachel,"Well, you would know.",44
S06E05 Joeys Porsche.txt,Judge,Now it also says here that you lied about your sexual preference before marriage?,44
S06E05 Joeys Porsche.txt,Ross,"Oh, come on!",44
S06E05 Joeys Porsche.txt,Judge,"And finally that you were unable to consummate the marriage. Well, that makes sense since you’re gay and addicted to heroin.",45
S06E05 Joeys Porsche.txt,Ross,"Okay, I’m sorry, this is insane! I-I-I’m not addicted to heroin, I’m not gay, and there is no problem with my ability to consummate anything! Look, I’ll consummate this marriage right here, right now!",45
S06E05 Joeys Porsche.txt,Judge,That won’t be necessary.,45
S06E05 Joeys Porsche.txt,Ross,And when we were dating we consummated like bunnies!,45
S06E05 Joeys Porsche.txt,Rachel,Ugh!,45
S06E05 Joeys Porsche.txt,Judge,"Now if you were two involved in a serious relationship, that really creates a problem.",45
S06E05 Joeys Porsche.txt,Judge,"Is there, anything in this record that is actually true?",46
S06E05 Joeys Porsche.txt,Rachel,"Well, yes, we got married in Vegas and uh, and the names I think.",46
S06E05 Joeys Porsche.txt,Judge,"Well, based on what I heard, you two certainly don’t qualify for an annulment. If you two don’t want to be together you’ll have to file for divorce.",46
S06E05 Joeys Porsche.txt,Judge,You need to get out of my chambers.,50
S06E05 Joeys Porsche.txt,Rachel,"All right look lady here is the deal, I came here for an annulment and I am not leaving here until I get one!",50
S06E05 Joeys Porsche.txt,Ross,Yeah!,50
S06E05 Joeys Porsche.txt,Judge,Would you like to spend the night in jail?,50
S06E05 Joeys Porsche.txt,Chandler,But you found the keys to his clothes?,53
S06E05 Joeys Porsche.txt,Joey,"No. No, I just uh, I just loved the way it feels when everybody thinks I own a Porsche.",53
S06E05 Joeys Porsche.txt,Monica,And people will think you own a Porsche because you’re wearing the clothes?,53
S06E05 Joeys Porsche.txt,Joey,Of course! Only an idiot would wear this stuff if you didn’t have the car! Right?,53
S06E05 Joeys Porsche.txt,Chandler,That is true.,53
S06E05 Joeys Porsche.txt,Phoebe,"Yeah, but only a genius would swallow a sonic blaster gun.",53
S06E05 Joeys Porsche.txt,Monica,"Joey, you know you don’t actually have one.",54
S06E05 Joeys Porsche.txt,Chandler,"Ahh, I think it just moved. It’s really poking me.",55
S06E05 Joeys Porsche.txt,Monica,"All right, that’s it, we’re going to the emergency room.",55
S06E05 Joeys Porsche.txt,Phoebe,"What?! No, you can’t, you can’t leave me here with them! We’re baby-sitting!",55
S06E05 Joeys Porsche.txt,Monica,"The babies are asleep, I’m sure you’ll be okay on your own for a while!",55
S06E05 Joeys Porsche.txt,Phoebe,But you-you can’t leave me with them! We-we’re a team! We’re playing a zone! They’re gonna triple team me!,55
S06E05 Joeys Porsche.txt,Monica,"He’s got something plastic lodged in his throat, we’ve got to go to the hospital.",55
S06E05 Joeys Porsche.txt,Phoebe,"But no, because a doctor won’t be able to help him, it’s just gonna y’know naturally pass through his system in like seven years.",55
S06E05 Joeys Porsche.txt,Chandler,I think that’s gum.,55
S06E05 Joeys Porsche.txt,Phoebe,I’m pretty sure it’s gun.,55
S06E05 Joeys Porsche.txt,Chandler,"Okay, listen this really hurts. Let’s go.",55
S06E05 Joeys Porsche.txt,Joey,Why isn’t that valet back with my Porsche?,57
S06E05 Joeys Porsche.txt,Passerby,Maybe because you’ve got the keys?,57
S06E05 Joeys Porsche.txt,Rachel,This is totally your fault!,59
S06E05 Joeys Porsche.txt,Ross,My fault?! You threatened the judge!,59
S06E05 Joeys Porsche.txt,Rachel,"Well, you ripped the paper out of the court reporter’s machine!!",59
S06E05 Joeys Porsche.txt,Ross,That was the only way I could get him to stop typing!,59
S06E05 Joeys Porsche.txt,Joey,Hi! How are the Gellers?,59
S06E05 Joeys Porsche.txt,Chandler,"Well, let’s just say that Krog will be fully equipped to destroy the universe again in twelve to fourteen hours.",67
S06E05 Joeys Porsche.txt,Phoebe,"Okay, so I totally took care of the babies all by myself! I fed ‘em, bathed ‘em, and put ‘em to bed.",67
S06E05 Joeys Porsche.txt,Chandler,And protected them from a tornado?,67
S06E05 Joeys Porsche.txt,Monica,Oh my God.,68
S06E05 Joeys Porsche.txt,Phoebe,"I know, the babies are asleep.",68
S06E05 Joeys Porsche.txt,Monica,"Phoebe, what, what happened here?!",68
S06E05 Joeys Porsche.txt,Phoebe,I did it! I took care of the babies all by myself!,68
S06E05 Joeys Porsche.txt,Monica,But my apartment!,68
S06E05 Joeys Porsche.txt,Chandler,Was the setting of Phoebe’s triumph.,68
S06E05 Joeys Porsche.txt,Monica,But the mess!,68
S06E05 Joeys Porsche.txt,Chandler,Is not as important as the fact that Phoebe took care of the babies all by herself.,68
S06E05 Joeys Porsche.txt,Monica,"You’re right, you’re right I shouldn’t freak out. ‘Cause this is what will happen when you and I have babies! When will that be?!",68
S06E05 Joeys Porsche.txt,Ross,"I picked up the divorce papers. Uh, I’ve already signed everything and I put little ‘X’s where you need to sign.",71
S06E05 Joeys Porsche.txt,Rachel,"Oh, little ‘X’s! Great! That makes up for everything!",71
S06E05 Joeys Porsche.txt,Ross,"Y’know, I-I—you’ve done a lot of stupid stuff too! Okay?",71
S06E05 Joeys Porsche.txt,Rachel,"Oh, name one stupid thing that is as stupid as this one!",71
S06E05 Joeys Porsche.txt,Ross,"Okay, how about you flew to London to stop my wedding! Ah, how about you told me you loved me after I was already married!",71
S06E05 Joeys Porsche.txt,Rachel,Hey! Wait a minute! That was different! I did those things because I was in love with you!,71
S06E05 Joeys Porsche.txt,Ross,Yeah! Right!,71
S06E05 Joeys Porsche.txt,Ross,"Okay, can we just sign please?",74
S06E05 Joeys Porsche.txt,Rachel,"Okay Ross, we’re—wait a minute. Umm, I uh, I kinda have a little confession.",76
S06E05 Joeys Porsche.txt,Ross,What?,76
S06E05 Joeys Porsche.txt,Rachel,"Well, y’know this whole marriage thing, kinda my idea.",76
S06E05 Joeys Porsche.txt,Ross,Excuse me?,76
S06E05 Joeys Porsche.txt,Rachel,"Well, remember how we were too drunk to remember anything the night we were married?",76
S06E05 Joeys Porsche.txt,Ross,Yeah?,76
S06E05 Joeys Porsche.txt,Rachel,"Yeah, don’t push it though.",78
S06E05 Joeys Porsche.txt,Ross,"I’ve got to say; I know I divorce a lot of women, never thought I would be divorcing you.",78
S06E05 Joeys Porsche.txt,Ross,"Did I, did I even treat?",79
S06E05 Joeys Porsche.txt,Rachel,"No, it was on the house, it was, it was a newlywed special.",79
S06E05 Joeys Porsche.txt,Ross,That may be the most depressing thing I’ve heard in my life. I should probably get these to my lawyer’s office.,79
S06E05 Joeys Porsche.txt,Rachel,"Hey, thanks Ross, for taking care of all of this.",79
S06E05 Joeys Porsche.txt,Ross,"Eh, no problem.",79
S06E05 Joeys Porsche.txt,Rachel,I’m gonna need a copy of those.,80
S06E05 Joeys Porsche.txt,Joey,Hey! Hey! Be careful around my Porsche!,82
S06E05 Joeys Porsche.txt,Joey,Hey! How you doin’?,83
S07E11 All The Cheesecakes.txt,Chandler,Ohh. Mmm.,2
S07E11 All The Cheesecakes.txt,Chandler,"Hey, you have got to try this cheesecake.",3
S07E11 All The Cheesecakes.txt,Chandler,I—no! I didn't read the box before I opened it. And you can't return a box after you've opened the box.,6
S07E11 All The Cheesecakes.txt,Rachel,"Why, why not?",6
S07E11 All The Cheesecakes.txt,Chandler,Because it's too delicious.,6
S07E11 All The Cheesecakes.txt,Rachel,"Chandler, you stole this cheesecake. That is wrong.",6
S07E11 All The Cheesecakes.txt,Joey,"All right, I should get going, big day a work. Y’know I’m in a coma? Today, they do this test on me and it turns out I’m not brain dead.",9
S07E11 All The Cheesecakes.txt,Chandler,So…,9
S07E11 All The Cheesecakes.txt,Joey,"Ah-ah-ah Mr. Smartie Pants, it’s just not my character that’s not brain dead. Hey, so Pheebs, we still on for tonight?",9
S07E11 All The Cheesecakes.txt,Phoebe,Absolutely!,9
S07E11 All The Cheesecakes.txt,Joey,I’ll see you at 8:00.,9
S07E11 All The Cheesecakes.txt,Chandler,"Oh, what’s at 8:00?",10
S07E11 All The Cheesecakes.txt,Phoebe,"Oh, I have dinner plans with Joey. We get together about once a month to discuss the rest of you guys.",10
S07E11 All The Cheesecakes.txt,Ross,"Wow, did not know that! May I say how lovely you look today?",10
S07E11 All The Cheesecakes.txt,Phoebe,Duly noted.,10
S07E11 All The Cheesecakes.txt,Monica,What are you talking about?,11
S07E11 All The Cheesecakes.txt,Ross,"Cousin Frannie’s wedding, its tomorrow night.",11
S07E11 All The Cheesecakes.txt,Monica,You were invited?!,11
S07E11 All The Cheesecakes.txt,Ross,No.,11
S07E11 All The Cheesecakes.txt,Monica,"My God, I can’t believe this! I mean I knew that mom and dad were invited, but I thought that was it! I mean from the ages 7 to 9 Frannie and I were inseparable!",11
S07E11 All The Cheesecakes.txt,Chandler,"Well, maybe since the age of 9, Frannie’s made some new friends.",11
S07E11 All The Cheesecakes.txt,Ross,"Well l-look okay, it’s probably just a mistake. Let me call Aunt Sheryl okay? Maybe you are invited and the invitation just got lost in the mail.",11
S07E11 All The Cheesecakes.txt,Monica,"Yeah, well you call her and tell her that y’know when we were kids her precious little Frannie tried to undress me several times, okay? And if I hadn’t have stopped her, there probably wouldn’t even be a wedding to go too.",11
S07E11 All The Cheesecakes.txt,Ross,"Y’know, she tried to undress me too.",11
S07E11 All The Cheesecakes.txt,Phoebe,Joseph Francis Tribbiani are you home yet?!!,13
S07E11 All The Cheesecakes.txt,Rachel,"Umm, I think he’s still out. What’s wrong?",13

S07E11 All The Cheesecakes.txt,Phoebe,Oh! Here’s Joseph Francis!,17
S07E11 All The Cheesecakes.txt,Joey,Oh-Wha-Ho! What are you middle naming me for?! I left you a note!,17
S07E11 All The Cheesecakes.txt,Phoebe,So what?! That doesn’t give you the right to ditch me!,17
S07E11 All The Cheesecakes.txt,Joey,"Hey, you can cancel plans with friends if there is the possibility for sex!",17
S07E11 All The Cheesecakes.txt,Ross,"Phoebe he’s right, that is the rule.",17
S07E11 All The Cheesecakes.txt,Joey,Wow! I’m so sorry; I had no idea it would bother you this much.,18
S07E11 All The Cheesecakes.txt,Phoebe,"Well, it does.",18
S07E11 All The Cheesecakes.txt,Phoebe,"Okay, you wore me down.",19
S07E11 All The Cheesecakes.txt,Ross,"Hey Joe, while you’re over there how about another beer for the Ross-A-Tron?",19
S07E11 All The Cheesecakes.txt,Rachel,Hi!,21
S07E11 All The Cheesecakes.txt,Chandler,Another cheesecake came! They delivered it to the wrong address again!,21
S07E11 All The Cheesecakes.txt,Rachel,"So just bring it back downstairs, what’s the problem?",21
S07E11 All The Cheesecakes.txt,Chandler,I can’t seem to say goodbye.,21
S07E11 All The Cheesecakes.txt,Rachel,"Are you serious?! Chandler, we ate an entire cheesecake two days ago and you want more?",21
S07E11 All The Cheesecakes.txt,Chandler,Well I’ve forgotten what it tastes like okay?!,21
S07E11 All The Cheesecakes.txt,Rachel,Yeah and we’ll drop it off downstairs so that we’re not tempted.,23
S07E11 All The Cheesecakes.txt,Chandler,Good idea. Where do you want to go to lunch?,23
S07E11 All The Cheesecakes.txt,Joey,Awww! Mel Torme died.,25
S07E11 All The Cheesecakes.txt,Monica,"Joey, that paper’s like a year old!",25
S07E11 All The Cheesecakes.txt,Joey,Aw! Does that mean the Sam Goody’s sale is over?!,25
S07E11 All The Cheesecakes.txt,Joey,Hey.,26
S07E11 All The Cheesecakes.txt,Monica,Hey.,26
S07E11 All The Cheesecakes.txt,Ross,"So I finally heard back from Aunt Sheryl and apparently it wasn’t a mistake. Ahh, there’s-there’s limited seating in the hall.",26
S07E11 All The Cheesecakes.txt,Ross,"Well yeah, but she doesn’t know that. I mean, the last time she saw you-you would’ve turned one of those little wedding chairs into kindling.",27
S07E11 All The Cheesecakes.txt,Ross,"Oh what’s the big deal?! I wasn’t even invited to the ceremony, just the reception. And-and y’know what? If it makes you feel any better, Joan and I will just make an appearance and then, and then we’ll-we’ll leave early as a sign of protest.",28
S07E11 All The Cheesecakes.txt,Monica,Joan?,28
S07E11 All The Cheesecakes.txt,Ross,"Yeah, Joan Tedeski my date. She’s an assistant professor in the Linguistics department. Tall, very beautiful, and despite what some people say, not broad backed!",28
S07E11 All The Cheesecakes.txt,Monica,"Wait a minute, you got Ross Gellar and guest?! I wasn’t invited and you got ""and guest?!""",28
S07E11 All The Cheesecakes.txt,Joey,"Uh-uh, excuse me, I do have to interrupt on Ross’s behalf. I-I think the rule applies here y’know, since she has a chance to get on broad back…",28
S07E11 All The Cheesecakes.txt,Monica,"Wait a minute, y’know, you’re bringing me!",29
S07E11 All The Cheesecakes.txt,Ross,What? I can’t cancel on Joan!,29
S07E11 All The Cheesecakes.txt,Monica,Why not?!,29
S07E11 All The Cheesecakes.txt,Ross,"Bec—Did you not hear me?! She’s an assistant professor in the Linguistics department, okay? They’re wild! Why do you want to come anyway?",29
S07E11 All The Cheesecakes.txt,Monica,"Because! She’s my cousin. I mean, we grew up together! We’re family y’know? Well that’s important to me.",29
S07E11 All The Cheesecakes.txt,Joey,"Aww that’s nice. Family should be there, huh? This is her wedding, happiest day of her life.",30
S07E11 All The Cheesecakes.txt,Chandler,"Well, thank you for lunch.",32
S07E11 All The Cheesecakes.txt,Rachel,"What? Wait a minute, I didn’t pay, I thought you paid!",32
S07E11 All The Cheesecakes.txt,Rachel,She could be out of town. Maybe she’ll be gone for months.,35
S07E11 All The Cheesecakes.txt,Chandler,"By then, the cheesecake may have gone bad. We don’t want her to come back to bad cheesecake.",35
S07E11 All The Cheesecakes.txt,Rachel,No that could kill her.,35
S07E11 All The Cheesecakes.txt,Chandler,"Well, we don’t want that.",35
S07E11 All The Cheesecakes.txt,Rachel,No so we’re protecting her.,35
S07E11 All The Cheesecakes.txt,Chandler,But we should take it.,35
S07E11 All The Cheesecakes.txt,Rachel,But we should move quick.,35
S07E11 All The Cheesecakes.txt,Chandler,Why?,35
S07E11 All The Cheesecakes.txt,Rachel,Because I think I just heard her moving around in there.,35
S07E11 All The Cheesecakes.txt,Monica,David who?,38
S07E11 All The Cheesecakes.txt,Phoebe,"David the scientist guy, David that I was in love with, David who went to Russia and broke my heart David!",38
S07E11 All The Cheesecakes.txt,Phoebe,"Oh, you say someone’s name enough, they turn around.",39
S07E11 All The Cheesecakes.txt,David,Phoebe?,39
S07E11 All The Cheesecakes.txt,David,"Yeah, I’m just, I’m just in town for a conference. Umm, God you look phenomenal!",40
S07E11 All The Cheesecakes.txt,Phoebe,Well… Yeah. You look great too. Did you get a haircut?,40
S07E11 All The Cheesecakes.txt,David,Yeah. Well I-I got like thirty of them.,40
S07E11 All The Cheesecakes.txt,Phoebe,Yeah.,40
S07E11 All The Cheesecakes.txt,David,"Umm, look I-I-I got a confession to make…",40
S07E11 All The Cheesecakes.txt,Phoebe,Uh-huh.,40
S07E11 All The Cheesecakes.txt,David,"Uh, I-I-I was hoping to run into you here. I didn’t know whether I should call or not, y’know I-I was only in town for a few days. And y’know, I didn’t want to intrude on your life or-or anything like that, but I-I really wanted to see you and—but I didn’t know if you wanted to see me.",40
S07E11 All The Cheesecakes.txt,Phoebe,"Well, of course I would want to see you. I…I think about you all the time.",40
S07E11 All The Cheesecakes.txt,David,Really? Because I think about you all the time.,40
S07E11 All The Cheesecakes.txt,Phoebe,Really?,40
S07E11 All The Cheesecakes.txt,David,"I mean, there’s a statue in Minsk…",40
S07E11 All The Cheesecakes.txt,Phoebe,Uh-huh.,40
S07E11 All The Cheesecakes.txt,David,"That reminds me of you so much, I mean umm, it-it’s actually of Lenin. But, y’know at certain angles…",40
S07E11 All The Cheesecakes.txt,Phoebe,Yeah.,40
S07E11 All The Cheesecakes.txt,David,"Umm, anyway…Do you want to have dinner tonight?",40
S07E11 All The Cheesecakes.txt,Phoebe,"I can’t. I can’t believe I have plans, I can’t. Can you do it tomorrow night though?",42
S07E11 All The Cheesecakes.txt,David,"Uh no, I have to go in a few hours. I have to be on the red-eye. Well listen, y’know, next time you’re in Minsk umm…",42
S07E11 All The Cheesecakes.txt,Monica,"Phoebe, can I talk to you for a second?",42
S07E11 All The Cheesecakes.txt,Monica,What are you doing?,43
S07E11 All The Cheesecakes.txt,Phoebe,"Well, I have plans with Joey tonight.",43
S07E11 All The Cheesecakes.txt,Monica,So! He’ll understand!,43
S07E11 All The Cheesecakes.txt,Phoebe,"No he won’t. And that’s not even the point! Monica, I made a whole speech about you do not cancel plans with friends! And now y’know what? Just because, potentially, the love of my life comes back from Russia just for one night, I-I should change my beliefs?! I should change beliefs! No! No! No, if I don’t have my principles, I don’t have anything!",43
S07E11 All The Cheesecakes.txt,Monica,"God, you are so strong.",43
S07E11 All The Cheesecakes.txt,Phoebe,Or! I should rush through dinner with Joey and I can meet David at 9:00!,43
S07E11 All The Cheesecakes.txt,Chandler,"I’m full, and yet I know if I stop eating this, I’ll regret it.",45
S07E11 All The Cheesecakes.txt,Rachel,Hey!,46
S07E11 All The Cheesecakes.txt,Chandler,What are you doing tonight?,48
S07E11 All The Cheesecakes.txt,Chandler,"Oh really? Uh, Monica said she had a date at 9:00.",51
S07E11 All The Cheesecakes.txt,Joey,What?! Tonight?!,51
S07E11 All The Cheesecakes.txt,Chandler,That’s what Monica said.,51
S07E11 All The Cheesecakes.txt,Joey,After she gave me that big speech?! She goes and makes a date with a guy on the same night she has plans with me? I think she’s trying to pull a fast one on Big Daddy!,51
S07E11 All The Cheesecakes.txt,Monica,I’m Monica Gellar. Who do you know the bride and groom?,54
S07E11 All The Cheesecakes.txt,Monica,Used to work with her. Used to! I’m a relative and I didn’t get invited! A blood relative! Blood!!,54
S07E11 All The Cheesecakes.txt,Monica,"Okay, you’re fine.",56

S07E11 All The Cheesecakes.txt,Joey,"Yeah, this slow roasted salmon, just how slow are we talkin’ here?",58
S07E11 All The Cheesecakes.txt,Joey,"Ohh, then no. Maybe I should hear those specials again.",58
S07E11 All The Cheesecakes.txt,Phoebe,Huh?,61
S07E11 All The Cheesecakes.txt,Joey,"You were right before. I mean, friends are so important.",61
S07E11 All The Cheesecakes.txt,Joey,Y’know-y’know what I really want?,62
S07E11 All The Cheesecakes.txt,Phoebe,What?,62
S07E11 All The Cheesecakes.txt,Joey,"Is to have a long, long talk. Y’know? Get Joey out on the open road and really open him up.",62
S07E11 All The Cheesecakes.txt,Joey,Yes! I will have the lobster ravioli.,63
S07E11 All The Cheesecakes.txt,Phoebe,"God Joey, this is taking forever!",63
S07E11 All The Cheesecakes.txt,Joey,What’s the rush? What?,63
S07E11 All The Cheesecakes.txt,Phoebe,W-w—I just—it’s that—I have—y’know I have-I have an appointment. And it’s very important.,63
S07E11 All The Cheesecakes.txt,Joey,"Whoa-whoa, what is it?",63
S07E11 All The Cheesecakes.txt,Phoebe,Well… It’s a date.,63
S07E11 All The Cheesecakes.txt,Joey,"A date?! No, no Pheebs you-you must be mistaken, because I know you wouldn’t schedule a date on the same night you have plans with a friend!",63
S07E11 All The Cheesecakes.txt,Phoebe,"Come on Joey, don’t make me feel badly about this.",63
S07E11 All The Cheesecakes.txt,Joey,"No, I’m gonna!! That’s right! Yeah, you made me feel really guilty about goin’ out with that girl! Like-like-like I did something terrible to you! And now Pheebs, you’re doing the same thing!",63

S07E11 All The Cheesecakes.txt,Joey,"Okay, well my girl from the other night was special. She was a scientist too!",63

S07E11 All The Cheesecakes.txt,Joey,Fine!,64
S07E11 All The Cheesecakes.txt,Phoebe,Hey!,67
S07E11 All The Cheesecakes.txt,David,"Hey! Oh, I was just about to leave. I-I-I-I didn’t think you were coming.",67
S07E11 All The Cheesecakes.txt,Phoebe,"Oh, I wouldn’t miss this.",67
S07E11 All The Cheesecakes.txt,Chandler,Are you eating the cheesecake without me?!,70
S07E11 All The Cheesecakes.txt,Rachel,"Oh, what are you going to do?! Are you gonna go run tell Monica?! Are you gonna tell Joey?! No! Because then you will have to tell them what we did! We are desert stealers! We are living outside the law!",72
S07E11 All The Cheesecakes.txt,Rachel,What?! What?!,73
S07E11 All The Cheesecakes.txt,Chandler,Oh yes!,73
S07E11 All The Cheesecakes.txt,Rachel,Wait a minute!,73
S07E11 All The Cheesecakes.txt,Chandler,Oh yes!,73

S01E01 Monica Gets A Roommate.txt,Ross,"Okay, sure.",42
S01E01 Monica Gets A Roommate.txt,Joey,"Hey Pheebs, you wanna help?",42
S01E01 Monica Gets A Roommate.txt,Phoebe,"Oh, I wish I could, but I don't want to.",42
S01E01 Monica Gets A Roommate.txt,Joey,I'm thinking we've got a bookcase here.,47
S01E01 Monica Gets A Roommate.txt,Chandler,It's a beautiful thing.,47
S01E01 Monica Gets A Roommate.txt,Chandler,I would have to say that is an 'L'-shaped bracket.,48
S01E01 Monica Gets A Roommate.txt,Joey,Which goes where?,48
S01E01 Monica Gets A Roommate.txt,Chandler,I have no idea.,48

S01E01 Monica Gets A Roommate.txt,Chandler,Oh my God!,50
S01E01 Monica Gets A Roommate.txt,Monica,Oh my God!,51
S01E01 Monica Gets A Roommate.txt,Paul,"I know, I know, I'm such an idiot. I guess I should have caught on when she started going to the dentist four and five times a week. I mean, how clean can teeth get?",51
S01E01 Monica Gets A Roommate.txt,Monica,"My brother's going through that right now, he's such a mess. How did you get through it?",51

S01E01 Monica Gets A Roommate.txt,Ross,I'm divorced!  I'm only 26 and I'm divorced!,55
S01E01 Monica Gets A Roommate.txt,Joey,Shut up!,55
S01E01 Monica Gets A Roommate.txt,Ross,That only took me an hour.,56
S01E01 Monica Gets A Roommate.txt,Chandler,"Look, Ross, you gotta understand, between us we haven't had a relationship that has lasted longer than a Mento.   You, however have had the love of a woman for four years.   Four years of closeness and sharing at the end of which she ripped your heart out, and that is why we don't do it!  I don't think that was my point!",56
S01E01 Monica Gets A Roommate.txt,Ross,"You know what the scariest part is? What if there's only one woman for everybody, y'know? I mean what if you get one woman- and that's it? Unfortunately in my case, there was only one woman- for her...",56
S01E01 Monica Gets A Roommate.txt,Joey,"What are you talking about? 'One woman'? That's like saying there's only one flavor of ice cream for you. Lemme tell you something, Ross. There's lots of flavors out there. There's Rocky Road, and Cookie Dough, and Bing! Cherry Vanilla. You could get 'em with Jimmies, or nuts, or whipped cream! This is the best thing that ever happened to you! You got married, you were, like, what, eight? Welcome back to the world! Grab a spoon!",56
S01E01 Monica Gets A Roommate.txt,Ross,I honestly don't know if I'm hungry or horny.,56
S01E01 Monica Gets A Roommate.txt,Paul,"Ever since she walked out on me, I, uh...",57
S01E01 Monica Gets A Roommate.txt,Monica,"What?..... What, you wanna spell it out with noodles?",57
S01E01 Monica Gets A Roommate.txt,Paul,"No, it's, it's more of a fifth date kinda revelation.",57
S01E01 Monica Gets A Roommate.txt,Monica,"Oh, so there is gonna be a fifth date?",57
S01E01 Monica Gets A Roommate.txt,Paul,Isn't there?,57
S01E01 Monica Gets A Roommate.txt,Monica,"Yeah... yeah, I think there is. -What were you gonna say?",57
S01E01 Monica Gets A Roommate.txt,Paul,It's okay...,59
S01E01 Monica Gets A Roommate.txt,Monica,I know being spit on is probably not what you need right now. Um... how long?,59
S01E01 Monica Gets A Roommate.txt,Paul,Two years.,59
S01E01 Monica Gets A Roommate.txt,Monica,Wow! I'm-I'm-I'm glad you smashed her watch!,59
S01E01 Monica Gets A Roommate.txt,Paul,"So you still think you, um... might want that fifth date?",59
S01E01 Monica Gets A Roommate.txt,Rachel,Oh...see... but Joanne loved Chachi! That's the difference!,61

S01E01 Monica Gets A Roommate.txt,Monica,We'll talk later.,72
S01E01 Monica Gets A Roommate.txt,Joey,That wasn't a real date?! What the hell do you do on a real date?,73

S01E01 Monica Gets A Roommate.txt,Joey,I doubt it. Mostly regional work.,74
S01E01 Monica Gets A Roommate.txt,Monica,"Oh wait, wait, unless you happened to catch the Reruns' production of Pinocchio, at the little theater in the park.",74
S01E01 Monica Gets A Roommate.txt,Joey,"Look, it was a job all right?",74
S01E01 Monica Gets A Roommate.txt,Chandler,"'Look, Gippetto, I'm a real live boy.'",74
S01E01 Monica Gets A Roommate.txt,Monica,So how you doing today? Did you sleep okay? Talk to Barry? I can't stop smiling.,77
S01E01 Monica Gets A Roommate.txt,Rachel,I can see that. You look like you slept with a hanger in your mouth.,77
S01E01 Monica Gets A Roommate.txt,Monica,"I know, he's just so, so... Do you remember you and Tony DeMarco?",77

S01E01 Monica Gets A Roommate.txt,Monica,"Hey Frannie, welcome back! How was Florida?",80
S01E01 Monica Gets A Roommate.txt,Frannie,"You had sex, didn't you?",80
S01E01 Monica Gets A Roommate.txt,Monica,How do you do that?,80
S01E01 Monica Gets A Roommate.txt,Frannie,"Oh, I hate you, I'm pushing my Aunt Roz through Parrot Jungle and you're having sex!  So? Who?",80
S01E01 Monica Gets A Roommate.txt,Monica,You know Paul?,80
S01E01 Monica Gets A Roommate.txt,Frannie,"Paul the Wine Guy? Oh yeah, I know Paul.",80
S01E01 Monica Gets A Roommate.txt,Monica,You mean you know Paul like I know Paul?,80
S01E01 Monica Gets A Roommate.txt,Frannie,"Are you kidding? I take credit for Paul. Y'know before me, there was no snap in his turtle for two years.",80
S01E01 Monica Gets A Roommate.txt,Monica,"Why?! Why? Why, why would anybody do something like that?",82
S01E01 Monica Gets A Roommate.txt,Ross,I assume we're looking for an answer more sophisticated than 'to get you into bed'.,82
S01E01 Monica Gets A Roommate.txt,Monica,I hate men!  I hate men!,82
S01E01 Monica Gets A Roommate.txt,Phoebe,"Oh no, don't hate, you don't want to put that out into the universe.",82
S01E01 Monica Gets A Roommate.txt,Monica,Is it me? Is it like I have some sort of beacon that only dogs and men with severe emotional problems can hear?,82
S01E01 Monica Gets A Roommate.txt,Monica,"I just thought he was nice, y'know?",83
S01E01 Monica Gets A Roommate.txt,Rachel,Guess what?,85
S01E01 Monica Gets A Roommate.txt,Ross,You got a job?,85
S01E01 Monica Gets A Roommate.txt,Rachel,Are you kidding? I'm trained for nothing! I was laughed out of twelve interviews today.,85
S01E01 Monica Gets A Roommate.txt,Chandler,And yet you're surprisingly upbeat.,85
S01E01 Monica Gets A Roommate.txt,Rachel,"You would be too if you found John and David boots on sale, fifty percent off!",85
S01E01 Monica Gets A Roommate.txt,Chandler,"Oh, how well you know me...",85
S01E01 Monica Gets A Roommate.txt,Rachel,"They're my new 'I don't need a job, I don't need my parents, I've got great boots' boots!",85
S01E01 Monica Gets A Roommate.txt,Monica,How'd you pay for them?,85
S01E01 Monica Gets A Roommate.txt,Rachel,"Uh, credit card.",85
S01E01 Monica Gets A Roommate.txt,Monica,And who pays for that?,85
S01E01 Monica Gets A Roommate.txt,Rachel,Um... my... father.,85
S01E01 Monica Gets A Roommate.txt,Rachel,"Oh God, come on you guys, is this really necessary?  I mean, I can stop charging anytime I want.",86
S01E01 Monica Gets A Roommate.txt,Monica,"C'mon, you can't live off your parents your whole life.",86
S01E01 Monica Gets A Roommate.txt,Rachel,I know that. That's why I was getting married.,86
S01E01 Monica Gets A Roommate.txt,Phoebe,"Give her a break, it's hard being on your own for the first time.",86
S01E01 Monica Gets A Roommate.txt,Rachel,Thank you.,86
S01E01 Monica Gets A Roommate.txt,Phoebe,"You're welcome. I remember when I first came to this city. I was fourteen. My mom had just killed herself and my step-dad was back in prison, and I got here, and I didn't know anybody. And I ended up living with this albino guy who was, like, cleaning windshields outside port authority, and then he killed himself, and then I found aromatherapy. So believe me, I know exactly how you feel.",86
S01E01 Monica Gets A Roommate.txt,Ross,The word you're looking for is 'Anyway'...,87
S01E01 Monica Gets A Roommate.txt,Monica,"All right, you ready?",87
S01E01 Monica Gets A Roommate.txt,Rachel,"No.  No, no, I'm not ready!  How can I be ready?  ""Hey, Rach!  You ready to jump out the airplane without your parachute?""  Come on, I can't do this!",87
S01E01 Monica Gets A Roommate.txt,Monica,"You can, I know you can!",87
S01E01 Monica Gets A Roommate.txt,Rachel,I don't think so.,87
S01E01 Monica Gets A Roommate.txt,Ross,"C'mon, cut. Cut, cut, cut,...",88
S01E01 Monica Gets A Roommate.txt,Rachel,Y'know what?  I think we can just leave it at that.  It's kinda like a symbolic gesture...,89
S01E01 Monica Gets A Roommate.txt,Monica, Rachel!  That was a library card!,89
S01E01 Monica Gets A Roommate.txt,All,"Cut, cut, cut, cut, cut, cut, cut..",89

S01E01 Monica Gets A Roommate.txt,Ross,Split it?,96
S01E01 Monica Gets A Roommate.txt,Rachel,Okay.,96
S01E01 Monica Gets A Roommate.txt,Rachel,I knew.,97
S01E01 Monica Gets A Roommate.txt,Ross,You did! Oh.... I always figured you just thought I was Monica's geeky older brother.,97
S01E01 Monica Gets A Roommate.txt,Rachel,I did.,97
S01E01 Monica Gets A Roommate.txt,Ross,"Oh. Listen, do you think- and try not to let my intense vulnerability become any kind of a factor here- but do you think it would be okay if I asked you out? Sometime? Maybe?",97
S01E01 Monica Gets A Roommate.txt,Rachel,"Yeah, maybe...",97
S01E01 Monica Gets A Roommate.txt,Ross,"Okay... okay, maybe I will...",97
S01E01 Monica Gets A Roommate.txt,Rachel,Goodnight.,97
S01E01 Monica Gets A Roommate.txt,Ross,Goodnight.,97
S01E01 Monica Gets A Roommate.txt,Monica,"See ya.... Waitwait, what's with you?",98
S01E01 Monica Gets A Roommate.txt,Joey,I can't believe what I'm hearing here.,100
S01E01 Monica Gets A Roommate.txt,Monica,What? I-I said you had a-,101
S01E01 Monica Gets A Roommate.txt,Phoebe,"Oh, was I doing it again?",103

S01E01 Monica Gets A Roommate.txt,Monica,"I said that you had a nice butt, it's just not a great butt.",103
S01E01 Monica Gets A Roommate.txt,Joey,"Oh, you wouldn't know a great butt if it came up and bit ya.",103
S01E01 Monica Gets A Roommate.txt,Ross,There's an image.,103
S01E01 Monica Gets A Roommate.txt,Chandler,"Did you make it, or are you just serving it?",104
S01E01 Monica Gets A Roommate.txt,Rachel,I'm just serving it.,104
S01E01 Monica Gets A Roommate.txt,All,"Yeah. Yeah, I'll have a cup of coffee.",104
S01E01 Monica Gets A Roommate.txt,Chandler,"Okay, so, I'm in Las Vegas... I'm Liza Minelli-",107
S02E22 The Two Parties.txt,Monica,"So, I'll get candles and my mom's lace tablecloth, and since it's Rachel's birthday, I mean, we want it to be special, I thought I'd poach a salmon.",2
S02E22 The Two Parties.txt,All,Ohhh.,2
S02E22 The Two Parties.txt,Monica,What?,2
S02E22 The Two Parties.txt,Ross,Question. Why do we always have to have parties where you poach things?,2
S02E22 The Two Parties.txt,Monica,You wanna be in charge of the food committee?,2
S02E22 The Two Parties.txt,Ross,Question two. Why do we always have to have parties with committees?,2
S02E22 The Two Parties.txt,Joey,Really. Why can't we just get some pizzas and get some beers and have fun?,2
S02E22 The Two Parties.txt,Ross,Yeah.,2
S02E22 The Two Parties.txt,Phoebe,"Yeah, I agree. Ya know, I think fancy parties are only fun if you're fancy on the inside and I'm just not sure we are.",2
S02E22 The Two Parties.txt,Monica,"Alright. If you guys don't want it to be special, fine. You can throw any kind of party you want.",2
S02E22 The Two Parties.txt,Chandler,"Wow, it's, it's like porno for clowns.",4
S02E22 The Two Parties.txt,Ross,"I talked to Rachel's sisters, neither of them can come.",5
S02E22 The Two Parties.txt,Monica,"Ok, um so, I still have to invite Dillon and Emma and Shannon Cooper.",5
S02E22 The Two Parties.txt,Joey,"Woah, woah, woah, uh, no Shannon Cooper.",5
S02E22 The Two Parties.txt,Phoebe,Why not her?,5
S02E22 The Two Parties.txt,Joey,"Cause she uh, she steals stuff.",5
S02E22 The Two Parties.txt,Chandler,Or maybe she doesn't steal stuff and Joey just slept with her and never called her back.,5
S02E22 The Two Parties.txt,Monica,Joey that is horriable.,5
S02E22 The Two Parties.txt,Joey,"Hey I liked her, alright. Maybe, maybe too much. I don't know I guess I just got scared.",5
S02E22 The Two Parties.txt,Phoebe,"I'm sorry, I didn't know.",5
S02E22 The Two Parties.txt,Joey,"I didn't think anyone'd buy that, ok.",5
S02E22 The Two Parties.txt,Ross,"Hi honey, how did it go?",6
S02E22 The Two Parties.txt,Rachel,"Agh, it was the graduation from hell.",6
S02E22 The Two Parties.txt,Chandler,"Ya know, my cousin went to hell on a football scholarship.",6
S02E22 The Two Parties.txt,Rachel,"Ya know, I mean this is supposed to be a joyous occasion. My sister's graduating from college, nobody thought she would. It's a true testament to what a girl from long island would do for a Celica.",6
S02E22 The Two Parties.txt,Monica,So what happened?,6
S02E22 The Two Parties.txt,Rachel,"My parents happened. All they had to do was sit in the same stadium, smile proudly, and not talk about the divorce. But nooo, they got into a huge fight in the middle of the commencement address. Bishop Tutu actually had to stop and shush them. But you know what, you know what the good news is? I get to serve coffee for the next 8 hours.",6
S02E22 The Two Parties.txt,Phoebe,"Ok, so I guess we don't invite her parents.",6
S02E22 The Two Parties.txt,Monica,"Well, how bout just her mom?",6
S02E22 The Two Parties.txt,Chandler,Why her mom?,6
S02E22 The Two Parties.txt,Monica,Cause I already invited her.,6
S02E22 The Two Parties.txt,Phoebe,"Ooh, ooh, did you ask Stacy Roth?",6
S02E22 The Two Parties.txt,Joey,"Oh no, can't invite her. She also steals.",6
S02E22 The Two Parties.txt,Phoebe,"Ok, here are the birthday candles. Where's the birthday cake?",7
S02E22 The Two Parties.txt,Monica,"Ok, we're not having birthday cake, we're having birthday flan.",7
S02E22 The Two Parties.txt,Chandler,Excuse me?,7
S02E22 The Two Parties.txt,Monica,It's a traditional Mexican custard dessert.,7
S02E22 The Two Parties.txt,Joey,"Oh that's nice. Happy birthday Rachel, here's some goo.",7
S02E22 The Two Parties.txt,Monica,"No no, the father can, but um, since I am the roommate I can tell you that she's not here and I'll pass along the message, ok. So bye-bye.",9
S02E22 The Two Parties.txt,Monica,"No, no, not a party. Just a surprise gathering of some people Rachel knows. Um, this is Phoebe and Chandler and Joey.",9
S02E22 The Two Parties.txt,Chandler,"This isn't your first surprise party, is it sir?",9
S02E22 The Two Parties.txt,Monica,Chinese menu guy. Forgot the menus.,11
S02E22 The Two Parties.txt,Chandler,"So, basically just a Chinese guy.",11
S02E22 The Two Parties.txt,Joey,"Uh, hey, Dr. Greene, why don't you come with me, we'll put your jacket on Rachel's bed.",11
S02E22 The Two Parties.txt,Monica,"Sandra, I am so sorry, I thought you were Rachel and we just weren't ready for you yet.",12
S02E22 The Two Parties.txt,Chandler,"Yes because uh, you look so young.",12
S02E22 The Two Parties.txt,Phoebe,"And because you're both, you know, white women.",12
S02E22 The Two Parties.txt,Chandler,"NO! No, I'll take that for ya.",12
S02E22 The Two Parties.txt,Monica,"Oh my God, oh my God, oh my God.",14
S02E22 The Two Parties.txt,Chandler,"Ok, think, what would Jack and Chrissy do?",14
S02E22 The Two Parties.txt,Monica,"So uh, Joey and Chanlder, I, I think it's time that you take Dr. Greene over to your place.",15
S02E22 The Two Parties.txt,Chandler,"Uhh, yes, absdolutely, um. Why again?",15
S02E22 The Two Parties.txt,Monica,Because that's where the party is you goon. See this is just the staging area.,15
S02E22 The Two Parties.txt,Joey,Right this is staging.,15
S02E22 The Two Parties.txt,Chandler,"Yeah, this more than anything else, is the staging area.",15
S02E22 The Two Parties.txt,Rachel,"Ohh, thank you for the wonderful dinner.",20

S02E22 The Two Parties.txt,Chandler,"Well, we could count again.",23
S02E22 The Two Parties.txt,Rachel,I can't believe this is happening.,23
S02E22 The Two Parties.txt,Ross,"You know what, this is ridiculous, ok. This is your birthday, this is your party. I say we just put 'em all together and if they can't deal with it, who cares.",23
S02E22 The Two Parties.txt,Rachel,I do.,23
S02E22 The Two Parties.txt,Ross,That's who.,23

S02E22 The Two Parties.txt,Rachel,"It's just this thing. Every year we would go out on my dad's boat and watch the fireworks. Mom always hated it because the ocean air made her hair all big. My sister Jill would be throwing up over the side and my dad would be upset becasue nobody was helping and then when we did help he would scream at us for doing it wrong. But then when the fireworks started, everybody just shut up, you know, and it'd get really cold, and we would all just sort of smush under this one blanket.

S05E23 In Vegas.txt,Monica,"The strange part was, he was really nice, umm and he looks great, but I didn't feel anything at all!",31
S05E23 In Vegas.txt,Phoebe,Ooh! So now why can't we tell Chandler?,31

S05E23 In Vegas.txt,Chandler,"Okay this is great, but Joey said he didn't want any of us out there.",35
S05E23 In Vegas.txt,Monica,"Oh, he just doesn't want us to go through any trouble. Think of how excited he'll be when we go out and surprise him! Plus we get to have our own, ani-Vegas-ary! A-Nevadaversary!",35

S05E23 In Vegas.txt,Phoebe,"Oh yeah, so you can walk around naked.",40

S05E23 In Vegas.txt,Phoebe,Naked alone time.,40
S05E23 In Vegas.txt,Rachel,"No! Phoebe just because I'm alone doesn’t mean I wanna walk around naked. I mean, you live alone, you don't walk around naked.",40
S05E23 In Vegas.txt,Phoebe,Uh-huh! Why do you think it takes me so long to answer the door?,40
S05E23 In Vegas.txt,Phoebe,"So, so far is this trip to Vegas better or worse than the trip to London?",41

S05E23 In Vegas.txt,Chandler,What Richard thing?,47
S05E23 In Vegas.txt,Monica,"Okay, I umm, I ran into Richard yesterday and he asked me if I wanted to go for a bite and I did. The only reason I didn't tell you is because I knew you'd get mad and I didn't want to spoil our anniversary.",48

S05E23 In Vegas.txt,Monica,I knew you were not okay with that.,72
S05E23 In Vegas.txt,Phoebe,So you're a gladiator! Wow!,72

S05E23 In Vegas.txt,Monica,"It meant nothing! Okay? After all this time, how can you not trust me?",72
S05E23 In Vegas.txt,Chandler,When you go lunching with hunky moustache men and don't tell me about it!,72
S05E23 In Vegas.txt,Monica,You're right. I'm sorry. I should've told you.,72
S05E23 In Vegas.txt,Joey,"Aww, there we go.",73

S05E23 In Vegas.txt,Ross,Is that so?,78
S05E23 In Vegas.txt,Rachel,Yeah.,78
S05E23 In Vegas.txt,Joey,"Hey, y'know in Roman times this was more than just a hat.",81
S05E23 In Vegas.txt,Chandler,Really?,81
S05E23 In Vegas.txt,Joey,"Yeah, sure! Sure! They would uh, they would scrub the floors with it! They would use it to get the mud off their shoe. And sometimes underneath the horse would get dirty so they would stick it right…",81
S05E23 In Vegas.txt,Joey,"All right well, I'll take you someplace nice then. Look! A guy tipped me a hundred bucks today.",82
S05E23 In Vegas.txt,Chandler,Whoa!,82
S05E23 In Vegas.txt,Joey,"Yeah-yeah, he was playing blackjack for like an hour and he won $5,000. Can you believe that? $5,000!",82
S05E23 In Vegas.txt,Joey,"Wait a minute! Why don't I do what that guy did? I'll take this $100 and turn it into $5,000! And then I'll turn that into enough money to get my movie going again!",83
S05E23 In Vegas.txt,Chandler,Good luck!,83
S05E23 In Vegas.txt,Joey,Chandler! I don't need luck. I have thought this through!,83
S05E23 In Vegas.txt,Chandler,I see.,83

S05E23 In Vegas.txt,Monica,I can't believe this! This is like the worst night ever!,86
S05E23 In Vegas.txt,Monica,"This is crazy! I mean, it's such a stupid argument. I don't even wanna see Richard again.",87
S05E23 In Vegas.txt,Phoebe,So go fix it! Go find Chandler! He's probably up in your room! Tell him that you're sorry and that you love him.,87
S05E23 In Vegas.txt,Monica,Hmm.,92
S05E23 In Vegas.txt,Rachel,"Yeah, all right. All right! Just keep walkin'! All right?",94

S05E23 In Vegas.txt,Chandler,"Again I must go back to, how?",109
S05E23 In Vegas.txt,Joey,"Hey, are you unsupporting me again?",111

S05E23 In Vegas.txt,Chandler,"Yeah, well, she's probably talking to Richard.",113
S05E23 In Vegas.txt,Phoebe,Would you stop that! Do you wanna know the first thing she said when she came back from her lunch with Richard? She didn't feel anything for him. She loves you!,113
S05E23 In Vegas.txt,Chandler,Really?,113

S02E04 Phoebes Husband.txt,Rachel,"And then, I don't know, I mean you'd pull me really close to you so that, so that I'd be pressed up, you know, right against you. And, um, it would get kind of sweaty and uh, and blurry, and then it's just happening.",38

S10E10 Chandler Gets Caught.txt,Phoebe,"Have you thought about what you would be giving up? You can't move out of the city, what if you want Chinese food at 5am? Or a fake Rolex that breaks as soon as it rains or an Asian hooker sent right to your door?",35
S10E10 Chandler Gets Caught.txt,Ross,"You know what, if you wanna look for a house, that's okay.",35

S09E18 The Lottery.txt,Ross,"Seriously you guys, I can't believe you're going to spend 250 dollars on the lottery, I mean that's such a bunch of boohaki.",7
S09E18 The Lottery.txt,Ross,"Oh oh, we think Emma is about to start talking so we're trying to be careful about what words we use in front of her.",8
S09E18 The Lottery.txt,Rachel,"Yeah so get ready to hear alot of ehm...boohaki, goshdarnit and brotherpucker.",8
S09E18 The Lottery.txt,Monica,How do you know she's gonna start talking?,8

S09E18 The Lottery.txt,Chandler,Kinda like Joey.,8
S09E18 The Lottery.txt,Monica,God! Look at all these tickets! It's so exciting! You know I haven't won anything since the sixth grade.,10
S09E18 The Lottery.txt,Chandler,Pie eating contest?,10
S09E18 The Lottery.txt,Monica,Oh! You assume because I was heavy that's the only way I could win something?,10
S09E18 The Lottery.txt,Chandler,"No, I saw a picture of you covered in blueberries.",10

S09E18 The Lottery.txt,Joey,Oh yeah! The casserole lady.,16
S09E18 The Lottery.txt,Ross,"Yeah, uh... and then I figured after you win, we could all go out to the balcony and see a night rainbow with gremlins dancing on top of it!",17
S09E18 The Lottery.txt,Monica,"Chandler is supposed to find out if he's getting an assistent job at his ad agency. But out of the 15 interns, they are only hiring three.",22

S09E18 The Lottery.txt,Monica,"Hey that reminds me, I thought we could use some extra luck so I brought a wishbone home from work.",29
S09E18 The Lottery.txt,Monica,"Alright, who wants to do it?",30
S09E18 The Lottery.txt,Phoebe,"Oh can I? Vegetarians never get to do the wishbone. It's really not fair either! You know, just because we don't eat the meat doesn't mean we don't like to play with the carcasses!",30
S09E18 The Lottery.txt,Monica,"Ok, hey Rach?",30
S09E18 The Lottery.txt,Rachel,"Oh no, I'm good, I don't wanna get that turkey smell all over my hands.",30
S09E18 The Lottery.txt,Joey,I'll do it!! It'll get the casserole stink off of mine.,30
S09E18 The Lottery.txt,Phoebe,I hope I win!,31
S09E18 The Lottery.txt,Monica,"Well, it doesn't really matter ... you're both wishing for the same thing, right?",31
S09E18 The Lottery.txt,Joey,I can't tell you what I'm wishing for! Else...you know...won't come true!,31
S09E18 The Lottery.txt,Monica,"Right! .. but we ""know"" what you're wishing for!",31
S09E18 The Lottery.txt,Joey,Can't really say!,31
S09E18 The Lottery.txt,Monica,"I understand, but you're wishing for what we think you're wishing for, aren't you?",31
S09E18 The Lottery.txt,Phoebe,"One, two, three!",32
S09E18 The Lottery.txt,Joey,"I won, hey!",33
S09E18 The Lottery.txt,Rachel,"You know, Ross, just keep making your jokes. How are you gonna feel if we actually do win?",34
S09E18 The Lottery.txt,Ross,"Uh, you're not gonna win.",34
S09E18 The Lottery.txt,Rachel,"Oh, I know, I know, the odds are against us, but somebody has to win, and it could be us! And then how you gonna feel? You know, we're gonna be all like ""oh everybody, let's take our helicopters up to the cape"" and you're gonna be all like ""oh, I can't guys, I'll meet you guys up there, I gotta gas up the Hyundai""",34
S09E18 The Lottery.txt,Ross,"Ok, I've heard myself on tape and I sound nothing like that.",34
S09E18 The Lottery.txt,Chandler,"I can see the headline now: ""Lottery winners' friend filled with regret eats own arm"".",34
S09E18 The Lottery.txt,Ross,Why would I eat my own arm?,34
S09E18 The Lottery.txt,Chandler,"Well you wouldn't, but we own the paper, we can print whatever we want.",34
S09E18 The Lottery.txt,Monica,"You know what, Ross? I'm gonna throw in 50 bucks for you.",34
S09E18 The Lottery.txt,Ross,Why?,34
S09E18 The Lottery.txt,Monica,"Because I know that you think the lottery is ""boohaki"" but we're all here and gonna watch the numbers and have fun. And you're my brother, and I want you to be a part of this.",34
S09E18 The Lottery.txt,Phoebe,Get a room!,35
S09E18 The Lottery.txt,Chandler,"Ok, so now that you're in, what are you gonna do if we win?",35
S09E18 The Lottery.txt,Ross,"I don't know, probably just invest it.",35
S09E18 The Lottery.txt,Chandler,Ooh! Calm down ...,35
S09E18 The Lottery.txt,Joey,"Seriously, that's your fantasy? To invest it?",35
S09E18 The Lottery.txt,Joey,"Ooh, ooh, I know! We should pool all own money and buy the Knicks!",36
S09E18 The Lottery.txt,Rachel,I don't really care about the Knicks.,36
S09E18 The Lottery.txt,Joey,"Oh, you will when I pick you as starting forward.",36
S09E18 The Lottery.txt,Chandler,"You know, I'm not sure a sports team is the way to go.",37
S09E18 The Lottery.txt,Joey,You're not gonna let me buy the Knicks?? I can't believe you're taking this away from me!,37
S09E18 The Lottery.txt,Chandler,"You're right, it has been you dream for over 15 seconds.",37
S09E18 The Lottery.txt,Ross,"Oh, I've gotten into the habit of calling Rachel ""Mommy"" when we're around Emma. Which I now realize we are not ...",40
S09E18 The Lottery.txt,Rachel,I'm hoping that if she hears it enough it will be her first word.,40
S09E18 The Lottery.txt,Ross,"Although if we're gonna do that, we should probably call me ""Daddy"" too.",40
S09E18 The Lottery.txt,Ross,I ... I was just talking about Rachel.,41
S09E18 The Lottery.txt,Joey,"Dude, I'm sorry. But hey, there's one spot left, right?",45
S09E18 The Lottery.txt,Chandler,"Well no, Charlie's gonna get that.",45
S09E18 The Lottery.txt,Monica,"Hey, don't say that! You got just as good a chance as anybody else of getting that job!",45
S09E18 The Lottery.txt,Chandler,He's the boss's son.,45
S09E18 The Lottery.txt,Rachel,"Ooh, you guys, it starts in like 20 minutes.",46
S09E18 The Lottery.txt,Rachel,"Ooh, I have another idea!",47
S09E18 The Lottery.txt,Monica,"I'm sorry, idea time is over.",47

S09E18 The Lottery.txt,Monica,"Hey, you just got in 5 minutes ago!",50
S09E18 The Lottery.txt,Ross,3 minutes ago!!! I don't know why that's important ...,50
S09E18 The Lottery.txt,Joey,"I was with you the whole time we were in Connecticut, when did you even get those?",50
S09E18 The Lottery.txt,Monica,When you were reading the dirty magazines without taking off the plastic!,50
S09E18 The Lottery.txt,Rachel,"Ok, well Monica, suppose one of your ""special"" tickets win? How are you gonna feel when you win the lottery and you lose all your friends?",51
S09E18 The Lottery.txt,Monica,"Please ... if I win the lottery, you guys are not gonna leave me. Someone gave me a basket of mini-muffins last week and I couldn't get rid of you for 3 days!",51
S09E18 The Lottery.txt,Rachel,"Chandler, would you just tell her what she did was wrong?",51
S09E18 The Lottery.txt,Monica,There's the man I married!!,54
S09E18 The Lottery.txt,Rachel,"All right, believe me.If you win the lottery, it's the last you're gonna hear from us!",54
S09E18 The Lottery.txt,Monica,"Fine! Don't be my friends! I'll buy new friends! Yeah, and then I'll pay for their plastic surgery so they'd look just like you!",54
S09E18 The Lottery.txt,Chandler,"Oh, yeah! Thanks for inventing the lottery!",60

S03E24 The Ultimate Fighting Champion.txt,Pete,"What, look back?",71
S03E24 The Ultimate Fighting Champion.txt,Monica,"Well, you’re not gonna get going are you?",71

S03E24 The Ultimate Fighting Champion.txt,Pete,Well I’m not gonna stop until I’m the Ultimate Fighting Champion.,71
S03E24 The Ultimate Fighting Champion.txt,Monica,That guy stood on your neck until you passed out!,71
S03E24 The Ultimate Fighting Champion.txt,Pete,"Let me tell you a story. When I set out to create Moss 865, do you think it just happened overnight? No. There was Moss 1, that burnt down my Dad’s garage, there was Moss 2 that would only schedule appointments in January, and 862 others that I learned from, just like I learned from this fight, never to let a guy stand on my neck.",71
S03E24 The Ultimate Fighting Champion.txt,Monica,You didn’t know that already?,71

S03E24 The Ultimate Fighting Champion.txt,Monica,Yeah. That-that was the problem.,72
S03E24 The Ultimate Fighting Champion.txt,Ross,Hey! How long until Pete’s fight?,74
S03E24 The Ultimate Fighting Champion.txt,Monica,"Oh, about five minutes. Right now they’re interviewing his opponent. Apparently he trains by going to Iran and pulling the arms off thieves.",74
S03E24 The Ultimate Fighting Champion.txt,Ross,Hot dog?,74
S03E24 The Ultimate Fighting Champion.txt,Phoebe,"So Ross, how umm, how did it go with Bonnie?",75

S03E24 The Ultimate Fighting Champion.txt,Doug,"Oh, you forgot?",83
S03E24 The Ultimate Fighting Champion.txt,Chandler,"No, no I just ah, didn’t do them. Instead, I ah, hung out with a couple of friends and had a couple of beers so I certainly don’t deserve any praise, verbal or otherwise.",83
S03E24 The Ultimate Fighting Champion.txt,Chandler,Doug!!,84
S03E24 The Ultimate Fighting Champion.txt,Doug,Hmm.,84
S03E24 The Ultimate Fighting Champion.txt,Chandler,I’m a little bit uncomfortable with the that way you express yourself.,84
S03E24 The Ultimate Fighting Champion.txt,Doug,"Oh, is it the swearing? I mean is it the constant swearing? Because I gotta tell ya, if it is, you can just... kiss my ass!",84
S03E24 The Ultimate Fighting Champion.txt,Chandler,"No, no. It-it’s not about the swearing, it’s more about ah, the way, that you ah, occasionally, concentrate, your enthusiasm on my buttock.",84
S03E24 The Ultimate Fighting Champion.txt,Doug,Oh?,84
S03E24 The Ultimate Fighting Champion.txt,Chandler,"Oh, and don’t get me wrong, I appreciate the sentiment. It’s just that I, I have a rather, sensitive posterior, and ah, besides, it’s making all the other guys jealous.",84
S03E24 The Ultimate Fighting Champion.txt,Doug,"Well, say no more. Y'know it takes guts to bring this up. Bing! You’re okay.",84
S03E24 The Ultimate Fighting Champion.txt,Phoebe,"Okay. Would you rather live in the shirt pocket of a sweaty giant, or inside his shower drain?",88
S03E24 The Ultimate Fighting Champion.txt,Rachel,"Come on Phoebe, look at that! They are not breaking up, look at them. Okay that’s, you know what that is? That is a, that is a second date, that’s what that is! Look at that, she just put her hand on his thigh...",93

S03E24 The Ultimate Fighting Champion.txt,Phoebe,"Okay, first of all, breathe. Second of all, I don’t get it. Aren’t you the one that decided that you didn’t want to be with Ross?",94
S03E24 The Ultimate Fighting Champion.txt,Phoebe,Well isn’t he your friend? Don’t you want him to be happy?,95
S03E24 The Ultimate Fighting Champion.txt,Rachel,Yes.,95

S03E24 The Ultimate Fighting Champion.txt,Monica,You are insane! You-you gotta give this up!,100
S03E24 The Ultimate Fighting Champion.txt,Pete,"I can’t until I’m the ultimate fighter. I will do it. I’m telling you, the day will come when children will argue over who will win a fight, me or Superman. Now, I’m not saying I could beat Superman, but y'know, kids are stupid.",100
S03E24 The Ultimate Fighting Champion.txt,Monica,"Sit down. All right? Please, just listen to me. You are terrible at this! Okay? You are the worst ultimate fighter ever! Ever!!",100
S03E24 The Ultimate Fighting Champion.txt,Pete,"Y'know I have a torn rotator cuff, a hairline fracture in my right forearm, and a severely bruised Adam’s Apple, but that really hurt.",100
S03E24 The Ultimate Fighting Champion.txt,Monica,"Well then, y'know what? I care about you to much to watch you hurt yourself like this. So if you have to do this, then you’re gonna have to do it without me.",100
S03E24 The Ultimate Fighting Champion.txt,Pete,"Well if you’re asking me to quit, then you’re asking me to be someone I’m not. I’ve got to do this.",100

S03E24 The Ultimate Fighting Champion.txt,Phoebe,"Wait, if that’s his favourite area, why is he being so mean to it?",111
S03E24 The Ultimate Fighting Champion.txt,Ross,"Well, this is ironic. Of your last two boyfriends, Richard didn’t want to have kids, and from the looks of it, now Pete can’t.",111
S06E13 Rachels Sister.txt,Chandler,This coming from the man who couldn’t split our 80 dollar phone bill in half.,3

And you know when I did it, I-I-I at first I was scared, and look at me now! I’m the only daughter dad is proud of! Okay, well this is, this is what you’re gonna do. You’re gonna get a job, you’re gonna get an apartment, and then I’ll help you and you can stay with us. Right Pheebs, she can stay with us?",23

S06E13 Rachels Sister.txt,Chandler,"Yeah, I don’t you should say that even when you’re healthy.",47
S06E13 Rachels Sister.txt,Chandler,Don’t take this personally okay? It’s just that I just can’t have sex with a sick person.,48
S06E13 Rachels Sister.txt,Monica,"I’m with you Chandler! I mean I can’t have sex with a sick person either, that’s disgusting! But I’m not sick! Let me prove it to you. We are two healthy people in the pribe of libe.",48

S06E13 Rachels Sister.txt,Rachel,What’s up?!,49
S06E13 Rachels Sister.txt,Phoebe,"Umm, I think there’s something you should maybe know.",49
S06E13 Rachels Sister.txt,Rachel,"Well, it’d better not be about the apartment pants, because I just pitched the idea to my boss at Ralph Lauren and she loved it.",49
S06E13 Rachels Sister.txt,Phoebe,"No. No. It’s just I was umm, I was with Ross and Jill after you left and umm, I’m pretty sure I saw a little spark between them.",49
S06E13 Rachels Sister.txt,Rachel,What?!,49
S06E13 Rachels Sister.txt,Phoebe,"Yeah I mean it’s probably nothing, but I just wanted to warn you that there might be something there.",49
S06E13 Rachels Sister.txt,Rachel,With Ross and Jill?,49

S06E13 Rachels Sister.txt,Phoebe,Okay then.,49
S06E13 Rachels Sister.txt,Rachel,"Oh my God! I can not believe that! I mean I don’t really like it when Ross goes out with anyone, but my sister isn’t that like incest or something?! Oh my God, and they’re gonna have sex! Oh! Oh no what if he marries her too?! Oh this is just terrible, this is just terrible. And I can’t stop it! I can’t—I don’t own Ross! Y’know? And Jill, she should be able to do whatever it is that she wants to do! And oh my God, I can’t believe Ross is marrying my little sister, this terrible.

S06E13 Rachels Sister.txt,Jill,No! I mean he’s nice.,54
S06E13 Rachels Sister.txt,Rachel,Yeah.,54
S06E13 Rachels Sister.txt,Jill,"He’s the kind of guy you’re friends with, y’know? But he’s not the kind of guy you date. He’s the kind of guy you’d date because you did. Me, not so much.",54
S06E13 Rachels Sister.txt,Rachel,"Oh not-not so much. Umm, what-what do you, what do you mean is there something wrong with Ross?",54
S06E13 Rachels Sister.txt,Jill,"Oh no-no-no, he’s just I don’t know, he’s just a little bookish.",54
S06E13 Rachels Sister.txt,Rachel,Are-are you saying he’s a geek?,54

S06E13 Rachels Sister.txt,Rachel,"No! No I, no Ross is not a geek!",54
S06E13 Rachels Sister.txt,Jill,"Fine, then let’s just say he’s not my type.",54
S06E13 Rachels Sister.txt,Rachel,What handsome is not your type? Smart? Kind? Good kisser? What those things aren’t on your list? Ross is a great guy! You would be lucky to be with him!,54
S06E13 Rachels Sister.txt,Jill,"Well okay, if it means that much to you, then I’ll ask him out.",54
S06E13 Rachels Sister.txt,Rachel,"Oh no-no-no, no-no-no, that’s not what I meant.",54
S06E13 Rachels Sister.txt,Jill,"No! Y’know what Rachel? You’re right, y’know he has been really nice to me.",54
S06E13 Rachels Sister.txt,Rachel,"Yeah but, he’s not your type.",54
S06E13 Rachels Sister.txt,Jill,"Yeah but maybe that’s a good thing. Y’know I’m doing all these different sorts of things, and maybe I should try dating a geek too!",54
S06E13 Rachels Sister.txt,Rachel,"Yeah but, you don’t, you don’t, you don’t want to try to much too fast. Y’know? I mean, you do remember what happened to the little girl that tried to much too fast don’t you?",54
S06E13 Rachels Sister.txt,Jill,What?,54
S06E13 Rachels Sister.txt,Rachel,She-she died Jill.,54
S06E13 Rachels Sister.txt,Chandler,"Oh Jeez honey, I thought, I thought you were asleep.",58
S06E13 Rachels Sister.txt,Monica,How could I be asleep knowing that you were in the next room.,58
S06E13 Rachels Sister.txt,Chandler,Would you please get some rest!,60
S06E13 Rachels Sister.txt,Gunther,You’re paying for that.,63

S02E20 Old Yeller Dies.txt,Rachel,Uh-huh.,25
S02E20 Old Yeller Dies.txt,Ross,"Yeah, that way I figure, ya know, we'll be far enough away from our parents that we don't have to see them all the time but close enough that they can come over and babysit whenever we want. And yes, I know, the taxes are a little higher than, let's say, Nassau county but the school system's supposedly great.",25

S02E20 Old Yeller Dies.txt,Richard,"Oh, no, honey, I mean, don't worry, I like hanging out with those guys. It's fun for me. They're different than my other friends, they don't start sentences with, 'You know who just died shoveling snow?'",28
S02E20 Old Yeller Dies.txt,Monica,"Alright that's great, then just go. Go Knicks.",28
S02E20 Old Yeller Dies.txt,Richard,"Uh, it's the college playoffs.",28

S02E20 Old Yeller Dies.txt,Monica,"Ok, then just go.",28
S02E20 Old Yeller Dies.txt,Monica,"Oh, why does this bother me so much? I mean I don't wanna be one of those people who tells their boyfriend they wanna spend 24 hours a day with them.",29
S02E20 Old Yeller Dies.txt,Phoebe,Sure.,29
S02E20 Old Yeller Dies.txt,Monica,"It's just that he doesn't have that much free time, ya know, and I don't know, what do I do?",29
S02E20 Old Yeller Dies.txt,Phoebe,Does it matter? You're ultimately just gonna die or get divorced or have to blow your pets head off.,29
S02E20 Old Yeller Dies.txt,Monica,I've got a question. Richard made plans again with the guys.,31
S02E20 Old Yeller Dies.txt,Rachel,"Yeah well, Ross just made plans for the whole century.",31
S02E20 Old Yeller Dies.txt,Monica,"Ya know what, I think I'm gonna go to my room and read Cosmo, maybe there's something helpful in there. Know what, at least maybe I can learn how to do an at home bikini wax with leftover Cristmas candles.",31
S02E20 Old Yeller Dies.txt,Rachel,"I don't know, you tell me. One minute I'm holding Ben like a football, the next thing I know, I've got two kids, I'm living in Scarsdale complaining about the taxes.",32
S02E20 Old Yeller Dies.txt,Ross,"Well I'm sorry, I think about stuff. Ya know, I mean, you're at work, you're assembling bones, your mind wanders.",32
S02E20 Old Yeller Dies.txt,Rachel,"Ross, you have planned out the next 20 years of our lives, we've been dating for six weeks.",32
S02E20 Old Yeller Dies.txt,Ross,"C'mon, what, you never think about our future?",32
S02E20 Old Yeller Dies.txt,Rachel,"Yes, but I, I think about who's apartment we're gonna sleep at tomorrow night and, and where we're gonna have dinner next Saturday night. I do not think about what our childrens' names are gonna be. You know what our childrens names are gonna be.",32
S02E20 Old Yeller Dies.txt,Ross,"No, no, I mean, ya know, I, I read a book and there was a girl named Emily and I thought, I thought that might be good.",32

S02E20 Old Yeller Dies.txt,Ross,Yeah.,32
S02E20 Old Yeller Dies.txt,Rachel,"But I do not want to have everything decided for me. I spent my whole life like that. It's what I had with Barry, that was one of the reasons I left. I, I like not knowing right now and I'm sorry if that scares you but if you want to be with me you are gonna have to deal with that.",32
S02E20 Old Yeller Dies.txt,Ross,Ok fine.,32
S02E20 Old Yeller Dies.txt,Rachel,Thank you.,32
S02E20 Old Yeller Dies.txt,Ross,We're not done.,32
S02E20 Old Yeller Dies.txt,Rachel,I didn't know that.,32
S02E20 Old Yeller Dies.txt,Ross,"Ok, then you're gonna have to understand that you're with a guy who's not gonna stop planning his future with you because he knows that we're gonna end up together and if that scares you, tough, 'cause you're gonna have to deal with that.",32
S02E20 Old Yeller Dies.txt,Rachel,"Fine, I will.",32
S02E20 Old Yeller Dies.txt,Ross,"Good, 'cause I love you.",32

S02E20 Old Yeller Dies.txt,Phoebe,Hey. Oh thanks for the great movie tip.,33
S02E20 Old Yeller Dies.txt,Monica,Did you like it?,33
S02E20 Old Yeller Dies.txt,Phoebe,"Oh yeah. You know, I don't know if I was happier when um George Bailey destroyed the family business or um, Donna Reid cried, or when the mean pharmacist made his ear bleed.",33
S02E20 Old Yeller Dies.txt,Monica,"Alright, I'll give you the ear thing but don't you think the ending was pretty wonderful?",33
S02E20 Old Yeller Dies.txt,Phoebe,"I didn't watch the ending, I was too depressed. It just kept getting worse and worse, it should have been called, ""It's a sucky life and just when you think it can't suck any more it does.""",33
S02E20 Old Yeller Dies.txt,Chandler,Kick save and... denied.,34
S02E20 Old Yeller Dies.txt,Richard,"But... he gets it back, pass to the middle, lines it up and... BAM! Yes! Could that shot BE any prettier?",34

S02E20 Old Yeller Dies.txt,Richard,"Well, we had a table in college.",34
S02E20 Old Yeller Dies.txt,Chandler,"Oh really, I didn't know they had foosball in the 1800's.",34

S02E20 Old Yeller Dies.txt,Richard,"Ok, just one more point.",35
S02E20 Old Yeller Dies.txt,Chandler,"See, that's why we don't let her play.",36
S02E20 Old Yeller Dies.txt,Richard,Is everything all right?,36
S02E20 Old Yeller Dies.txt,Monica,Um-hmm.,36
S02E20 Old Yeller Dies.txt,Richard,Uh-oh.,36

S07E01 Monicas Thunder.txt,Rachel,"I swear, I never wanted any part of your night!",87
S07E01 Monicas Thunder.txt,Monica,"Oh, is that why you did it the secret hallway where nobody ever goes?!",87
S07E01 Monicas Thunder.txt,Ross,"Uh, Rachel, I’ve been thinking. I don’t think us getting together tonight is such a good idea. I’m calling it off.",87
S07E01 Monicas Thunder.txt,Monica,"I don’t know! I don’t—maybe you’re feeling a little resentful. Maybe ah, maybe you thought you’d get married first! Maybe you can’t stand the fact that your formally fat friend is getting married before you!",89
S07E01 Monicas Thunder.txt,Rachel,"Oh wow. That—y’know what? That is so unfair. Y’know what? Now I want to steal your thunder! Come on Ross, let’s go have sex!",89

S07E01 Monicas Thunder.txt,Chandler,How is that ever going to happen?!,97

S07E01 Monicas Thunder.txt,Monica,Okay! Why?!,97
S07E01 Monicas Thunder.txt,Rachel,Because! Because I was sad.,97
S07E01 Monicas Thunder.txt,Monica,What do you mean?,97
S07E01 Monicas Thunder.txt,Rachel,"Look, I am so…so happy for you guys, but you getting married just reminds me of the fact that I’m not. I’m not even close. And I don’t know, maybe I just wanted to make myself feel better. And I know that that’s dumb, but oh my God you were so depressed when Ross got married that you slept with Chandler!",97
S07E01 Monicas Thunder.txt,Rachel,"Anyway sweetie, I am, I’m so sorry I ruined your night.",99

S05E01 Ross Says Rachel.txt,Rachel,"Oh yeah! Of course, I mean, she’s gonna get over this, y’know? I mean, so you said my name! Y’know you just said it ‘cause you saw me there, if you’d have seen a circus freak, you would’ve said, ""I take thee circus freak."" Y’know, it didn’t mean anything, it’s just a mistake. It didn’t mean anything. Right?",37
S05E01 Ross Says Rachel.txt,Ross,"No! No! Of course it didn’t mean anything! I mean, uh well, I can understand why Emily would think it meant something, y’know, because-because it was you…",37

S05E01 Ross Says Rachel.txt,Rachel,"Okay, Pheebs, y’know what, let’s look at this objectively all right? Ninth grade, right? The obsession starts. All right? The summer after ninth grade he sees me in a two-piece for the first time, his obsession begins to grow. So then…",50

S05E01 Ross Says Rachel.txt,Chandler,We have to leave for New York in an hour.,63
S05E01 Ross Says Rachel.txt,Monica,"I know, I’ve been looking at those doors, they look pretty sound proof, don’t you think?",63
S05E01 Ross Says Rachel.txt,Chandler,"We can’t do that that’s insane. I mean ‘A’ he could wake up and ‘B’ y’know, let’s go for it.",63
S05E01 Ross Says Rachel.txt,Ross,"Wait, well wh-wh-wh-where is she?",65
S05E01 Ross Says Rachel.txt,Monica,"Y’know, maybe it’s best that we never got to do it again.",70
S05E01 Ross Says Rachel.txt,Monica,"I’m gonna go to the bathroom, maybe I’ll see you there in a bit?",71
S05E01 Ross Says Rachel.txt,Chandler,‘Kay!,71
S05E01 Ross Says Rachel.txt,Joey,Can I ask you something?,72
S05E01 Ross Says Rachel.txt,Chandler,"Uhh, no.",72
S05E01 Ross Says Rachel.txt,Joey,"Felicity and I, we’re watching My Giant, and I was thinking, ""I’m never gonna be as good an actor as that giant."" Do you think I’m just wasting my life with this acting thing?",72
S05E01 Ross Says Rachel.txt,Chandler,No.,72
S05E01 Ross Says Rachel.txt,Joey,"I mean, the giant is like five years younger than me, y’know, you think I’ll ever get there?",72
S05E01 Ross Says Rachel.txt,Chandler,Yes.,72
S05E01 Ross Says Rachel.txt,Joey,Thanks man.,72
S05E01 Ross Says Rachel.txt,Joey,But what about how much taller he is than me?,73
S05E01 Ross Says Rachel.txt,Joey,"I mean, there’s no way I can make myself taller now, y’know? And who knows what science will come up with in the future, but Chandler, what if I die an unsuccessful, regular sized man?",74
S05E01 Ross Says Rachel.txt,Joey,"Hey, Monica, wow you’ve been in the bathroom for like a half-hour.",75

S05E01 Ross Says Rachel.txt,Joey,"All right, I’m gonna go say hi the chick and the duck.",78
S05E01 Ross Says Rachel.txt,Phoebe,"Oh, me too!",78
S05E01 Ross Says Rachel.txt,Joey,"Why would you need to say hi to them, you’ve been feeding them for four days?",78
S05E01 Ross Says Rachel.txt,Phoebe,"Oh right, maybe I’ll just go home.",78
S05E01 Ross Says Rachel.txt,Monica,"Well, we certainly are alone.",79
S05E01 Ross Says Rachel.txt,Chandler,"Yes! Good thing we have that, ‘Not in New York’ rule.",79
S05E01 Ross Says Rachel.txt,Monica,"Right. Umm, listen since we’re-we-re on that subject, umm, I just wanted to tell you that uh, well, I-I was going through a really hard time in London, what with my brother getting married and that guy thinking I was Ross’s mother…",79
S05E01 Ross Says Rachel.txt,Chandler,Right.,79
S05E01 Ross Says Rachel.txt,Monica,"Well, an-anyway, I just—that night meant a lot to me, I guess I’m just trying to say thanks.",79
S05E01 Ross Says Rachel.txt,Chandler,"Oh. Y’know, that night meant a lot to me too, and it wasn’t because I was in a bad place or anything, it just meant a lot to me ‘cause, you’re really hot! Is that okay?",79
S05E01 Ross Says Rachel.txt,Chandler,And I’m cute too.,80
S05E01 Ross Says Rachel.txt,Monica,And you’re cute too.,80

S05E01 Ross Says Rachel.txt,Rachel,"Ohh, so no sign of Emily huh?",86
S05E01 Ross Says Rachel.txt,Ross,Not yet.,86
S05E01 Ross Says Rachel.txt,Rachel,"So umm, what time are you supposed to leave?",86
S05E01 Ross Says Rachel.txt,Ross,Pretty soon I guess.,87
S05E01 Ross Says Rachel.txt,Rachel,Yeah. I’m sorry.,87
S05E01 Ross Says Rachel.txt,Ross,"I just, I don’t understand, I mean, how-how can she do this? Y’know, what, am I, am I like a complete idiot for thinking that she’d actually show up?",87
S05E01 Ross Says Rachel.txt,Rachel,"No, you’re not an idiot, Ross. You’re a guy very much in love.",87
S05E01 Ross Says Rachel.txt,Ross,Same difference.,87
S05E01 Ross Says Rachel.txt,Ross,"I get it! Well, that’s that.",88
S05E01 Ross Says Rachel.txt,Rachel,"No, you know what, I think you should go.",88
S05E01 Ross Says Rachel.txt,Ross,What?,88
S05E01 Ross Says Rachel.txt,Rachel,"Yeah, I do. I think you should go, by yourself, get some distance, clear your head, I think it’d be really good.",88
S05E01 Ross Says Rachel.txt,Ross,"Oh, I don’t, I don’t, I don’t know…",88
S05E01 Ross Says Rachel.txt,Rachel,"Oh, come on Ross! I think it would be really good for you!",88

S05E01 Ross Says Rachel.txt,Rachel,"What? Wait, what?",89
S05E01 Ross Says Rachel.txt,Ross,"Why don’t you come, I mean, I-I have two tickets, why not?",89
S05E01 Ross Says Rachel.txt,Rachel,"Well-well, I don’t know Ross—really?",89
S05E01 Ross Says Rachel.txt,Ross,"Yeah, yeah, it’ll be great! You can, you can lay on the beach and I can cry over my failed marriage. See-see how I make jokes?",89

S09E13 Monica Sings.txt,Ross,OK you...you really don't know what I am talking about?,2
S09E13 Monica Sings.txt,Chandler,No!,2
S09E13 Monica Sings.txt,Ross,OK! Last night after the party I saw Rachel kissing that jerk from her office out on your balcony.,2
S09E13 Monica Sings.txt,Chandler,Our balcony? Seriously? That's so funny because I told Monica we should put lights on our balcony. And she said,2
S09E13 Monica Sings.txt,Ross,"Right that's why I came over to talk about. Hum...I saw Rachel kissing some guy on your balcony,",2
S09E13 Monica Sings.txt,Chandler,So are you gonna...talk to her?,2
S09E13 Monica Sings.txt,Ross,"Why...Why should I? I mean if she wants to move on, that's fine!",2
S09E13 Monica Sings.txt,Chandler,"You know when ""That's fine"" sounds true when someone yells it and spits!",2
S09E13 Monica Sings.txt,Ross,No I'm serious. I mean she wants to date people? Fine! I don't care but...at least she could have told me. You know,2
S09E13 Monica Sings.txt,Chandler,No no no. Good. So you're moving on? Do you have any idea where you're moving?,2
S09E13 Monica Sings.txt,Ross,I don't know. I mean I have plenty of opportunity. Just just now there were some women at the coffee house smiled at me.,2
S09E13 Monica Sings.txt,Chandler,"Dude, don't rub my face in your crazy single life!",2
S09E13 Monica Sings.txt,Ross,"Well, and how about this? There is an anthropologist at school who totally came on to me during the inter-departmental",2

S09E13 Monica Sings.txt,Phoebe,On how far along he's in the sex change process!,4
S09E13 Monica Sings.txt,Monica,"No I totally disagree. No I think it's fine for a guy to do something like that. Such you an actor. Not that you need to,",4
S09E13 Monica Sings.txt,Joey,Ok! Stop it you guys! Stop staring! You're freaking me out!,4
S09E13 Monica Sings.txt,Phoebe,Your knuckles are kinda hairy too...,4
S09E13 Monica Sings.txt,Joey,Oh man! I have to get those done too?!,4

S09E13 Monica Sings.txt,Monica,Only if I don't have to get up and sing.,4
S09E13 Monica Sings.txt,Phoebe,"But everybody sings. It's so much fun! Last time this adorable old man got out there, forgot all of the words, flipped out",4
S09E13 Monica Sings.txt,Monica,"It's just, I'm not good at singing.",4
S09E13 Monica Sings.txt,Phoebe,Oh! What's the matter? Are you scared? You're afraid I'm a better singer? You're afraid I'm gonna beat you at singing?,4
S09E13 Monica Sings.txt,Monica,"No no, it's not working on me. Wow! I must be growing up!",4
S09E13 Monica Sings.txt,Phoebe,OK fine! Please come and support Mike. You don't have to sing.,4
S09E13 Monica Sings.txt,Monica,So I don't have to sing and I can just sit there and pass judgments on others?,4
S09E13 Monica Sings.txt,Phoebe,While drinking...,4
S09E13 Monica Sings.txt,Monica,I'm there!,4
S09E13 Monica Sings.txt,Rachel,Hi guys! Listen I really need your help. I think I did something really stupid.,4
S09E13 Monica Sings.txt,Phoebe,Well yes Rachel but you got something so beautiful out there,4

S09E13 Monica Sings.txt,Rachel,"Yeah. It was after the party, we were on the balcony and...",4
S09E13 Monica Sings.txt,Monica,Wait wait wait. I was at home the whole time. How did I missed that?,4
S09E13 Monica Sings.txt,Phoebe,"It was the end of the party, you were probably ironing wrapping paper.",4
S09E13 Monica Sings.txt,Monica,Oh yeah...So how did you end up kissing?,4
S09E13 Monica Sings.txt,Rachel,"You know we were all alone and he was being really nice to me and, oh and he gave me this scarf...",4
S09E13 Monica Sings.txt,Monica,I thought you hated him?,4
S09E13 Monica Sings.txt,Rachel,"You know honey, there is a thin line between love and hate, and it turns out that line...is a scarf!",4
S09E13 Monica Sings.txt,Monica,So are you thinking of starting up something with this guy?,4
S09E13 Monica Sings.txt,Rachel,"I don't know. It's so complicated. I work with this guy, you know, I have the baby, and I have Ross, and I just...I don't",4
S09E13 Monica Sings.txt,Monica,"Sounds like you need to think about what you want, talk to Gavin, and you definitely should talk to Ross",4
S09E13 Monica Sings.txt,Rachel,Or...I could call in sick and not deal with it at all...,4
S09E13 Monica Sings.txt,Phoebe,"Wow! Five-month maternity leave, you're back for four days, kiss a co-worker, call in sick, they are lucky to have you!!",4
S09E13 Monica Sings.txt,Joey,Hey. I'm here for my eyebrow appointment.,5

S09E13 Monica Sings.txt,Joey,Please I have an extremely high threshold...Holly Mother Of God! My face! My face!! I'm all right! I'm all right!,6
S09E13 Monica Sings.txt,Chandler,Hey it's the most eligible man in NY. How's the moving on going?,8
S09E13 Monica Sings.txt,Ross,Not well. I went on the subway again and someone did sit on my hand but that person was neither female nor wearing pants.,8
S09E13 Monica Sings.txt,Chandler,"Well maybe you're going about this the wrong way. You know I mean think about it. Single white male, divorced three times,",8
S09E13 Monica Sings.txt,Ross,That's funny...Do you think you'll ever work again?,8
S09E13 Monica Sings.txt,Chandler,What are doing? You know I can only dish it out!,8
S09E13 Monica Sings.txt,Ross,I can't believe Rachel just moved on and didn't say anything to me,8
S09E13 Monica Sings.txt,Chandler,"Maybe she didn't move on, you know...maybe that kiss was just an impulsive one-time birthday thing",8
S09E13 Monica Sings.txt,Ross,"No no, about a month ago she gave her number to some guy in a bar.",8
S09E13 Monica Sings.txt,Chandler,Did she go out with him?,8
S09E13 Monica Sings.txt,Ross,"No. When he called, I...I threw the message away.",8
S09E13 Monica Sings.txt,Chandler,Ah! The high road...,8
S09E13 Monica Sings.txt,Ross,You know what? Enough! Enough talking! I have to get moving! Hey check out those two blondes over there!,8
S09E13 Monica Sings.txt,Chandler,Are you trying to get everybody divorced?,8
S09E13 Monica Sings.txt,Ross,"You don't have to do anything. It will just be easier if it is the two of us, like college, remember? You...you break the",8
S09E13 Monica Sings.txt,Chandler,I thought I had to make the jokes!,8
S09E13 Monica Sings.txt,Ross,Don't you have to be at work?,8
S09E13 Monica Sings.txt,Chandler,"Oh come on! Hello! Hi! My name is Chandler, here's my friend Ross right here, and we were wondering you know if you're up for it.",8
S09E13 Monica Sings.txt,Ross,"Hum...So...hum...Oh hey I noticed you were reading the paper...another flood in Europe? Here�s a question: ""Would you...",8

S08E18 In Massapequa.txt,Rachel,So would I. You wouldn’t think that Annie Liebawitz would forget to put film in the camera.,29
S08E18 In Massapequa.txt,Rachel,What? I’m not you. This may be the only wedding I ever have. I want it to be amazing.,30
S08E18 In Massapequa.txt,Ross,"Okay, okay. Ooooh, ooh maybe I rode in on a Harley.",30
S08E18 In Massapequa.txt,Rachel,"Okay, Ross, it has to be realistic.",30
S08E18 In Massapequa.txt,Parker,Are you okay? You seem kind of quiet.,31
S08E18 In Massapequa.txt,Phoebe,"No, I’m fine. I’m great. I’m with you.",31
S08E18 In Massapequa.txt,Phoebe,"Hm huh, yeah.",32
S08E18 In Massapequa.txt,Parker,Ah! Oysters! Let me feed you one.,32
S08E18 In Massapequa.txt,Phoebe,"No, that’s not necessary.",32
S08E18 In Massapequa.txt,Parker,Please.,32
S08E18 In Massapequa.txt,Phoebe,"No, actually I don’t eat…",32
S08E18 In Massapequa.txt,Parker,I won’t quit until you try.,32
S08E18 In Massapequa.txt,Parker,What are they like? I’ve never had one.,33
S08E18 In Massapequa.txt,Phoebe,Why don’t you just try one?,33
S08E18 In Massapequa.txt,Parker,"No, they look too weird.",33
S08E18 In Massapequa.txt,Chandler,What are you doin’?,34
S08E18 In Massapequa.txt,Monica,Just going over my toast. Those two will never know what hit ‘em. I can’t wait. They’re going to be crying so hard. They’re going to be fighting for breath.,34
S08E18 In Massapequa.txt,Rachel,"And my veil was lace, made by blind, Belgium nuns.",36
S08E18 In Massapequa.txt,Woman,Blind?,36
S08E18 In Massapequa.txt,Rachel,"Well, not at first, but it was very intricate work and they said even though they lost their sight, it was all worth it.",36
S08E18 In Massapequa.txt,Rachel,"Well, I don’t know about that, but some said that I looked like a floating angel.",36
S08E18 In Massapequa.txt,Rachel,Oh yeah. That’s a great story.,37
S08E18 In Massapequa.txt,Ross,"Well, um, actually, I-I took her to the planetarium. That’s-that’s where we had our first date. Um, she walked in and I had the room filled with lilies, her favorite flower…",37
S08E18 In Massapequa.txt,Rachel,Shhh! I want to hear the rest!,37
S08E18 In Massapequa.txt,Ross,"Then, Fred Astaire singing The Way You Look Tonight came on the sound system, and the lights came down. And I got down on one knee and written across the dome in the stars were the words ""Will you marry me?""",37
S08E18 In Massapequa.txt,Joey,"Yeah uh, Phoebe! Look umm, I want to apologize about before, okay? We were being jerks. Parker’s a nice guy and I’d like to get to know him.",40
S08E18 In Massapequa.txt,Phoebe,Then you better do it now.,40
S08E18 In Massapequa.txt,Joey,Why?,40
S08E18 In Massapequa.txt,Phoebe,Because I’m going to kill him,40
S08E18 In Massapequa.txt,Joey,What-what?,40
S08E18 In Massapequa.txt,Phoebe,"You guys were right. He’s just too excited about…everything. I mean I’m all for living life, but this is the Geller’s 35th anniversary. Okay? Let’s call a spade a spade this party stinks.",40
S08E18 In Massapequa.txt,Joey,"I know I’m having the worst time. There was a 15-minute line for the buffet, and when I finally got up to the plates, I slipped on a giant booger!",40
S08E18 In Massapequa.txt,Phoebe,Are you sure it wasn’t an oyster?,40
S08E18 In Massapequa.txt,Joey,"I guess it could’ve been, I didn’t really look at it. Y’know, I just wiped it on Chandler’s coat and got the hell out of there.",40
S08E18 In Massapequa.txt,Phoebe,He’s just such a great guy I’m so excited about him.,40
S08E18 In Massapequa.txt,Joey,"Oh hey, you should be excited about him. There’s nothing wrong with him he’s a good guy.",40
S08E18 In Massapequa.txt,Phoebe,You think?,40
S08E18 In Massapequa.txt,Joey,Yeah. Ya know what I think; I think we were all just being too negative.,40
S08E18 In Massapequa.txt,Phoebe,"You’re right. You’re right, he’s just embracing life. We could all stand to be a little more like Parker. You know what? I am like him! I’m a sunny, positive person.",40
S08E18 In Massapequa.txt,Joey,"Actually, you have a little bit of an edge.",40
S08E18 In Massapequa.txt,Phoebe,What’s that now?,40
S08E18 In Massapequa.txt,Joey,Nothing…,40
S08E18 In Massapequa.txt,Phoebe,Oh look it’s Parker!,40
S08E18 In Massapequa.txt,Parker,Look! It’s the bunny hop!,40
S08E18 In Massapequa.txt,Phoebe,Oooh I love it!,40
S08E18 In Massapequa.txt,Parker,You do?!,40
S08E18 In Massapequa.txt,Phoebe,Are you kidding? People acting like animals to music. Come on!,40
S08E18 In Massapequa.txt,Monica,"Okay it’s time for the toast! Umm now-now, I know that Ross usually gives the toast, but this year I’m going to do it.",41
S08E18 In Massapequa.txt,Ross,"Oh, no, Mom, it’s just Monica this year.",44
S08E18 In Massapequa.txt,Parker,My God what a fantastically well lit hallway!,47
S08E18 In Massapequa.txt,Phoebe,Can I get you something to drink? Like a water and Valium?,47
S08E18 In Massapequa.txt,Parker,"I must say this apartment, its, its, There are no words…",47
S08E18 In Massapequa.txt,Phoebe,Oh thank God.,47
S08E18 In Massapequa.txt,Parker,It’s a haven. A third-floor paradise. A modern-day Eden in the midst…,47
S08E18 In Massapequa.txt,Phoebe,"Yeah? I know! I know! Uh huh? Listen why don’t we just um, sit and relax? You know just be with each other. Quietly!",47
S08E18 In Massapequa.txt,Phoebe,"Let’s try something else, let’s play a game.",48
S08E18 In Massapequa.txt,Parker,I love games!,48
S08E18 In Massapequa.txt,Parker,Or…Jenga.,49
S08E18 In Massapequa.txt,Phoebe,"But, let’s play this one first. And remember whoever talks first loses!",49
S08E18 In Massapequa.txt,Parker,"I lose, now Jenga.",50
S08E18 In Massapequa.txt,Phoebe,Oh my God! Oh my God!,50
S08E18 In Massapequa.txt,Parker,Is something wrong?,50
S08E18 In Massapequa.txt,Phoebe,"Wrong? Really? You know the word wrong. Everything isn’t perfect? Everything isn’t magical? Everything isn’t a glow with the light of a million fairies? They were just brake lights, Parker!",50
S08E18 In Massapequa.txt,Parker,"Well, excuse me for putting a good spin on a traffic jam!",50
S08E18 In Massapequa.txt,Phoebe,You don’t have to put a good spin on everything.,50
S08E18 In Massapequa.txt,Parker,I’m sorry that’s who I am. I’m a positive person.,50
S08E18 In Massapequa.txt,Phoebe,"No! I am a positive person. You are like Santa Clause on Prozac, at Disneyland, getting laid!",50
S08E18 In Massapequa.txt,Parker,"So what do you want me to do, you want me to be more negative, less happy?",50
S08E18 In Massapequa.txt,Phoebe,Much less happy!,50
S08E18 In Massapequa.txt,Parker,"Fine! Well then to quote Ross, ""I’d better be going.""",50
S08E18 In Massapequa.txt,Parker,Isn’t this the most incredible fight you’ve ever had in your entire life?,52
S08E18 In Massapequa.txt,Ross,"…and then, we could’ve gone from the ceremony to the reception with you in the sidecar!",54
S08E18 In Massapequa.txt,Rachel,"Ross, it just wouldn’t have been feasible.",54
S08E18 In Massapequa.txt,Ross,But having a dove place the ring on your finger would’ve been no problem?,54
S08E18 In Massapequa.txt,Rachel,It was really fun being married to you tonight.,54
S08E18 In Massapequa.txt,Ross,"Yeah! And! And, it was the easiest 400 bucks I’ve ever made.",54
S08E18 In Massapequa.txt,Rachel,"Okay Ross, can I uh, can I ask you something?",54
S08E18 In Massapequa.txt,Ross,Yeah.,54
S08E18 In Massapequa.txt,Rachel,"That proposal, at the planetarium…",54
S08E18 In Massapequa.txt,Ross,"I know, I know it was stupid.",54
S08E18 In Massapequa.txt,Rachel,"Are you kidding?! With the, with the lilies, and-and the song, and the stars! It was…really wonderful! Did you just make that up?",54
S08E18 In Massapequa.txt,Ross,"No, actually I thought about it when, when we were going out. It’s how I imagined I uh, I would ask you to marry me.",54
S08E18 In Massapequa.txt,Rachel,"Well, that would’ve been very hard to say no too.",54
S08E18 In Massapequa.txt,Rachel,Goodnight,55
S08E18 In Massapequa.txt,Ross,Even if the sidecar had a windscreen so your hair wouldn’t get messed up?,56
S08E18 In Massapequa.txt,Rachel,I will think about it.,56
S08E18 In Massapequa.txt,Ross,That’s all I’m askin’,56
S08E18 In Massapequa.txt,Monica,"Okay that’s it. I give up. At mom and dad’s 40th anniversary, you’re the one giving the speech.",57
S08E18 In Massapequa.txt,Ross,Y’know I don’t understand why they didn’t cry. It was a beautiful speech.,57
S08E18 In Massapequa.txt,Monica,"Oh, come on.",57
S08E18 In Massapequa.txt,Ross,"Hey! All that stuff you said about true love, you were right, I mean, we did learn a lot from Mom and Dad! And that picture of Chi-Chi with her mischievous grin. And what you said about Nana. Ohh, yeah she really would’ve wanted to be there. And you know what? I think she was.",57
S05E05 The Kips.txt,Joey,Monica? What time is it?,5
S05E05 The Kips.txt,Joey,But it's dark out.,6
S05E05 The Kips.txt,Monica,"Well that's because you always sleep to noon, silly! This is what 9 looks like.",6
S05E05 The Kips.txt,Monica,I'm really getting tired of sneaking around.,7
S05E05 The Kips.txt,Chandler,"I know, me too. Hey! Y'know what if we went away for a whole weekend? Y'know we'd have no interruptions and we could be naked the entire time.",7
S05E05 The Kips.txt,Monica,All weekend? That's a whole lotta naked.,7
S05E05 The Kips.txt,Chandler,"Yeah, I can say that I have a conference and you can say you have a chef thing.",7
S05E05 The Kips.txt,Monica,"Ohh, I've always wanted to go to this culinary fair that they have in Jersey!",7
S05E05 The Kips.txt,Monica,Wait! What about Joey?,8
S05E05 The Kips.txt,Phoebe,"Oh weird, Chandler just told us he's got a conference there!",11
S05E05 The Kips.txt,Monica,"Oh now that-that-that's funny, it seems like Chandler's conference could've been in Connecticut or Vermont.",11
S05E05 The Kips.txt,Chandler,I'm not in charge of where the conference is held. Do you want people to think it's a fake conference? It's a real conference.,11
S05E05 The Kips.txt,Joey,Hey!,12
S05E05 The Kips.txt,Monica,Hey.,12
S05E05 The Kips.txt,Ross,Is Rachel here? I gotta talk to her.,12
S05E05 The Kips.txt,Monica,"No, she's out shopping.",12
S05E05 The Kips.txt,Ross,Damn!,12
S05E05 The Kips.txt,Chandler,What's going on?,12
S05E05 The Kips.txt,Ross,"I told Emily to come. And I just need to y'know, talk to Rachel about it.",12
S05E05 The Kips.txt,Phoebe,"Wait a minute! So when Emily comes you're just, you're not gonna see Rachel anymore?",12
S05E05 The Kips.txt,Monica,"Wow, so you guys are, you're never gonna be in the same room together? How is that even gonna work?",13
S05E05 The Kips.txt,Ross,I have no idea. I mean… But-but I assure you I will figure it out.,13
S05E05 The Kips.txt,Joey,"Doesn’t seem like it's going to work, I mean…",14
S05E05 The Kips.txt,Joey,Hi!,15
S05E05 The Kips.txt,Chandler,"Uh, hey!",15
S05E05 The Kips.txt,Rachel,What's going on?,15
S05E05 The Kips.txt,Chandler,We're flipping Monica's mattress.,15
S05E05 The Kips.txt,Joey,"So I'm thinking, basically we pick it up and then we flip it.",15
S05E05 The Kips.txt,Phoebe,Yeah that's better than my way.,15
S05E05 The Kips.txt,Rachel,"Oh okay, hey guys, would you flip mine too?",16
S05E05 The Kips.txt,Ross,"So, Rach, y'know-y'know how Emily's coming right?",18
S05E05 The Kips.txt,Rachel,Oh yeah! I know.,18
S05E05 The Kips.txt,Chandler,"Oh yes, somebody just said, ""Can you hear anything?""",20
S05E05 The Kips.txt,Monica,"Hey, Joey's ass! What are you doing?",21
S05E05 The Kips.txt,Monica,"Ooh, candy bars, crossword puzzles…",22
S05E05 The Kips.txt,Chandler,Condoms?,23
S05E05 The Kips.txt,Joey,You don't know how long we're gonna be in here! We may have to repopulate the Earth.,23
S05E05 The Kips.txt,Chandler,And condoms are the way to do that?,23
S05E05 The Kips.txt,Ross,"Anyway it-it kinda-it all boils down to this, the last time I talked to Emily…",24
S05E05 The Kips.txt,Ross,What?!,25
S05E05 The Kips.txt,Rachel,"Oh my God, Le Poo, our dog!",25
S05E05 The Kips.txt,Ross,Le Poo's still alive?!,25
S05E05 The Kips.txt,Monica,"Sweetie, we heard you crying. Please don't cry.",26
S05E05 The Kips.txt,Rachel,It's Le Poo.,26
S05E05 The Kips.txt,Phoebe,"I know it's le poo right now, but it'll get better.",26
S05E05 The Kips.txt,Monica,"Ooh, chocolates on the pillows! I love that!",28
S05E05 The Kips.txt,Chandler,"Oh, you should live with Joey, Roll-os everywhere.",28
S05E05 The Kips.txt,Chandler,"Oh yes! Monica, get in here! There's a high-speed car chase on!",30
S05E05 The Kips.txt,Monica,We're switching rooms.,31
S05E05 The Kips.txt,Ross,"Hey, so uh, y'know how there's something I wanted to talk to you about?",35
S05E05 The Kips.txt,Rachel,What?,37
S05E05 The Kips.txt,Ross,You're nose is bleeding!,37
S05E05 The Kips.txt,Rachel,Sorry. Sorry.,39
S05E05 The Kips.txt,Ross,"Okay, I uh, I can't see you anymore.",39
S05E05 The Kips.txt,Rachel,"Yeah, I know. It's ridiculous! I can't see you either.",39
S05E05 The Kips.txt,Chandler,Half a tank? We still got a lot of high-speed chasing to do!,42
S05E05 The Kips.txt,Monica,We're switching rooms again.,42
S05E05 The Kips.txt,Chandler,What? Why?,42
S05E05 The Kips.txt,Monica,"This is a garden view room, and we paid for an ocean view room.",42
S05E05 The Kips.txt,Monica,Chandler!,44
S05E05 The Kips.txt,Monica,"Look, these clowns are trying to take us for a ride and I'm not gonna let 'em! And we're not a couple of suckers!",45
S05E05 The Kips.txt,Monica,"Okay, this one I like!",47
S05E05 The Kips.txt,Monica,Can we turn the TV off? Okay? Do we really want to spend the entire weekend like this?,48
S05E05 The Kips.txt,Chandler,"Oh, I'm sorry, am I getting in the way of all the room switching fun?",48
S05E05 The Kips.txt,Monica,"Hey, don't blame me for wigging tonight!",48
S05E05 The Kips.txt,Chandler,"Oh, who should I blame? The nice bell man who had to drag out luggage to 10 different rooms?",48
S05E05 The Kips.txt,Monica,"I don't know, how about the idiot who thought he could drive from Albany to Canada on a half a tank of gas!",48
S05E05 The Kips.txt,Chandler,Do not speak ill of the dead.,48
S05E05 The Kips.txt,Monica,"We're supposed to uh, be spending a romantic weekend together, it-it, what is the matter with you?",48
S05E05 The Kips.txt,Chandler,"I just want to watch a little television. What is the big deal? Geez, relax mom.",48
S05E05 The Kips.txt,Monica,What did you say?,48
S05E05 The Kips.txt,Chandler,"I said, ""Geez, relax Monnnnn.""",48
S05E05 The Kips.txt,Rachel,Hi!,49
S05E05 The Kips.txt,Ross,"Hey. Rachel, I-I-I've been wanting to tell you something for a while now and I really, I just have to get it out.",49
S05E05 The Kips.txt,Rachel,"Okay, what's up?",49
S05E05 The Kips.txt,Ross,"Okay, y'know how you told me I should do whatever it takes to fix my marriage?",49
S05E05 The Kips.txt,Rachel,"Yeah, I told you to give Emily whatever she wants.",49
S05E05 The Kips.txt,Ross,"And while that was good advice, you should know that what-what she wants…",49
S05E05 The Kips.txt,Rachel,Yeah?,49
S05E05 The Kips.txt,Ross,…is for me not to see you anymore.,49
S05E05 The Kips.txt,Ross,"It's awful I know, I mean, I feel terrible but I have to do this if I want my marriage to work. And I do, I have to make this marriage work. I have too. But the good thing is we can still see each other until she gets here.",50
S05E05 The Kips.txt,Rachel,"Ohh! Lucky me! Oh my God! That is good news, Ross! I think that's the best news I've heard since Le Poo died!",50
S05E05 The Kips.txt,Ross,You have no idea what a nightmare this has been. This is so hard.,50
S05E05 The Kips.txt,Rachel,"Oh yeah, really? Is it Ross? Yeah? Okay, well let me make this a just a little bit easier for you.",50
S05E05 The Kips.txt,Ross,What are you doing?,50
S05E05 The Kips.txt,Rachel,Storming out!,50
S05E05 The Kips.txt,Ross,"Rachel, this is your apartment.",50

S05E05 The Kips.txt,Joey,"Oh, so your weekend was a total bust?",52
S05E05 The Kips.txt,Chandler,"Uh, no, I got to see Donald Trump waiting for an elevator.",52
S05E05 The Kips.txt,Joey,"Hey, you're back too!",53
S05E05 The Kips.txt,Monica,"Yeah. Umm, Chandler can I talk to you outside for a second?",53
S05E05 The Kips.txt,Joey,"Hey, how was your chef thing?",53
S05E05 The Kips.txt,Chandler,"Well, maybe it was the kind of food that tasted good at first but then made everybody vomit and have diarrhea.",54
S05E05 The Kips.txt,Monica,"Okay, I'd like to know how much the room was because I'd like to pay my half.",57
S05E05 The Kips.txt,Chandler,"Okay, fine, $300.",57
S05E05 The Kips.txt,Monica,300 dollars?!,57
S05E05 The Kips.txt,Chandler,"Yeah, just think of it as $25 per room!",57
S05E05 The Kips.txt,Monica,Urghh!!,57
S05E05 The Kips.txt,Monica,Chandler stole a twenty from my purse!,58
S05E05 The Kips.txt,Joey,"Nooooo!!! Y'know what? Now that I think about it, I constantly find myself without twenties and you always have lots!",58
S05E05 The Kips.txt,Ross,You should've seen the look on her face. I don't want Rachel to hate me! I don't know what to do.,59
S05E05 The Kips.txt,Joey,You want my advice?,59
S05E05 The Kips.txt,Ross,Yes! Please!,59
S05E05 The Kips.txt,Joey,You're not gonna like it.,59
S05E05 The Kips.txt,Ross,That's okay.,59
S05E05 The Kips.txt,Joey,You got married to fast.,59
S05E05 The Kips.txt,Ross,That's not advice!,59
S05E05 The Kips.txt,Joey,I told ya.,59
S05E05 The Kips.txt,Joey,"Man, if anyone asked me to give up any of you, I couldn't do it.",60
S05E05 The Kips.txt,Monica,Maybe I could do it.,60
S05E05 The Kips.txt,Joey,"Hi, Rach.",61
S05E05 The Kips.txt,Chandler,Hi!,61
S05E05 The Kips.txt,Phoebe,Hey.,61
S05E05 The Kips.txt,Monica,Hey.,61
S05E05 The Kips.txt,Rachel,"Look, I know you guys heard about the whole thing with me and Ross but y'know, I've been obsessing about it all day and I'd just love not to talk about it. All right?",61
S05E05 The Kips.txt,Rachel,That's not Ross!,62
S05E05 The Kips.txt,Phoebe,Oh no! Not that guy! He does look like him though.,62
S05E05 The Kips.txt,Chandler,"Okay, Ross is in the bathroom.",62
S05E05 The Kips.txt,Rachel,"Oh my God, its happening. It's already started. I'm Kip.",62
S05E05 The Kips.txt,Joey,"Hey, you're not Kip!",62
S05E05 The Kips.txt,Chandler,"Kip, my old roommate, y'know we all used to hang out together.",64
S05E05 The Kips.txt,Joey,"Oh, that poor bastard.",64
S05E05 The Kips.txt,Rachel,"See? Yeah, you told me the story. He and Monica dated when they broke up they couldn't even be in the same room together and you all promised that you would stay his friend and what happened? He got phased out!",64
S05E05 The Kips.txt,Monica,You're not gonna be phased out!,64
S05E05 The Kips.txt,Phoebe,Ehh!!,65
S05E05 The Kips.txt,Rachel,"Honey, come on! You live far away! You're not related. You lift right out.",65
S05E05 The Kips.txt,Joey,"Hey, Mr. Bing. That uh, hotel you stayed at called. Said someone left an eyelash curler in your room.",67
S05E05 The Kips.txt,Chandler,Yes that was mine.,67
S05E05 The Kips.txt,Joey,'Cause I figured you'd hooked up with some girl and she'd left it there.,67
S05E05 The Kips.txt,Chandler,Yes that would have made more sense.,67
S05E05 The Kips.txt,Phoebe,Come where?,70
S05E05 The Kips.txt,Rachel,"Wherever I go. Come on you and me, we'll-we'll start a new group, we're the best ones.",70
S05E05 The Kips.txt,Phoebe,"Okay, but try and get Joey too.",70
S05E05 The Kips.txt,Ross,Hi.,72
S05E05 The Kips.txt,Rachel,Hi. What are you doing here? Isn't this against the rules?,72
S05E05 The Kips.txt,Ross,"I talked to Monica, look, I'm the one who made the choice. I'm the one who's making things change, so I should be the one to y'know, step back.",72
S05E05 The Kips.txt,Rachel,"Oh, Ross…",72
S05E05 The Kips.txt,Ross,"No, no, it's okay. Really. They're plenty of people who just see their sisters at Thanksgiving and just see their college roommates at reunions and just see Joey at Burger King. So is, is that better?",72
S05E05 The Kips.txt,Rachel,"No, it's not better. I still don't get to see you.",72
S05E05 The Kips.txt,Ross,"Well, what-what would you do? Rach, if you were me, what-what would you do?",72
S05E05 The Kips.txt,Rachel,"Well, for starters I would've said the right name at my wedding!",72
S05E05 The Kips.txt,Ross,I can't believe this is happening.,72
S05E05 The Kips.txt,Rachel,I know.,72
S05E05 The Kips.txt,Ross,I am so sorry.,72
S05E05 The Kips.txt,Rachel,I know that too.,72
S05E05 The Kips.txt,Monica,Hi.,75
S05E05 The Kips.txt,Chandler,"I just came over to drop off…nothing. So that weekend kinda sucked, huh?",75
S05E05 The Kips.txt,Monica,"Yeah, it did.",75
S05E05 The Kips.txt,Chandler,"So, I guess this is over.",75
S05E05 The Kips.txt,Monica,What?,75

S06E08 Rosss Teeth.txt,Monica,"Well, I think I shouldn’t look directly at them.",30
S06E08 Rosss Teeth.txt,Ross,"Come on, seriously.",30

S06E08 Rosss Teeth.txt,Monica,Oh my god.,34
S06E08 Rosss Teeth.txt,Rachel,"Yeah I know. She ran into him at my office and they just…made out. And the craziest thing is, now my boss likes me because I told her about it and she said it was the best gossip she’d heard all year.",34
S06E08 Rosss Teeth.txt,Chandler,I am proud of all my friends today.,34
S06E08 Rosss Teeth.txt,Chandler,"Hi, I’m Chandler. Your live-in boy",35
S06E08 Rosss Teeth.txt,Phoebe,That’s not Ralph Lauren. Sounds like him though.,39
S06E08 Rosss Teeth.txt,Rachel,What?,39
S06E08 Rosss Teeth.txt,Phoebe,"Yeah, no, Ralph doesn’t look anything like that guy. He’s-he’s young and he’s got long hair and a beard and a hacky sack.",39
S06E08 Rosss Teeth.txt,Rachel,"Oh My God, Phoebe, that’s not Ralph Lauren. That’s Kenny the copy guy.",39
S06E08 Rosss Teeth.txt,Phoebe,What?,39
S06E08 Rosss Teeth.txt,Rachel,"Oh..Go..Oh..and I told my boss that someone made out with Ralph Lauren. If she finds out that I lied to her, she is going to hate me even more. Phoebe!!",39
S06E08 Rosss Teeth.txt,Phoebe,Why would the copy guy say he was Ralph Lauren?,39
S06E08 Rosss Teeth.txt,Rachel,To get you to make out with him!!!,39
S06E08 Rosss Teeth.txt,Phoebe,Ohhh.,39
S06E08 Rosss Teeth.txt,Ross,I don’t know what I’m going to do. That date starts in like an hour.,41
S06E08 Rosss Teeth.txt,Monica,"Hey Ross, maybe if your skin was lighter. Your teeth wouldn’t look so bright.",41
S06E08 Rosss Teeth.txt,Ross,Oh great. So all I need to do is get some new skin. Thank you.,41
S06E08 Rosss Teeth.txt,Monica,"I’m just saying, if we put just a little bit of makeup on you.",41
S06E08 Rosss Teeth.txt,Ross,Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. We’re not 13 anymore.,41
S06E08 Rosss Teeth.txt,Monica,Ross this is the only thing left that has a shot at working.,41
S06E08 Rosss Teeth.txt,Ross,"But, won’t she notice I have makeup on?",41
S06E08 Rosss Teeth.txt,Monica,Please. Half the guys out there have makeup on.,41
S06E08 Rosss Teeth.txt,Ross,What??,41
S06E08 Rosss Teeth.txt,Monica,"All right, half the people. I mean, just try it and see.",41
S06E08 Rosss Teeth.txt,Monica,Now are drawers will smell nice and we didn’t waste these pantyhose.,44
S06E08 Rosss Teeth.txt,Chandler,"Yes, God forbid we throw out old underwear. You-you know what? I’m going to go over to Joey’s.",44
S06E08 Rosss Teeth.txt,Monica,"Wait, we’re supposed to organize the wrapping paper drawer.",44
S06E08 Rosss Teeth.txt,Chandler,"Yes, but I feel like I’ve really gotten in touch with my feminine side enough today. You know. In fact I think we’re two sachets away from becoming a lesbian couple.",44
S06E08 Rosss Teeth.txt,Monica,"You know what? This has been kind of a girlie day. You’re right, I’m sorry.",44
S06E08 Rosss Teeth.txt,Chandler,"Nah, Nah, it’s okay. I feel like I need to be in guy place. You know, do kind of like a man thing.",44
S06E08 Rosss Teeth.txt,Monica,Yeah. Go over to Joey’s. Go over to Joey’s and drink some beer and hammer up some drywall.,44
S06E08 Rosss Teeth.txt,Chandler,You know when guys hang out they don’t just drink some beer and hammer up drywall?,44
S06E08 Rosss Teeth.txt,Joey,Hey Chandler. Come on in. We’re knitting pot holders.,46
S06E08 Rosss Teeth.txt,Chandler,"No thanks, Josephine.",46
S06E08 Rosss Teeth.txt,Chandler,"Hey Ross, I was wondering if… Oh my God!! Where are all the men???",47
S06E08 Rosss Teeth.txt,Rachel,"Ohh, hi, Kim.",48
S06E08 Rosss Teeth.txt,Kim,Hi Rachel.,48
S06E08 Rosss Teeth.txt,Rachel,"Yeah, remember that thing I told you that happened yesterday? Well it didn’t happen.",48
S06E08 Rosss Teeth.txt,Kim,You didn’t cancel the fabric order from Taiwan?,48
S06E08 Rosss Teeth.txt,Rachel,"Okay, two things didn’t happen. Remember I told you that someone made out with Ralph Lauren in the copy room? Well, it turns out that’s not true.",48
S06E08 Rosss Teeth.txt,Kim,That’s not true?,48
S06E08 Rosss Teeth.txt,Rachel,No.,48
S06E08 Rosss Teeth.txt,Kim,"Oh that’s interesting? Because I checked and only one keycard was used to access the copy machine yesterday during lunch and that keycard belonged to you, Rachel.",48
S06E08 Rosss Teeth.txt,Rachel,"Oh no, no, no. Oh God, you think I made out with him.",48
S06E08 Rosss Teeth.txt,Kim,Listen to me. If you think sleeping with Ralph is going to get you my job. You are sadly mistaken.,48
S06E08 Rosss Teeth.txt,Kim,Hi Ralph.,49
S06E08 Rosss Teeth.txt,Kim,"Yeah, nothing happen. You could cut the sexual tension in here with a knife.",50
S06E08 Rosss Teeth.txt,Hillary,"And after that, what could I do except become a chef.",51
S06E08 Rosss Teeth.txt,Ross,Mmm-Hmm.,51
S06E08 Rosss Teeth.txt,Hillary,"And someday soon, I hope to open my own restaurant.",51
S06E08 Rosss Teeth.txt,Ross,Mmm.,51
S06E08 Rosss Teeth.txt,Hillary,"You know, you’re a really great listener. Most guys I go out with, they just talk and talk.",51
S06E08 Rosss Teeth.txt,Ross,Mm-Hmm.,51
S06E08 Rosss Teeth.txt,Hillary,"After a while it’s like, shut your mouth, you know?",51
S06E08 Rosss Teeth.txt,Hillary,I’ve probably been talking too much. Why don’t we talk about you a little bit?,52
S06E08 Rosss Teeth.txt,Ross,Mmm-Unmm.,52
S06E08 Rosss Teeth.txt,Hillary,Come on. I want to know.,52
S06E08 Rosss Teeth.txt,Joey,"So what’s really neat. If you sear the stems of the flowers first in a frying pan, your arrangement will look fresh much longer.",54
S06E08 Rosss Teeth.txt,Monica,"Oh my God, Joey, that is such a great tip.",54
S06E08 Rosss Teeth.txt,Chandler,"Monica, could you excuse us for a second? I need to talk to the girl with the flowers.",54
S06E08 Rosss Teeth.txt,Monica,"Okay. Oh but Joey, come over later because I’m going to teach you to make a bird feeder out of just a pine cone and some peanut butter.",54
S06E08 Rosss Teeth.txt,Chandler,What is the matter with you ?!?,55
S06E08 Rosss Teeth.txt,Joey,What?,55
S06E08 Rosss Teeth.txt,Joey,"Hey. Hey look I am still Joey, okay. Flowers they’re just, you know, they’re nice to look at. And that happens to be a picture by a famous artist. Of a famous baby.",56
S06E08 Rosss Teeth.txt,Chandler,You’re turning into a women.,56
S06E08 Rosss Teeth.txt,Joey,No I’m not. Why would you say that? That’s just mean.,56
S06E08 Rosss Teeth.txt,Chandler,Now I’ve upset you? What did I say?,56
S06E08 Rosss Teeth.txt,Joey,"It’s not what you said. It’s the way you said it….Oh My God, I’m a women!!!",56
S06E08 Rosss Teeth.txt,Rachel,"Now, she thinks that I made out with him and I did it to get her job.",57
S06E08 Rosss Teeth.txt,Phoebe,But why didn’t you just tell her the truth.,57
S06E08 Rosss Teeth.txt,Rachel,I did but she doesn’t think anyone would be stupid enough to confuse Kenny the copy guy with Ralph Lauren.,57
S06E08 Rosss Teeth.txt,Phoebe,"Well, hey, what if Kenny were the real brains behind the whole company? You know. What if Kenny hired that Ralph Lauren guy to be the pretty front man? Huh, did she ever think of that?",57
S06E08 Rosss Teeth.txt,Rachel,"You were with Kenny today, weren’t you?",57
S06E08 Rosss Teeth.txt,Phoebe,Just for a second.,57
S06E08 Rosss Teeth.txt,Rachel,"Ohh, Phoebe, what am I going to do?",57
S06E08 Rosss Teeth.txt,Phoebe,"Well, the only thing you can do. Sleep with Ralph Lauren.",57
S06E08 Rosss Teeth.txt,Rachel,"I’m not going to sleep with Ralph Lauren. I mean, I could, but I wouldn’t.",57
S06E08 Rosss Teeth.txt,Phoebe,"Ohh, sleep with Kenny.",57
S06E08 Rosss Teeth.txt,Rachel,That wouldn’t help me.,57
S06E08 Rosss Teeth.txt,Phoebe,"Ohh, yes it would.",57
S06E08 Rosss Teeth.txt,Hillary,I’ve had a really good time tonight.,58
S06E08 Rosss Teeth.txt,Ross,Mmm.,58
S06E08 Rosss Teeth.txt,Hillary,"You know, I rarely connect with someone this much on the first date.",58
S06E08 Rosss Teeth.txt,Hillary,Are you going to eat that bread?,59
S06E08 Rosss Teeth.txt,Ross,Hmm-Hmm.,61
S06E08 Rosss Teeth.txt,Hillary,Would you like to move over to the couch?,61
S06E08 Rosss Teeth.txt,Hillary,Maybe I’ll just turn the lights down a little.,62
S06E08 Rosss Teeth.txt,Hillary,Are those your teeth??,65
S06E08 Rosss Teeth.txt,Ross,"Ohh, you can see them, huh?",65
S06E08 Rosss Teeth.txt,Hillary,Yes. They’re insanely white.,65
S06E08 Rosss Teeth.txt,Ross,"I-I, did that for you.",65
S06E08 Rosss Teeth.txt,Hillary,What’s a matter with you?,65
S06E08 Rosss Teeth.txt,Ross,What’s a matter with me? You’ve got a black light. It’s 1999!,65
S06E08 Rosss Teeth.txt,Rachel,"Kim, hi.",66
S06E08 Rosss Teeth.txt,Kim,"Hi Rachel. Ohh, I’ve been meaning to ask you. Have you seen the new Ralph Lauren sheets? Ohh, what am I thinking. Of course you have.",66
S06E08 Rosss Teeth.txt,Rachel,Okay..Okay.. Look. I’m sorry that I lied to you before. You were right. Ralph and I were an item but were not anymore.,66
S06E08 Rosss Teeth.txt,Kim,"Oh, really?",66
S06E08 Rosss Teeth.txt,Kim,Oh my God. He just gave you the coldest look I have ever seen. It’s like he hates you. Then it is true.,69
S06E08 Rosss Teeth.txt,Rachel,Of course it’s true and it hurts so bad.,69
S06E08 Rosss Teeth.txt,Rachel,You and Ralph?,70
S06E08 Rosss Teeth.txt,Kim,Kenny the copyboy.,70
S06E08 Rosss Teeth.txt,Janine,Hey.,71
S06E08 Rosss Teeth.txt,Joey,"Hey, uhh, I need to talk to you.",71
S06E08 Rosss Teeth.txt,Janine,What’s the matter? Are you upset?,71
S06E08 Rosss Teeth.txt,Joey,"I’m sorry but we’ve got to get rid of all this girlie stuff in here. I, uh, I got to be a man! Okay. The living room has to remain a guy place, okay? That’s just the way it has to be.",71
S06E08 Rosss Teeth.txt,Janine,"Well, if that’s what you want. I’ll just put it all in my room.",71
S06E08 Rosss Teeth.txt,Janine,Okay.,72

S06E17 Unagi.txt,Chandler,I see where you’re goin’!,3
S06E17 Unagi.txt,Ross,What’s up with the greed Joe?,3
S06E17 Unagi.txt,Ross,"Well isn’t there something you can do to earn a little extra money? I mean, can’t-can’t you pick up, I don’t know, an extra shift here?",4
S06E17 Unagi.txt,Ross,"Oh, wait! Wait! Don’t you have an audition today? Yeah! Maybe you’ll get that job!",5

S02E05 Five Steaks And An Eggplant.txt,Joey,And we don't work hard?,24
S02E05 Five Steaks And An Eggplant.txt,Chandler,I'm just saying that sometimes we like to do stuff that costs a little more.,25
S02E05 Five Steaks And An Eggplant.txt,Joey,And you feel like we hold you back.,25
S02E05 Five Steaks And An Eggplant.txt,Chandler,Yes.,25

S02E05 Five Steaks And An Eggplant.txt,Monica,"Leon, Leon. Shhh! Guys. Wait, I don't understand. Those steaks were just a gift from the meat vendor. That was not a kick back. I'll just replace them and we can forget the whole thing. What corporate policy? No. Yeah. All right. I just got fired.",25
S02E05 Five Steaks And An Eggplant.txt,Phoebe,Oh.,25

S09E22 The Donor.txt,Rachel,Yeah...,6
S09E22 The Donor.txt,Joey,Maybe you could take Charlie shopping.,6
S09E22 The Donor.txt,Rachel,"Oh, well...",6
S09E22 The Donor.txt,Charlie,I'm sure you have better things to do.,6
S09E22 The Donor.txt,Joey,"Are you kidding? Rachel loves to shop! And she has great taste! Yeah, she's the one who taught me, you don't wear white after labour day and that you always, always, always have to put on underwear when you're trying on clothes.",6

S09E22 The Donor.txt,Rachel,"Which you're not, because you've totally hung up on him!",8
S09E22 The Donor.txt,Phoebe,Exactly!,8
S09E22 The Donor.txt,Rachel,And you're gonna want him to eat his heart out so you're gonna have to look fabulous!,8

S09E22 The Donor.txt,Phoebe,"Ok, that'll be great!",9
S09E22 The Donor.txt,Joey,"Oh, ain't that nice? The three of you trying on slutty lingerie together.",9
S09E22 The Donor.txt,Rachel,That's not what we're gonna do!,9
S09E22 The Donor.txt,Joey,"Why would you ruin it, who was that hurtin'?",9
S09E22 The Donor.txt,Monica,"Oh, I so can't believe this! My uterus is an inhospitable environment? I was trying so hard to be a good hostess!",11
S09E22 The Donor.txt,Chandler,"Oh, I can't believe my sperm have low motility because, let me tell you, when I was growing up they sure seem to be in a hurry to get places!!",11
S09E22 The Donor.txt,Chandler,Hi.,12
S09E22 The Donor.txt,Monica,Hi.,12
S09E22 The Donor.txt,Monica,Ok.,12

S09E22 The Donor.txt,Charlie,So you're up for keynote speaker! Who's making the decisions?,19
S09E22 The Donor.txt,Ross,"Professor Sherman, yeah. I've a meeting with him today.",19
S09E22 The Donor.txt,Charlie,He's a pretty tough guy to impress.,19
S09E22 The Donor.txt,Ross,"Yeah, well... I think I know how to dazzle him.",19
S09E22 The Donor.txt,Rachel,"Oh... you're not gonna do a magic trick, are ya?",19
S09E22 The Donor.txt,Ross,"Wait a minute, you guys. Oh, I wanna ask you something. I-I I may get to speak at this paleontology convention and if I do, I'd love for you guys to come and hear me.",21

S09E22 The Donor.txt,Joey,"All right, so. How did it go at the fertility clinic?",24
S09E22 The Donor.txt,Chandler,Not as much fun as last time. Apparently you only get porn if you're giving a sperm sample.,24
S09E22 The Donor.txt,Ross,So-so what did the doctor say?,24
S09E22 The Donor.txt,Chandler,"Well... there's surrogacy, but Monica has dreamt her whole life of carrying a child, she has felt that watching a surrogate would be... too hard for her.",24
S09E22 The Donor.txt,Joey,So you're ruling out surrogacy?,24
S09E22 The Donor.txt,Chandler,Yeah.,24
S09E22 The Donor.txt,Joey,"So, I don't have to learn what that means?",24
S09E22 The Donor.txt,Chandler,"Aside from adoption the only other choice is insemination, so... we're talking about sperm donors.",24
S09E22 The Donor.txt,Joey,"Enough said, I'm there for you man. Where is she, upstairs?",24
S09E22 The Donor.txt,Ross,How do you feel about all this?,25
S09E22 The Donor.txt,Chandler,I wish there was an easier way for us to have a child but I don't think there is one.,25
S09E22 The Donor.txt,Joey,"Come on Ross, be a good guy. Step up and do it!",25
S09E22 The Donor.txt,Ross,The data we are receiving from MRI scans and DNA testing of these fossils are - are staggering.,29

S09E22 The Donor.txt,Phoebe,"Oh, I'll take some of that.",33
S09E22 The Donor.txt,Rachel,"Pheebs, that's for men!",33

S09E22 The Donor.txt,Rachel,Really?,37
S09E22 The Donor.txt,Charlie,"Yeah! Actually Joey and I are going to the movies tonight, wanna come?",37
S09E22 The Donor.txt,Rachel,"Oh, I can't. Because I-I've seen them.",37

S09E22 The Donor.txt,Rachel,Sure!,38
S09E22 The Donor.txt,Phoebe,Ok!,38
S09E22 The Donor.txt,Charlie,"Wha, you know, maybe we can do something else!",38
S09E22 The Donor.txt,Rachel,You know that depends on what it is! I've done a lot of stuff.,38
S09E22 The Donor.txt,Phoebe,"So what were you doing out there, do you not like Charlie?",39
S09E22 The Donor.txt,Rachel,"She's ok, I just don't get a really good vibe from her!",39
S09E22 The Donor.txt,Phoebe,Why?,39
S09E22 The Donor.txt,Rachel,"I don't know, you know, just the way she waltzed in here all smart, and tall! You know, and just swept Joey off his feet... I mean, nobody else has a chance!",39
S09E22 The Donor.txt,Phoebe,Who else?,39
S09E22 The Donor.txt,Rachel,"Anybody! You, me, you know, Monica's mom...",39
S09E22 The Donor.txt,Phoebe,You like Joey?,39
S09E22 The Donor.txt,Rachel,"Shhhhh! Phoebe! All right, look. I have a little thing for him.",39
S09E22 The Donor.txt,Rachel,"It's just physical and I have it totally under control! Ok? It's just, when I see them together, sometimes I just get a little jealous!",40
S09E22 The Donor.txt,Phoebe,"Uh, wow! Isn't it ironic that he liked you and now you like him?",40
S09E22 The Donor.txt,Phoebe,"Oh well, as long as it is under control, you know, you can't do anything about it, he's already dating her, and she is a nice person, that wouldn't be right.",41
S09E22 The Donor.txt,Rachel,"I know, I know, so it is just not a big deal.",41
S09E22 The Donor.txt,Phoebe,Yeah.,41
S09E22 The Donor.txt,Rachel,So can we keep this between us?,41
S09E22 The Donor.txt,Phoebe,Sure!,41
S09E22 The Donor.txt,Rachel,"Ok, great, because I gotta get out of here, the smell of beets is killing me!",41
S09E22 The Donor.txt,Phoebe,Oh.,41
S09E22 The Donor.txt,Phoebe,Any chance Charlie has a deaf twin?,42
S09E22 The Donor.txt,Monica,Hi honey!,43
S09E22 The Donor.txt,Chandler,"Hey! Look I brought a friend for dinner, this is Zack, from work!",43
S09E22 The Donor.txt,Monica,"Oh, of course, it's so nice to see you again, Zack!",43
S09E22 The Donor.txt,Monica,I got it.,45
S09E22 The Donor.txt,Zack,Thanks.,45
S09E22 The Donor.txt,Monica,"Yeah, I guess.",46
S09E22 The Donor.txt,Chandler,"So, how would you like to have a baby that's half yours and half his!",46
S09E22 The Donor.txt,Chandler,"Well, we're talking about sperm donors and Zack may be the guy! I mean, look, he's intelligent, he's healthy, he's athletic, I mean, he is ""spermtastic""!",47
S09E22 The Donor.txt,Monica,"Chandler, this is crazy! What did you even say to him! ""Come up, meet my wife! Give us your sperm""!",47
S09E22 The Donor.txt,Chandler,"No, I invited him to dinner so you could get a chance to get to know him! I mean, if we go through a sperm bank you never meet the guy, get to check him out.",47
S09E22 The Donor.txt,Monica,Chandler!,47
S09E22 The Donor.txt,Chandler,"I'm telling you, he's great! I mean, even if my sperm worked fine, I'd think he'd be the way to go!",47
S09E22 The Donor.txt,Monica,I'm not going to be a part of this! You can't just bring some random guy at home and expect him to be our sperm donor!,47
S09E22 The Donor.txt,Chandler,Ok!,47
S09E22 The Donor.txt,Monica,Uh!,47
S09E22 The Donor.txt,Zack,Thanks! Do you have a coaster? I don't wanna make a ring.,48
S09E22 The Donor.txt,Monica,"Tell me about yourself, Zack!",49
S09E22 The Donor.txt,Rachel,"Oh, God, do you think she heard? It would be so bad if she heard!",50
S09E22 The Donor.txt,Phoebe,"Well, maybe she didn't hear! Ok I'm gonna go into that dressing room, you stay in here and I'll talk and see if you can hear me.",50
S09E22 The Donor.txt,Rachel,"Ok, great!",50
S09E22 The Donor.txt,Rachel,"Oh, thank God I can't hear a word that you're saying!",51
S09E22 The Donor.txt,Rachel,"Ok well, I heard that! Which means that she heard it too!",56
S09E22 The Donor.txt,Phoebe,Ooh! We have a problem.,56
S09E22 The Donor.txt,Rachel,Oh! What are we gonna do?,56
S09E22 The Donor.txt,Stranger,Just be honest with her.,57
S09E22 The Donor.txt,Rachel,Oh my God!,57

S09E22 The Donor.txt,Joey,Then don't go!,85
S09E22 The Donor.txt,Phoebe,"Mike knows I'm coming, and if I don't show up he'll think it's because of him! And I don't want to lose face! That's a very serious thing in my culture.",85
S09E22 The Donor.txt,Joey,"Alright, then you go to that party and you pretend to be over Mike. And afterward you come to my place and I'll get you good and drunk!",85
S09E22 The Donor.txt,Phoebe,"You got it! Ok. But not on the wine that you made, ok, because I just don't want to go back to the Emergency Room.",85

S09E22 The Donor.txt,David,"She's also a scientist, so she's very smart and pretty and... well, it's actually because of you, really, that we're together, I mean, I saw what you had with that Mike guy, and I just said ""Boy, I want that"".",90
S09E22 The Donor.txt,Phoebe,Mike and I broke up.,90
S09E22 The Donor.txt,David,"You're kidding me. Because I'm not seeing anybody, I've just totally made that up.",90

S09E22 The Donor.txt,Zack,"I'm gonna take off now. You're gonna let me go home, aren't you?",95
S09E22 The Donor.txt,Chandler,You sure you don't wanna stick around a little longer?,95
S09E22 The Donor.txt,Zack,"No, no, I should get home, I'm kinda tired.",95
S09E22 The Donor.txt,Chandler,"Are you just tired now or are you always tired, 'cause that could be a sign of clinical depression.",95
S09E22 The Donor.txt,Zack,No it's just tiring having to figure out the age at which all my grandparents died. I'll see you tomorrow.,95
S09E22 The Donor.txt,Chandler,Ok.,95
S09E22 The Donor.txt,Chandler,I think we've found our sperm!,96

S09E22 The Donor.txt,Chandler,"Yeah, you think so, well? Should I ask him?",96
S09E22 The Donor.txt,Chandler,"Why not, just because his great-grandmother was obese, our kids are gonna get that from you anyway!",97
S09E22 The Donor.txt,Monica,"No, that's not it. It's just that when we were asking him all those questions before, I just... I just realized I don't care if he's the most perfect guy in the world... he's not you.",97
S09E22 The Donor.txt,Chandler,"Yeah, he's better!",97
S09E22 The Donor.txt,Monica,"No, he's not. And if I can't get pregnant with you, then I don't want to get pregnant by... him or anyone else.",97
S09E22 The Donor.txt,Chandler,Really? Are you sure?,97
S09E22 The Donor.txt,Monica,"Yeah, I'm sure.",97

S09E22 The Donor.txt,Monica,Adoption.,99
S09E22 The Donor.txt,Chandler,How do you feel about that?,99
S09E22 The Donor.txt,Monica,I think I feel ok about it. Actually I think I feel really good about it.,99
S09E22 The Donor.txt,Chandler,Me too. I wanna find a baby that needs a home and I wanna raise it with you. And I wanna mess it up in our own specific way.,99
S09E22 The Donor.txt,Monica,"So this is it, we're really gonna adopt?",99
S09E22 The Donor.txt,Chandler,We are gonna be great parents.,101
S09E22 The Donor.txt,Chandler,"Wait, if we're lucky, and we're really really really quiet, we may be able to hear the sound of a condom breaking!",102
S09E22 The Donor.txt,Chandler,"Hey, Zack!",104

S09E22 The Donor.txt,Chandler,Really?,105
S09E22 The Donor.txt,Zack,No you did.,105

S09E22 The Donor.txt,Zack,"Oh, thank you.",107

S07E02 Rachels Book.txt,Joey,"Dude, what are you massaging an old man for?",65

S07E02 Rachels Book.txt,Chandler,Hey.,66
S07E02 Rachels Book.txt,Monica,"Listen umm, I’ve been thinking, it’s not fair for me to ask you to spend all of your money on our wedding. I mean, you work, you work really hard for that.",66
S07E02 Rachels Book.txt,Chandler,Ehh.,66
S07E02 Rachels Book.txt,Monica,"Eh, you work for that.",66

S07E02 Rachels Book.txt,Monica,You do?!,66
S07E02 Rachels Book.txt,Chandler,"Yeah, I’m putting my foot down. Yeah look, when I proposed I told you that I would do anything to make you happy, and if having the perfect wedding makes you happy then, then that’s what we’re gonna do.",66
S07E02 Rachels Book.txt,Chandler,"Eh, forget about the future and stuff! So we only have two kids, y’know? We’ll pick our favorite and that one will get to go to college.",67
S07E02 Rachels Book.txt,Monica,You thought about that?,67

S07E02 Rachels Book.txt,Chandler,"Uh, four, a boy, twin girls and another boy.",67
S07E02 Rachels Book.txt,Monica,What else did you think about?,67
S07E02 Rachels Book.txt,Chandler,"Well, stuff like where’d we live, y’know? Like a small place outside the city, where our kids could learn to ride their bikes and stuff. Y’know, we could have a cat that had a bell on it’s collar and we could hear it every time it ran through the little kitty door. Of course, we’d have an apartment over the garage where Joey could grow old.",67
S07E02 Rachels Book.txt,Chandler,Sure you do.,68
S07E02 Rachels Book.txt,Monica,"No, I want everything you just said. I want a marriage.",68
