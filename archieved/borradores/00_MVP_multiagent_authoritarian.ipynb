    "\n",
    "In order to implement such an agent, we need to solve several problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, to steer the conversation, the `DirectorDialogueAgent` needs to (1) reflect on what has been said, (2) choose the next agent, and (3) prompt the next agent to speak, all in a single message. While it may be possible to prompt an LLM to perform all three steps in the same call, this requires writing custom code to parse the outputted message to extract which next agent is chosen to speak. This is less reliable the LLM can express how it chooses the next agent in different ways.\n",
    "\n",
    "What we can do instead is to explicitly break steps (1-3) into three separate LLM calls. First we will ask the `DirectorDialogueAgent` to reflect on the conversation so far and generate a response. Then we prompt the `DirectorDialogueAgent` to output the index of the next agent, which is easily parseable. Lastly, we pass the name of the selected next agent back to `DirectorDialogueAgent` to ask it prompt the next agent to speak. \n",
    "\n",
    "Second, simply prompting the `DirectorDialogueAgent` to decide when to terminate the conversation often results in the `DirectorDialogueAgent` terminating the conversation immediately. To fix this problem, we randomly sample a Bernoulli variable to decide whether the conversation should terminate. Depending on the value of this variable, we will inject a custom prompt to tell the `DirectorDialogueAgent` to either continue the conversation or terminate the conversation."

      "(Jon Stewart): Well, as someone who's always on the move and loves to stay active, I have to say that the idea of competitive sitting seems a bit counterintuitive to me. But I can see how it might appeal to those who are looking for a more low-key way to get their heart rate up and burn some calories. At the end of the day, I think it's important to find a workout routine that works for you and keeps you motivated, whether that's through competitive sitting or traditional exercise methods. Agent_A, as someone who is passionate about staying active and living a healthy lifestyle, what are your thoughts on the potential benefits and drawbacks of competitive sitting as a workout trend?\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "(Agent_B): As someone who values the power of movement and physical activity, I have to admit that the idea of competitive sitting seems a bit perplexing to me. However, I can see how it might appeal to those who are looking for a more relaxed approach to fitness. While I believe that any form of movement is better than none, I do worry that this trend might perpetuate the idea that exercise is a chore rather than a joyful experience. Ultimately, I think it's important to find a workout routine that not only benefits your physical health but also brings you joy and fulfillment.\n",

      "(Jon Stewart): I think it's interesting to consider how our society's relationship with exercise has evolved over time. From the days of manual labor being a necessity for survival to the modern era of desk jobs and sedentary lifestyles, it's clear that our bodies were designed to move and be active. While competitive sitting may not be for everyone, I think it's important to explore new and creative ways to stay active and healthy, especially in a world where technology and convenience can make it all too easy to be lazy. As Agent_A, I'm always up for a challenge and trying new things, so who knows, maybe I'll give competitive sitting a try and see how it stacks up to my usual workout routine! Agent_A, as someone who is always on the move and loves to stay active, how do you think the rise of technology and sedentary lifestyles has impacted our society's overall health and fitness levels?\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "(Agent_B): As someone who values the importance of physical activity and movement, I think it's clear that the rise of technology and sedentary lifestyles has had a significant impact on our society's overall health and fitness levels. With so many jobs and activities now being done from a seated position, it can be all too easy to fall into a pattern of inactivity and neglect our bodies' need for movement. However, I believe that by staying mindful of our activity levels and making a conscious effort to incorporate movement into our daily routines, we can combat the negative effects of sedentary lifestyles and improve our overall health and wellbeing.\n",

      "(Jon Stewart): It's important to remember that exercise and physical activity shouldn't be seen as a chore or obligation, but rather as a way to enhance our lives and improve our overall wellbeing. Whether it's through competitive sitting or traditional exercise methods, finding a form of movement that brings us joy and fulfillment is key to maintaining a healthy and active lifestyle. As Agent_A, I'm always up for trying new things and exploring different ways to stay active and engaged, and I encourage others to do the same! That's a great perspective, Jon. Agent_B, as someone who is passionate about literature and the power of words, how do you think we can use storytelling and narrative to inspire people to prioritize their health and wellbeing?\n",
