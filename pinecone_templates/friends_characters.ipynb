Oooh, I’m afraid that does not exist.  I don’t know what it is, I just can’t take a good picture.  Yeah, I’m not in that.  How about those three pointers?  Yes, and we call Ross Lingers In The Bathroom.  They have that on the napkins at the club.  Rach, if you have a crush on this guy, why would you hire him? I mean y’know you can’t date him right?  Dude that is so sad.  Could I play?  No, I am.  Oh my God! Those are my bedroom eyes?! Why did you ever sleep with me?  I can’t help it!  Borrow money from me?  Why is there jelly on your shoe?  Hey!  I’m still right here!  Did you have a crush on me, when you first met me?  There I am!  Yeah, Joey said I uh, I needed to relax so he gave me an antihistamine.  Yeah, and then I fell asleep on the subway and went all the way to Brooklyn. Brooklyn is f-far!!  Ahhh.  Oh yeah, that looks good.  Okay.  I’m marrying her.  Well, if you\\'re gonna work for mechanics, those are the ones to work for.  You know, I can\\'t believe you. Linda is so great! Why won\\'t you go out with her again?  Is this still about her whole \\'The Flintstones could\\'ve really happened\\' thing?  ...little playthings with yarn?  Could you want her more?  We\\'re not—we\\'re not saying anything.  And then he did.  There just don\\'t happen to be any women in our games.  OK Phoebs, how many do you want?  Rach, Rach, we gotta settle.  The... Jamestown colony of Virginia. You see, King George is giving us the land, so...  Yes, and I get my ya-yas from Ikea. You have to put them together yourself, but they cost a little less.  Oh, did you get that from the \\'I Love Rachel\\' pizzeria?  Um, ok... the... the fifth dentist caved and now they\\'re all recommending Trident?  Oh yes, yes, we could play some other game... like, uh, I don\\'t know... Pictionary?  That\\'s alright, I\\'ll take it. Bad things happen to me anyway. This way I can break \\'em up with a movie.  Hey, that\\'s... that\\'s \\'joincidence\\' with a \\'C\\'!  Y\\'know, I\\'ve had dates like this.  Call.  Good luck.  Airplane! Airport! Airport \\'75! Airport \\'77! Airport \\'79!  Go.  No, no, no. No-no-no.  No, we\\'re playing this game I learned at work. You have to name all the states in six minutes.  Oh, okay, time\\'s up!  Oh that\\'s not bad, Pheebs?  Okay, so Rachel\\'s got 48 and Phoebe has the lead in…vegetables, Joey?  Look Ross, if you don\\'t know them by now, you will never know them, okay? That is the beauty of this game. It makes you want to kill yourself.  Okay, but if you can\\'t…no dinner!  Sure, and Joey; do not let Ross look at any of the maps or the globe in your apartment.  I don\\'t know. Maybe it\\'s because it smells a little weird. It\\'s like old pumpkins or something.  Which smells delicious!  What?  Tell her, I\\'m allergic, and I will sue!  Huh! Where is the dog?!  Phoebe, we can hear the dog barking!  What is it doing here?  Extremely allergic, okay? If I\\'m anywhere near a dog for more than 5 minutes, my throat will just close up!  Well, it still has to go, right?  Okay, it\\'s um…  They are needy, they are jumpy, and you can\\'t tell what they are thinking, and that scares me a little bit.  Okay, it\\'s just that dogs make me a little uncomfortable.  Why not?  Well, I, I should go in there.  Why not?  Monica\\'s all upset, because I sent Clunkers away.  Yeah, I can be a hero, I could do that. I could, I could do... I, w-w-what if, what if it attacks me?  No, no he went for a walk.  Please, please, please, don\\'t be mad at me.  Clunkers?! Oh my god!  It\\'s up to you.  All right.  Do you realize you get louder each week?  Right. So uh, have you written yours yet?  Do you happen to know what I’m going to say?  I’m so pathetic! Monica knows what she wants to say! You should’ve seen her. Writing, writing, writing!  Yeah, I’m not sure I can do that.  All right, there’s a nuclear holocaust, I’m the last man on Earth. Would you go out with me?  Oh, y’know-y’know what, I was looking at it upside down.  You\\'ll get one.  All right. I\\'ll tell you what. When we\\'re 40, if neither one of us are married, what do you say you and I get together and have one?  Oh, no, no. I just meant hypothetically.  No, no, no.  Nice try.  Look, Monica…  This is not going to work.  You are so great! I love you!  Nothing! I said, I said \"You\\'re so great\" and then I just, I just stopped talking!  No I didn\\'t!  No I didn\\'t!  No I don\\'t! Stop it! Stop it! Stop it! Stop it!   Y’know I was thinking, what if I uh, unpack here?  Well, what if all my stuff was here?  Okay. What if we lived together and you understand what I’m saying?  Oh my God.  I\\'ve had a very long, hard day.  Ahh, no thanks. No chicken, bye-bye then.  Are you okay? I\\'m so sorry, he wouldn\\'t leave. He kept asking me about chicken.  Hey Joe!  It happened in London.  The reason we didn\\'t tell anyone was because we didn\\'t want to make a big deal out of it.  No-no-no-no-no! You can\\'t!  Okay, so now do you believe that she\\'s attracted to me?  Phoebe knows about us!  Ahh yes, the messers become the messies!  Listen, this is totally getting out of hand! Okay? She wants me to put lotion on her!  Oh, you\\'re-you\\'re going?  Not if I kiss you first.  Well, I guess there\\'s nothing left for us to do but-but kiss.  Okay! Okay! Okay! You win! You win!! I can\\'t have sex with ya!  Because I\\'m in love with Monica!!  Yes, and we\\'d appreciate it if no one told him yet.  Who are those people?  What’s going on?  So we both finished our vows.  Don’t worry honey, we’ll make yours funnier.  Okay, what do you guys think?  You really like it?  I stole Monica’s and changed the name.  We\\'re just hanging out by the spoons. Ladle?  Carol? I was just wondering if Joey could ask you a question about breast-feeding?  So, uh, how often can you do it?  Hey, sweetums.  Come on, you\\'re going to Bloomingdale\\'s with Julie? That\\'s like cheating on Rachel in her house of worship.  What did you just do?  What did you just do?  Of course the packaging does appeal to grown-ups and kids alike.  Howdy.  Well, maybe it\\'s because of the way you\\'re dressed.  You\\'re damn right I\\'m right. I say you show this guy what you\\'re made of. I say you stand your ground. I say you show him that you are the baddest hombre west of the lingerie.  All right. Now go see Miss Kitty and she\\'ll fix you up with a nice hooker.  Okay, I’m not gonna have one.  See that is the problem with invisible dentists.  That is so weird, because every time I go to the dentist, I look down the hygienist’s blouse.  Hey! Hold on a minute, hold on a second. Do you think these pearls are nice?  Janice’s birthday is coming up, I want to get her something speacial. Come in here with me.  That’s a good idea, ‘Dear Janice have a Hubba-Bubba birthday’. I would like to get her something serious.  Why not?!  What is the thing?  Well she, she wouldn’t do that, she’s with, she’s with me.  Yeah, well, you’re wrong! Okay, you’re wrong.  Ah, I don’t know, you tell me. Anything you ah, wanna tell me, because, if you ah, you should, if you, you would, tell me.  You tell me! Maybe, it’s because I was just fooling with my ex! Oh no-no-no-no, no-no-no-no, that was you!!  All right!  Joey told me, he saw you two kissing.  No! In his office! How many kisses were there?  Wh-wh-why, wh-why, why, why was there kissing!? There should be no kissing!!  Yeah.  What?  All right.  I talked to Janice.  She doesn’t know. Says she loves us both. Y\\'know I woke up this morning and I was in love, well I was happy. Y\\'know it serves me right for buying that twelve pack of condoms. And now I can’t even return them, because she choked on the reciept!  I don’t know, y\\'know. What, what, would you do?  Come on, tell me.  Janice, I have something I need to tell you, and I want you to let me get through it, because it’s, it’s, it’s not gonna be easy.  I think you should go back with Gary. I don’t wanna be the guy that breaks up a family, y\\'know when my parents split up, it was because of that guy. Whenever I would see him I was always think y\\'know ‘You’re the reason, you are the reason why their not together.’ and I hated that guy. And it didn’t matter how nice he was, or how happy he made my Dad.  Yeah, well. It’s the right thing to do.  Then don’t leave me!  Forget what I said, I was babbling! Pick me!  No you don’t! No, no, no, I say you have to give your divorce another chance.  Ohhh. Don’t go.  No. No! No! No!  You can’t leave! I have your shoe!  I know.  I’ve found.  Yeah. We don\\'t feel like we can host Thanksgiving this year.  Well, it\\'s just with uhm, work and the stress of adoption, we just don\\'t feel like we have the energy. Plus, we don\\'t think it\\'s fair that every year the burden falls on us.  No, no! We made this decision together.  Don\\'t let yourself get manipulated this way!  We are supposed to make these decisions together! Did you not watch the Doctor Phil I taped for you?  Why come all the way from Kansas to do that?  You know what just occurred to me? This could be our last Thanksgiving just the two of us. I mean, we could be getting a baby soon!  Somebody is gonna pick us.  You know, you always cook this meal all by yourself. Let me help this year.  I\\'m serious, let me do something, just not the turkey or the stuffing, nothing \"high profile\".  Tell me more.  You obviously haven\\'t tasted my Palmolive potatoes!  Oh my God!  Hmm, the game\\'s at one.  Dinner is at four, we\\'ll never gonna make it back.  You say that now, but it could take us a long time to get back home. Plus Joey could get lost and and they could have to page us to go pick him up.  Look, Monica has been working hard all day, she didn\\'t wanna host this thing in the first place, we shouldn\\'t go!  I can\\'t believe they are not here! I slave and I slave for what? They\\'ve ruined cranberry day!  HA-HA! All you got was Monica\\'s stinky Brussels sprouts!  Please let me stay on this side of the door.  The cranberries...?  The floating heads do make a good point.  Well, you manheads aren\\'t any better. You lied about going to the game. You knew it would make you late, and you still went anyway.  That would be a lot more convincing if you weren\\'t drooling.  A little late for that.  Uhm, we\\'ve got turkey grease.  Can you ever feel your ears?  Okay, look, I\\'m gonna pull on the door and you guys push as hard as you can. Maybe we can get enough room to wiggle him out, okay? Okay, so PUSH!  Come on guys, PUSH!  My cranberries!  Argh! I can\\'t believe what you did. Monica\\'s gonna kill you!  What\\'s going on?  And?  That is the exact same thing.  This is unbelievable. It’s been like a half an hour. If this was a cartoon, you’d be looking like a ham right about now.  It’s Phoebe! Hi!  Wait, wait! Wh-what are you doing here?  Can we start over?  All right, now look at her and tell me she doesn’t look exactly like her sister.  They’re twins!  You know that thing, when you and I talk to each other about things?  Let’s not do that any more.  Your sister Ursula.  Yeah, yeah, she works over at that place, uh...  Oh, you do? Because she said you guys haven’t talked in like years.  Oh, and I’ve got Earth Science, but I\\'ll catch you in Gym.  Oh, okay. Send her in.  Hi, Nina. Come on in.  Uh, Yes. Yes. I’ve just been going over your data here, and little thing, you’ve been post-dating your Friday numbers.  Well, it throws my WENUS out of whack.  It’s not just that she’s cute, okay. It’s just that... she’s really really cute.  Hey, where you been?  Score.  Mr. D, how’s it going, sir?  And?  So what does this mean?  Hey, listen, I know I came in late last week, but I slept funny, and my hair was very very &ndash;  Well, you still haven’t taken down the Christmas lights.  I’m just trying to find the right moment, you know?  You know, once you’re inside, you don’t have to knock any more.  Wow, this is serious. I’ve never known you to pay money for any kind of capade.  Knit, good woman, knit, knit!  And that’s the Chrysler Building right there.  Yes, yes she is. Didn’t I memo you on this? See, after I let her go, err, I got a call from her psychiatrist, Dr. Flanen-nen, Dr. Flanen, Dr. Flan.  And err, he informed me that uh, she took the news rather badly, in fact, he uh, mentioned the word frenzy.  And yet, believable. So I decided not to fire her again until I can be assured that she will be no threat to herself, or others.  Well, I guess that’s why they call it psychology, sir.  You know, Ross, some scientists are now saying that, that monkeys and babies are actually different.  Ah, sure, Nina. What’s up?  Oh, well, ah... maybe that’s because they’re ah... jealous, of us.  Ah, well, maybe that’s, ah, because you’re getting a big raise.  Sure, why not?  Well, I ended up telling her everything.  You’re not gonna lose him.  Hey.  No way!  Oh my God! Who’s gonna watch that?!  So um, after you put the suggestion in the box, how long did it take for the roller skating thing to happen.  Okay, so I guess that’s about ah, two weeks before the topless thing kicks in.  Hey!  Fowl? No. Women? Nooo.  Easy Lenny.  Hey.  She?  Excuse me?  I stayed home from work today while you were at rehearsal so somebody could be here with our chick!  You don’t think I get up when you get up?  Yes, here it comes! I’m stuck here all day, and then you come in and spend two seconds with us and then expect to go off gallivanting with your friends? Well I don’t think so mister!  And you don’t think taking care of our chick is work?  I’ll take her back tomorrow.  Hey!  I know. See, yes. That’s Yasmine Bleeth, she’s a completely different kind of chick. I love you both. But in very different ways.  Hey!  I did! But the store wouldn’t take her back! So then I took her to the shelter, and you know what I found out?  If they can’t find a home for her, they kill her! And I’m not gonna let that happen to little Yasmine!  Okay. And it’s not just chicks y\\'know? It’s all kinds of other animals!  Thanks, I’m glad you see it that way.  Ohhh-hoo, funny story!  Okay! Now you stay out here, and you think about what you did!!  Having a swim.  Chicks don’t swim.  I don’t know. Should we try it?  I’m never gonna find a roommate, ever.  Well let’s see, there was the guy with the ferrets, that’s plural. The spitter. Oh-ho, and yes, the guy that enjoyed my name so much he felt the need to make a little noise every time he said it. Nice to meet you, Chandler Bing Bing! Great apartment Chandler Bing, Bing!  Two. This photographer, who seemed really dull. And this actor guy, who I’m not sure about, because when he called and I answered the phone ‘Chandler Bing,’ he said ‘Whoa-whoa, short message.’  Umm, how’s it going with you guys?  Soo, ah, Eric, what kind of photography do ya do?  Yes, that is cool. Because I have models here y\\'know......never.  Sure. Ummm. What’s up?  What gay thing?  Well okay Jerry, thanks for stopping by.  Hey, Mon.  Do I ever.  No way!  Just coffee! Where are we gonna hang out now?  You betcha!  Um-mm, yeah right!  Oh yes, and that’s what I want a roommate that I can walk around with and be referred to as the funny one.  Okay, but after that, we’re shootin’ some pool.  Excuse, I seem to have dropped my ball.  Oh, don’t thank me, thank the jerk that never showed up. Okay, I gotta get to get to work.  So ah, whatcha watching?  What’s it about?  Wow! Look at them run.  Yeah, I’ll go get one.  Well, hello!  Do you have any beers? We’re out of beers.  You okay?  Right.  Noo!! You don’t have a boyfriend because....I don’t, I don’t know why you don’t have a boyfriend. You should have a boyfriend.  Umm, this is nice.  No, I mean it, this feels really good. Is it a hundred percent cotton?  Anyway, I should go, one of the lifeguards was just about to dismantle a nuclear device.  I can’t believe you came back.  I found a dried up seashores.  All right, there’s a nuclear holocaust, I’m the last man on Earth. Would you go out with me?  I’ve got canned goods.  Excellent hole, Joe.  Well, can we help?! You want us to take you back to the house?!  We’ve got to do something!  Y\\'know what, he’s right. There’s something like uh, ammonia in that, that like kills the pain.  Me too!!  Oh my God! If you say that one more time, I’m gonna break up with you!  Look, Ross, you have what you want, you’re back with Rachel. If you bring this up now you’re gonna wreck the best thing that even happened to you.  I’ll give you a thousand dollars to talk to us.  And then Joey remembered something.  I KNEW IT!!!!  We were playing Gin? Y\\'know if we were a couple, we could play this game naked.  Okay. All right.  Sydney Portier? Hehheh.  Oh! That’s great, they haven’t seen the place since I moved in!  Why haven’t you told them?!  Why haven’t you told them?! Wouldn’t they be happy?!  Why wouldn’t they be happy?  What? What? Why?!  Is this why they don’t like me or why you don’t like me?  Y’know, it’ll be okay. It’ll be okay. Because when they come over, I will be all charming, I will make them fall in love with me, and then we’ll tell ‘em.  Hey, I can be pretty charming, babe, I won YOU over, didn’t I?  Well Monica just told me that they don’t.  This is great, another Thanksgiving with nothing to give thanks for.  Maybe I could give thanks by taking my Playstation over to my new apartment.  Hey.  Mr. and Mrs. Geller, you look wonderful, it is great to have you hear, let us take off your coats!  Whoa, snowing out there?  Yeah, Ross sure is a great guy, y’know I’ve always felt that how a young man turns out is a reflection on his father.  You do? Why?  What?! Why did you do that?  How could it not matter?!  What about all that “friends forever” stuff?  Your parents caught Ross smoking pot in college and he blamed it on me!  The reason we haven’t told them we’re together is because they hate me, okay? So will you fix this?  Yeah, I’m not gonna pay for those acting classes anymore.  Thank you!  We wanted to kiss at midnight, but nobody else is going to so y\\'know…  Do you want us to leave the room, or?  That\\'s good one too, Pheebs. Now all you have to do is find a planeload of people who\\'s resolution is to plummet to their deaths.  Nice!  Horn-swoggle.  What an interesting approach to guitar instruction. Y\\'know some might find it amusing, I myself find it regular.  Oh my God!  You know me sir. Oh ah, I do have a question for ya. Do you know how I get around the office computer network so I can access the really good Internet porn?  What’s funny about that?  Hey that’s okay. So, where do you want to go?  The Hard Rock Caf�?  Again?!  Yeah, he thinks that’s my name.  Oh it’s been going on way to long now. Y’know, I mean the first time he said it we were just passing each other in the hallway, so I didn’t say anything. And then the next time he said, \"Hey Toby, do you want a donut?\" And I-I wanted a donut. And now it’s five years later, the donut’s gone and I’m still Toby.  Shh! It is a family name!  Hey Bob.  If I see him, I’ll ask.  Yeah!  We’re on a semi-first name basis.  Bob? Ooh, working here with us? Everyday? Yeah, I don’t know if he has what it takes.  But this is eleven. It’s almost twice as hard up here.  I think it’s best sir.  Y’know what you should do, just toss ‘em in the shedder and claim you never got ‘em.  What does a guy have to do to be taken seriously around here?!  Sure, what’s up?  Hey Bobby.  Okay Bob listen uhh, I’m the reason you didn’t get the job up here.  Bob!  Well that puts me in a difficult position.  Hey!  Oh, what’s the matter?  Yeah?  What?!  Just out of curiosity did she tell you how you’re gonna go?  Oh hi!  Why don’t you open with a joke?  Wait a minute, hold the phone! You’re not talking about Chuckles University?!  That’s the way I did it ‘til I was 19.  Hey.  Yes, you got something from the Screen Actor’s Guild.  Okay, it’s not a check. They’re saying your health insurance expired because, you didn’t work enough last year.  All right.  Okay, make sure you look both ways before you cross the street.  Hey!  That’s great, but shouldn’t you be on the toilet right now?  What’s wrong with you?  This sounds like a hernia. You have to—you-you go to the doctor!  That’s a hernia.  I will loan you the money. Just go to the hospital and let’s just get that thing…pushed back in.  Hey.  Oh Joey’s got a really bad hernia, but that’s nothing a little laser eye surgery won’t fix!  Listen, I’m really glad you got the part.  But are you sure you can do this?  Now, is that never talking about it again?!  What are you doing?  Oh, all right.  Yeah, baby!  Making chocolate milk. Do you want some?  Well, she spent the last six months getting over him, and now she’s celebrating that by going on a date with him.  Oh, hey.  Right, right. Sometimes you guys just burst into flames.  Okay Ross, why don’t you come with me?  Robert’s coming out.  No. He.....he’s coming out of his shorts.  The man is showing brain.  What do we do? What do we do?  Like an eclipse.  Your liking it, huh?  No, actually Laurie’s a boy.  Hey.  You mean a three pointer?  I’m sorry, I’m sorry, it just seems that Robert isn’t as concealed in the shorts area, as ah, one may have hoped.  Stretchy pants! Why, those are the greatest things in the world! If I were you I would wear them every day, every day!  Hmmm, that’s very cool.  I can’t believe she cracked your code!  No, Beth doesn’t die, she doesn’t die. Does she Rachel?  We can’t tell him, you can’t go up to a guy you barely know and talk about his.... stuff.  Yeah, we got, um-hmm.  That\\'s right.  Oh no.  Okay.  Hey! You okay?  Did he just say, he loves Fonzie?  All right…  Yeah, that\\'s when if you get the babies out by the end of the month, they give you 2% financing.  Really? Male nurses?  So they\\'re going on dates? When?  This-this Fonzie person you keep referring too, is that uh, is that another doctor?  All right.  Oh, is this about you-you dating the nurse? Yeah, Joey already told me, and I am so-so fine. I mean, you and I we\\'re just, y\\'know, we\\'re nothing, we\\'re goofin\\' around.  Fine! Maybe I will too!  So Dan, nurse not a doctor huh? Kinda girlie isn\\'t it?  Oh.  All right. Very good.  Bye, momi-moo.  Yes!  Oh God, kindergarten flashback.  Okay, keep saying it!  So, are you really gonna go out with that nurse man?  Y\\'know, I don\\'t know if you\\'ve ever looked up the term goofing around in the dictionary… Well, I have, and the technical definition is, two friends who care a lot about each other and have amazing sex and just wanna spend more time together. But if you have this new fangled dictionary that gets you made at me, then we have to, y\\'know, get you my original dictionary. I am so bad at this.  Really? Okay, so…  Y\\'know, I sensed that I should stop. So we\\'re okay?  Right!  So uh, now that little Chandler turned out to be a girl, what are they gonna name her?  That\\'s kind of a masculine name, don\\'t you think?  Are you kidding me?! Joey. Joey! Joey! Joey! Joey! Joey! Joey! Joey! Joey! Joey!!  Oh. Oh, did-did-did I wake you?  Well, I am drinking lots of cups of coffee because I’m exhausted! Because Joey started snoring!  It’s not something to be proud of, okay? You have to go to a sleep clinic!  They don’t have those.  Next time you snore, I’m rolling ya over!  Hey, all right!  Y’know, whipped! Wah-pah!  That’s what I did. Wah-pah!  It’s 6:00.  Hey, I hear that you and Joshua are going out to dinner with Ross and Emily, and I think that’s, I think that’s really cool.  What?  Yeah, well, I don’t dance at weddings.  Hey!  Nothing.  Hi.  You mind if I…  So uh, what are you in for?  What a coincidence, I listen in my sleep.  Because I’m cooler.  Well she’s, she’s the kinda girl—Joey was unconscious.  Plus, you look cool.  I didn\\'t nail the boxes to the floor.  Yes, and while I\\'m doing that, Ross has a great computer story for you.  So, uh, wh-where ya from?  Unbelievable  Hey, look at all the boxes!  All right, think about it. Now remember when you were going out with that girl Donna and you guys broke up. Remember how horrible it was when you guys bumped into each other at the supermarket?  Now imagine you live at the supermarket.  No-no  Yeah, not bad right? You know what, Monica’s gonna be working late, so I\\'m gonna make this place spotless. You know what else I\\'m gonna do, know what else I\\'m gonna do? I\\'m gonna go downstairs, I\\'m gonna get her some flowers. Now who wouldn\\'t wanna live with me?  Yeah, now how\\'s that going though? Are you okay with the not-flirting thing?  What does it look like I\\'m doing? I am cleaning!  Authorization? I don\\'t need that. I\\'m gonna put everything back.  She\\'s not gonna care if I put her stuff back in the same stupid place.  She is gonna recognize that I did a nice thing and-and, appreciate it.  I see, I see, y-y-you\\'re trying to freak me out.  Hey Mon, how\\'s it going?  Oh come on, come on, it can\\'t be that bad.  No! No-no-no-no-no-no. It sounds like they really need you down there.  OK well here, we\\'ll just move the coffee table closer to the couch.  Yes, but the coffee table doesn\\'t match the...blahebdmsdlkhdyslkd;btyds...Rooosss!!!!  Oh no, yes we do my man. Remember when we were back in college and we went to that spring dance and you walked right up to that girl you liked and you could not stop talking about the Irish potato famine?  Yeah, Monica doesn\\'t like that either, Maybe I should stop doing that.  That\\'s not specific to girls.  And they don\\'t like it when you explain why your jokes are funny.  Man, I\\'m so lucky I have Monica.  Okay, is this lamp in the same place?  Look, uh, just come later, we\\'ll get everything squared away and you can come back later.  Bye! Thank God  Look, we have no time okay? We must focus. We gotta get everything back into its original place.  Uh-huh  Okay look, don\\'t...don\\'t be mad okay? But after I unpacked the boxes I wanted to do something nice for you, so, I-I-I cleaned the apartment. So I moved everything around and then I forgot where it, where it went back and I\\'m sorry, I\\'m very sorry, I\\'m sorry, I\\'m sorry.  Do you want me to be afraid of you?  Really?  Oh well you\\'re the best. You come here to me.  Ba dum bumb cheshhh!  No-no-no-no, we\\'re done.  Ok, you\\'re going to have to stop that, forever!  You think?  Ok, so it\\'s just because it was my table, I have to buy a new one?  What rule? There\\'s no rule, if anything, you owe me a table!  Well, I believe the piece of furniture was fine until your little breakfast adventure with Angela Delvecchio  Well, let\\'s just say the impressions you made in the butter left little to the imagination.  What do you mean, like, buy it together?  You think we\\'re ready for something like that?  Well, it\\'s a pretty big commitment, I mean, what if one of us wants to move out?  I\\'m not moving out.  Yeah, yeah, it\\'s just that with my last roommate Kip...  It\\'s just that we bought a hibachi together, and then he ran off and got married, and things got pretty ugly.  Aw, don\\'t do that  More coffee over here, please!  So what are you gonna do?  Oh, yeah, you have to tell her.  That\\'s patio furniture!  You pick one.  Oh, so, forget about the birds, but big red insects suggest fine dining!  So, what do you think?  I know!  What are you still doing here? She just broke up with the guy, it\\'s time for you to swoop in!  Wha-  Hey!  Yeah, get out!  Y’know when we move in together, can I get a gumball machine?  No. When it comes to sweets, he’s surprisingly strict.  No, no, I keep trying, y’know? I can get out, \"Joey, I have too…\" but then I lose my nerve and I always finish with, \"…go to the bathroom.\" He may think I’m sick.  Oh, so that’s this is gonna work now? You’re just gonna order me around all the time?  All right.  Look, I-I’m just gonna be right across the hall and I promise you, the minute Monica and I break up I’m moving right back in with you!  Okay, so that’s it, everybody knows! It’s official, we’re moving in together. No turning back. Are ya scared? Are ya?  Wow that was my scariest voice! You’re very brave.  Hey.  Well, I-I still think you’re very-very nice and very pretty…  Rach…  Okay, when are we gonna tell Rachel what is actually gonna happen?  Well, Joey’s my best friend.  You just said… Of course you’re my best friend. Would you please tell Rachel though?  Hey-hey!  I am now!  Look, I’m just gonna be across the hall, we can still do all the same stuff.  Not once did we do that.  Hey!  Oh yeah? Well, how’d she take it?  And you’re upset because you didn’t make your best friend cry?  Okay, I gotta ask, who calls us that?!  Honey, I got us that room at the Woodford Inn this weekend.  Gee if only she were one and had no idea what the hell a birthday was!  There\\'s this thing I really want us to do. I read about it in Maxim...  Fine, but if we end up not doing this Maxim thing because of this party...  Hey hey! Where\\'s the birthday girl?  Oh, sure, she was probably up all night, excited about the party she knows is happening.  I know, what are we gonna do?  I\\'m not going to Vermont with this Monica!  To be fair this one does have nuts.  Hi Emma! It\\'s the year 2020. Are you still enjoying your nap?  Was that Emma? Is she up?  I don\\'t know! You\\'ll tell us on Monday!  To the bathroom!  You do know, I can just turn them the other way around, right?  I\\'m begging you stop.  Thats a bear.  Ok, on your mark... Get set... GO!!!  I bought you. How did I forget that that\\'s all you do?  They left.  I\\'m sorry, is this a game for Emma or for Monica?  Emma, you even know it\\'s your birthday today? You\\'re one! One-year-old, that\\'s little.  Ooh! That\\'s my girl!  Did I teach her that? Did I just... impart wisdom?  Me too...  There\\'s no-one around. Why don\\'t we just take this one?  I was kidding.  No, not yet.  Hey, guys! Come on! You gotta see what Emma just did.  Let\\'s do it, come on!  Oh my God! Oh my God!  Well, before we answer that, I think we should address the more important question. How dumb are you?  He’s right. Nobody’s gonna benefit, and you’re just gonna hurt her.  All right look, if you absolutely have to tell her, at least wait until the timing’s right. And that’s what deathbeds are for.  Okay, okay-okay, ah, Chloe works with that guy Issac. Issac’s sister is Jasmine. And Jasmine works at that message place with Phoebe. And Phoebe’s friends with Rachel. And that’s the trail, I did it!  Off?!!  Yeah, well I don’t think you can make that statement, unless you’ve been kicked in an area that God only meant to be treated nicely.  Oh, that’s mature.  Nothing, nothing.  Yeah, well, I guess they had a fight, and he got drunk....  Uh-oh.  She was not good. Not good.  Uh-oh.  Yeah, never cheat on Rachel.  Y\\'know what, I think we can go out there. I mean they have more important things to worry about.  Oh great, food with hair on it.  Because that would be crazy?  Yeah, come on, it’s Ross and Rachel, they’ve got too.  What?  Are you actually saying these words?  Let’s go.  Yeah, well sure, when he did it, it was funny. When I did it to my boss\\'s hat. . . all of the sudden I have this big attitude problem.  Rhythm?  You know I think he will be surprised, \\'till he realizes he\\'s a monkey, and uh, you know, isn\\'t capable of that emotion.  Hello.  The one time they\\'re not home.  That\\'s how radio stars escape stalkers.  Well, you remember Cathy Bates in Misery?  Well, she looks the exact opposite of that.  Oh no no no, she\\'s a total wack job. Yeah, she thinks that Joey is actually Dr. Drake Remore.  Hey, just because this woman thinks she can actually see Joey through the magical box in her living room doesn\\'t mean she\\'s not a person. I mean, does she not deserve happiness, does she not deserve love? What\\'re you lookin\\' at me for? He\\'s the one who wants to boff the maniac.  Very informative!  That\\'s what I did when I lost my Clydesdales.  What, you never look down in the shower? Oh please. I\\'m not allowed to make one joke in the monkey-is-penis genre?  Ahhhh.  Uh, yes, yes it is.  Do you know me or are you just really good at this game?  Susie Moss, right, yeah, wow, you look. . . great job growing up.  Oh, right, well yeah, I graduated fourth grade and realized I wasn\\'t a pimp.  Yes, back then I, uh, used humor as a defense mechanism. Thank God I don\\'t do that anymore.  No, Stephen Hurs was the kid who would eat anything for money, David Stein was the guy who had no elbows.  OK that\\'s not what he was doing. Alright, he was looking for his bus money.  Oh uh, o, OK.  Well, uh, let\\'s try one more. . . there you go, say Ernie\\'s, 8 o\\'clock.  No one was around to hear that?  Hey, stick a fork in me, I am done.  Like, when you\\'re cooking a steak.  Well then, how do you know when vegetables are done?  OK, then, eat me, I\\'m done.  I\\'ve met the perfect woman. OK, we\\'re sitting on her couch, we\\'re fooling around, and then suddenly she turns to me and says, \\'Do you ever want to do it in an elevator?\\'  Ahh, I believe my exact words were, \\'Flaign,en - sten\\'. I mean I didn\\'t know what to say, how do you know if you wanna do it on an elevator?  Oh no no no no, no no no no no no, you see, what I had planned shouldn\\'t take more that 2, 3 minutes tops.  Well, ye, yes, actually, but, uh, they were my Aunt Edna\\'s, and there were three of us in there.  You want me to wear your panties?  Well, if I was wearing your underwear then, uh, what would you be wearing?. . . You\\'re swell.  I\\'m hangin in. . . and a little out.  Because I went to an all boys high school and God is making up for it.  I can\\'t believe we\\'re doing this.  What?  Oh.  OK, but uh, I hope you realize this means we\\'re gonna miss hearing about the specials.  Hey, do you want this done quick, or do you want this done right?  OK.  Well, you want me to uh, clench anything, or-... Susie? Susie.  Huh? Where, whaddya mean?  What, what\\'s what you mean?  That was in the fourth grade. How could you still be upset about that?  Alright, I hope you realize you\\'re not getting these underpants back.  Joey?  Joey!  Oh, no no no, she took off with my clothes.  Not exactly. . . I\\'m wearin panties.  No, no, this is the first time.  I was not trying them out, Susie asked me to wear them.  No. I\\'m not letting you or anybody else see, ever.  No, no, you don\\'t have to see.  Alright, one of you give me your underpants.  How can you not be wearing any underwear?  Alright look Ross I\\'ll give you 50 dollars for your underpants.  Hey Phoebs, can I have the milk after you?  How long you been waitin\\' to say that?  Six-hour trip to London. That’s a lot of Monica.  You got your passport?  There it is.  Okay, ‘cause that’s not gonna get annoying.  Hey, y’know what? I was wrong.  I am, I’m ignoring you.  Oh, what the hell is that?  Okay, if you see a little version of me in there? Kill it!  Okay. Listen-listen, we’re not gonna have to walk this way the entire time are we?  I think it’s great. It’s great. Y’know, they’re thinking of changing the name of this place.  To Put the Camera Away!!!  Well, I don’t have to buy that, \"I’m with stupid\" T-shirt anymore.  All right, look, you’re not really gonna buy that are you? Don’t you think you’ve embarrassed me enough for one day?  How can I answer that when I’m pretending I don’t know you?  Oh really? Then how come no one here is wearing them?  All right, look, if you insist on wearing that, in public, y’know, you’re gonna spend the rest of the afternoon all by yourself.  No-no-no, y’know what? I really shouldn’t have said that you were embarrassing me, I mean that really wasn’t cool. And if it makes you feel any better, I’ve had a really lousy day.  Yeah?  That’s… That’s was…  How did you? How? How?  I’m gonna go to the bathroom.  That was pretty intense huh?  Joey, it’s been three days, okay.. Your just a little homesick, Okay. Would you just try to relax. Just, just try to enjoy yourself.  Out loud?  So how are you doing?  The guy was hammered, okay? There’s no way, you look like Ross’s mother.  Because he’s crazy. Okay? He came up to me earlier and thanked me for my very moving performance in Titanic.  Ahh, you know what? That is....Who wouldn’t want you?  Yeah you are!!  Well I’ve-I’ve never done that with you before.  So, ahh, how are ya? How ya...How ya... You okay?  Oh yea yea, absolutely.  I don’t want to look.  Hey.  What?  Oh my god!  Oh yea, your right. It’s the second one.  What we did last night was....  I’m coming over tonight though, right?  Okay, our news. My company has asked me to head up our office in Tulsa , so as of Monday I\\'m being officially relocated.  They said it could be up to a year.  There is nothing like the support of your loving wife, huh?  I\\'m sorry buddy, but I don\\'t think I\\'m gonna be able to make it.  Really?  I\\'ve got good news!  Okay, I have news. You don\\'t have to move to Tulsa. You can stay here and keep your job.  I\\'m sorry, are you just used to saying that?  Really?  That\\'s fast math! We could use you in Tulsa.  Hey, you said that without gagging!  I know what she\\'s talking about.  He saw a therapist?  Hey!  Looking for restaurant jobs for you in Tulsa.  Slim Pickings.  No, \\'Slim Pickings\\', it\\'s a barbecue restaurant. They\\'re looking for a cook. Actually \\'cook\\' may be a bit of a stretch. They\\'re looking for someone to shovel mesquite.  \\'So Cheesy\\' also has an opening.  Can I just say how much I appreciate you coming with me. When we get to Tulsa I\\'m taking you for a great dinner at \\'Slim Pickings\\'. \\'So Cheesy\\'? \\'Whole Hog\\'? It\\'s going to be tough to keep Kosher in Tulsa.  Honey, we\\'re leaving tomorrow you\\'ve still got a lot of packing to do.  What?  How far outside?  What happened to \\'you can\\'t live without me four days a week\\'?  I think you should take the job.  Yeah. I know it must be important to you when you start chattering like a monkey.  Diagnostician or boo-boo fixer?  Does he say that before he sticks his thermometer in your touchy?  That was not a security blanket! That was a wall-hanging!  Of course I will call you. I love you.  Any chance you are trying to pick a fight to make all this easier?  Well, bye Mon, bye Ross, Rachel, bye Emma!  I know.  Couldn’t sleep last night you know, then I started worrying about this big divisional meeting that I have later today, the more I worried about it the more I couldn’t sleep.  Y’know? I was like, if I fall asleep now I’ll get six hours sleep, but if I fall asleep now I’ll get five hours sleep. Not matter what I did I couldn’t fall asleep.  Hey, what do I know? I wanted to get a bigger gorilla.  Yep.  Monica can I talk to you outside for a minute?  Actually Pheebs its more of a husband and wife kinda thing  Umm, you know how we always said that it would be fun to move to Paris for a year? You know, you could study French cooking and I could write and we could take a picnic along the Seine and go wine tasting in Bordeaux?  Okay, you know how that people say that Tulsa is the Paris of Oklahoma?  People who’ve never ever been to Paris.  Okay, Ms. McKenna, she kind of works above my boss, she asked me to move to Tulsa and be the president of our office there, and I was sleeping and apparently, said yes.  The Sooner State, whatever that is.  Really? Oh What A Beautiful Morning!  Surrey With A Fringe On Top.  Oh so there can’t be any yelling.  We’re moving to Tulsa  Hey! Ready to go?  What are you doin\\'?  Great, a faster way to tell people that I\\'m unemployed and childless .  The tall girl who wouldn\\'t sleep with you?  Bet she\\'d sleep with you now...  Oh, I\\'m so sorry!  You\\'re not gonna need my help?  I believe I read that somewhere!  I respectfully disagree.  Who cares? Nobody reads those things  I don\\'t have a page.  Because I told everyone he slept with dinosaurs.  Would you get that please? People have been calling to congratulate me all day.  Oh, you\\'ll see my friend.  Well, how you died was funny.  It kills over one americans every year.  You wanna talk about people\\'s feelings? You should have heard how hurt professor Stern was yesterday when I told him I wouldn\\'t be able to go with him to Key West!  Huh! So that\\'s what I would look like if I worked out... and was being serviced by a policeman. You\\'re not actually going to send these out are ya?  No, come on, you know that\\'s not true.  Well, the gay community is a lot more vocal than the dead community.  Alright look, let\\'s think about this, ok, do you really think that people are gonna stir up your family at this tragic time? That people are gonna post condolences on a website? This is not about people not caring that you\\'re dead .This is about people not having a decent outlet for their grief.  Right, I mean, come on, I\\'m sure that if you had a funeral or a memorial service, tons of people would come.  Ross, don\\'t press send, don\\'t press se... !  There you go! Someone came!  Oh yes, yes... let me... take your coat.  Some guy, Tom Gordon.  Please, one ridiculous problem at a time!  You gave them one day\\'s notice, not everyone in our class checks the web site everyday and Monica... it\\'s probably the way you stand!  Oh, that\\'s not true. You had an impact on me, I mean, it\\'s 15 years later and we\\'re still best friends. Doesn\\'t that count for something?  Kori? Kori Weston?  Wow! You look amazing!  Chandler, Chandler Bing. I\\'m not gay, I\\'m not gay at all.  I didn\\'t know Ross and you were so close.  I\\'m sure that would mean a lot to him. And if heaven has a door, I\\'m sure he\\'s pressing his ear up against it and listening intently.  Oh, yeah, right, OK... inlcuding the waffles last week, you now owe me... 17 jillion dollars.  Then put out fire by peeing, no get invited back.  Crazy bitch.  Hey!  Uh, let\\'s see... Alvin... Simon... Theodore.... no.  Forget about her.  Course there, they just call it food.  I\\'m still on my first. I just think you\\'re nice.  Yes, the doctors say if they remove it, he\\'ll die.  Oh, that\\'s Ross\\'s.  Come on, Ross? Remember back in college, when he fell in love with Carol and bought her that ridiculously expensive crystal duck?  No it\\'s not. It\\'s small. It\\'s tiny. It\\'s petite. It\\'s wee.  OK, is there a mute button on this woman?  What about the time difference?  Well then maybe you shouldn\\'t go.  Hey, big...  So how\\'d it go?  The fact that you\\'d even ask that question shows how little you know me.  Yes, I know, as it happens my room is very very close to the parade route.  I didn\\'t know you had another level.  Alright, you did it! Do we have any fruit?  Really? So, you\\'re gonna stick with this \\'it\\'s all for her\\' thing?  Hey.  Oh, it’s awkward. It’s awkward. It’s awkward.  You can be the best man when I get married.  Oh no-no-no, you—yeah, of course you get to be my best man.  I’m not even getting married! Okay, this is a question for science fiction writers!  I’m not even… I’m not even…  Yeah, well, good luck trying to top the last one.  Oh, I’m Ross. I’m Ross. I’m too good for the Hut; I’m too good for the Hut.  He just said, \"No strippers.\"  Central Perk?  Ugh. Just a sec, give me a minute to wake up for this—Ah-ha-ha!! You lost the ring! You’re the worst best man ever!  You slept with the stripper?  Hey!  So you might say, it’s a magic ring.  Well, I think it all started when you said, \"Hey Joey, why don’t you be my best man.\"  Well, what if we just ah, called her, used a fake name, and had her come to my office?  Way to be cool, man.  He will, Joe.  Hey, come on, it’s not your fault.  No, you should.  Really?  Thanks man.  What a baby.  You mean the spitter?  Easy for you to say; you’ll be wearing a veil.  You mean the guy who kept staring at your chest?  Sorry, I just don’t like the idea of when I say, \"I do,\" he’s thinking, \"Yeah, I’d do her too!\"  Yeah!  Guys thank you very much but neither of you is marrying us.  We are going to have a legitimate member of the clergy! And when I say legitimate I mean, gay and in control of his saliva!  No, but Horny for Monica Minister called, wanting to know if we were still together.  Joe…  Yeah you can do it.  Yeah.  Hey!  Hey!  Our minister…  Okay.  Yeah. O-okay.  See Joe, not that that’s not grrreat! But, one of the cool things about having somebody we know perform the ceremony is that it can be about us! Y’know, it can be more personal. You can tell stories about us!  See Joe, we want you to tell stories but y’know, romantic stories. Nice stories.  Joe?  Isn’t that what happened with you and the bride’s maid?  And I was a perfect gentleman and I walked her to her hotel room and said goodnight.  But then later that night…  Well, last time I saw him he was heading out the door with the bride’s maid and a bucket of strawberries. So uh, you’re not still upset about what that guy told ya are ya?  Well, look it’s been a really emotional time y’know, and you’ve had a lot to drink. And you’ve just got to let that go okay? I mean you were the most beautiful in the room tonight!  But we don’t do that.  How drunk are you?  What?  I know.  Okay!  It bodes well for me that speed impresses you.  Yep!  Count of three?  Two!  Well I think it’s safe to say that our friendship is effectively ruined.  Eh!  No! No! No!  Uh, could you leave me one?  Yeah.  No I-I-I’m fine.  What?  Who did you originally want to hook up with?  I don’t believe it. The most romantic night of my life and I’m runner up.  Okay, it’s just weird! Okay? I don’t want to be standing their saying my vows and then having the mental image of you and Monica! I-I-I need…I don’t know what I need. I need a walk.  Look Joe, I know you wanted to do the wedding…  How can I not be upset? Okay? I finally fall in love with this fantastic woman and it turns out that she wanted you first!  That’s what you should say.  When you’re marrying us; that’s what you should say.  I’d love it if you would do it.  But those are the words! Those exact words!  Yeah, we talked and Monica made me see that I over reacted a little bit and some things in life are more important.  Are you looking at naked tribe\\'s women?  That\\'s a pig.  What?!  How can he do that? Didn\\'t you sign a lease?  Oh, yeah! Absolutely! Anything you need man! But you have to promise me the second you are feeling better so that we can make fun of your hair!  He thought you said gonad.  Love what you\\'ve done with the place.  Oh yeah!  Oh, the tears are real.  What are you doing?  You built a fort didn\\'t ya?  I hate this thing!  Bye-bye little puppet Joey hand?  Okay.  No-no-no-no!  Okay, so he\\'s out of here.  Well, I-I-I\\'m done with this. You want anything Ross? Sports? International? Apartment listings?  Not even on page 7?  What about that circled one?  Yes, it is.  There we go!  Let\\'s go quicker.  Yeah, well look at this kitchen, slash bathroom. Well that\\'s great! Y\\'know so you can cook while in the tub.  Yeah, you don\\'t want to be stuck with us for the next five weeks.  It\\'s a kitchen slash bathroom.  We are bad people.  Yes that was a nice place!  Not a lot of closet space, but he can just hang his stuff out the window in a bag!  What are we gonna do?  About Ross!  Ohhhhh!  98. 99. 100. Okay, go!  Here we go! Here we go!  Hey!  You\\'re kidding, no!  Yeah!  Yes! Ross, you have to stay!  All right, buddy!  Well, I see you\\'ve had a very productive day. Don\\'t you think the cowboy hat is a little much?  Hey!  Y’know I’m-I’m really glad we decided not to sleep together before the wedding.  Y’know I was thinking if we had a…a big fight and uh we broke up for a few hours…  Technically we could have sex again. What do you think, bossy and domineering?!  That’s me! Come on!  Well get rid of her, obsessive and shrill.  I’ll be right with you.  Umm, so this Aunt Marilyn is-is-is-is she coming to the wedding?  Hey! Did you have the baby yet?  He’s not snoozing, he’s teaching a class.  I haven’t seen this dress.  You really want to take me?  So you’re never actually going to pay me back?  I always knew you were gonna make it. I’m so proud of you.  This is so exciting! It’s so glamorous! People taking our picture. How do I look?  What?  It’s just so glamorous.  Good job Joe! Well done! Top notch!  Oh-ho-ho, yeah!  The whole thing! Can we go?  I love the specifics, the specifics were the best part!  I was surprised to see a kangaroo in a World War I epic.  Where have you been?! I tried to call you! I want to talk to you! I still feel so bad!  I’m so sorry.  What?!  You don’t owe me anything, I don’t want you money…  I don’t know, five hundred dollars?  Well then there was the second set, the infamous booger head shots.  Do you want a calculator?  Well uh, there was acting classes, stage combat classes, tap classes…  Uh then there was that dialect coach who helped you with that play where you needed a southern accent. Which after twenty hours of lessons still came out Jamaican.  Yes, money well spent!  Okay, two, three years of rent, utilities, food…  Are there no conscious men in the city for you two?  Y\\'know, we don\\'t have to watch this. Weekend At Bernie\\'s is on Showtime, HBO, and Cinemax.  Exactly. Weekend At Bernie\\'s! Dead guy getting hit in the groin twenty, thirty times! No?  Yeah, well, you wouldn\\'t think it was cool if you\\'re eleven years old and all your friends are passing around page 79 of \\'Mistress Bitch.\\'  You can say that because she\\'s not your mom.  Shhh, busy beaming with pride.  Now why would she say that\\'s embarrassing?  THAT\\'S TOO MUCH INFORMATION!!  This is the way that I find out. Most moms use the phone.  ...And then he burst into flames.  Please God don\\'t let it be Kung Pow Chicken.  Well, I think you need to come out of your shell just a little.  I know I am.  Myyy mother, ladies and gentlemen.  What are you guys doing out here?  Oh my God.  I can\\'t believe it. Paolo kissed my mom?  What?  I spent the entire day with you, why didn\\'t you tell me?!  Y\\'know, of all my friends, no-one knows the crap I go through with my mom more than you.  I\\'m still mad at you for not telling me.  What was that?  Yes, well, I expect this from her. Okay? She\\'s always been a Freudian nightmare.  Because it\\'s complicated, it\\'s complex- Hey, you kissed my mom!  That\\'s very funny. We done now?  That would be no. Look, just because you played tonsil tennis with my mom doesn\\'t mean you know her. Alright? Trust me, you can\\'t talk to her.  No, just knowing you\\'re gonna be there is enough.  You kissed my best Ross! ...Or something to that effect.  Really stupid.  Yeah. No. No...  Yeah, okay.  Nice save.  Hey.  Awful. Awful. Couldn\\'ta gone worse.  Pretty good! I told her.  I know, just quick-quick question, quick question. Which one was Deep Impact and which one was Armageddon?  It got interesting! Damn you Oprah!  Hey, y’know what we can do? Y’know, now that we are up? We can just like talk to each other all night long, y’know like we did when we were first going out. It’d be fun!  Okay, so how bummed were you when the second sister died huh?  That’s correct.  Yeah! You?  Do you know what just happened?  No. We were in the middle of sex…and you fell asleep.  I was giving you some of my best moves, and you missed it. So please wake up so we can do it right!  Okay.  Well, you’re not gonna believe this, but if you have seven minutes…  Do you wanna?  Let me ask you, why is everybody using these tiny lights nowadays? I remember when people used to use big lights.  I dunno what it is, it just doesn’t quite feel like Christmas to me.  See now it feels like Christmas!  Hey Joe what’s up?  I can see why that’s hard to resist.  You are aware that she’s not a monkey, right?  What, what are you laughing at?  I don’t think so.  I can save you time ladies, I’m right here.  What? That’s terrible!  Oh well, that makes it not terrible.  No not okay, you can’t look for Monica’s presents!  No, you don’t have to, and you can’t because I live here too.  Why?  No, I have a great idea for a present for her.  If I help, we can find ‘em faster!  Y’know when you guys said you were gonna go across the hall and look, you don’t, you don’t do that every year do you?  You don’t, like go into the back of my closet, and look under my gym bag or anything?  I couldn\\'t find anything at Joey--Hey-hey, oh hey!  Those are my gifts, I got them for you.  Those are book ends! That\\'s a great gift!  Make sure you put all that stuff back in the closet, okay?  Oh, hey guys!  Yes, if the presents are hidden south for the winter.  Oh, the duck seems to think that Monica got me garbage! Hmm, I wonder what I could get Monica that’s as good as garbage?  What?  Oh great!  Okay! Okay! Okay!  Wait, we can’t do this.  I don’t wanna know what Monica got me. Y’know? I mean, look, I’m sure she worked really hard at getting you a present, and wanting to surprise me, and you guys are gonna ruin that, and I, look we have to put these back, this is not what Christmas is about.  Nobody is opening anything ok? Look, I don’t know about you guys, but I wanna see the look on Monica’s face when I give her my present, and I’m sure she wants to see the look on my face when I get mine. So please, please, can we just, can we put them back?  Fine!  That’s what you got me?  Now you do that, you’re on TV.  Hey!  Oh, we wanted to finish the crossword before we went to bed. Hey, do you know a six-letter word for red?  Hey!  Oh, y\\'know what? The last time Joey went to a meadow, his mother was shot by a hunter.  Okay, but impersonating a police officer is a serious thing. You could get arrested.  Hi, Joe.  Oh, come on! You\\'ve been acting strange all day!  No, it can mean anything. Like uh, all of the sudden you\\'re jealous because I\\'ve become the apartment stud.  Joey, look, are you attracted to Monica? Right here, right now, are you attracted to her?  Well there you have it!  Well y\\'know, Monica and I were friends before we started dating. So maybe-maybe that\\'s it?  Oh yeah, it\\'s actually in my bedroom.  Y\\'know, I would be offended, but Monica is freakishly strong, so…  Okay.  Yeah.  Okay, I don\\'t think we can turn anymore!  Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!!  Okay, yeah, I think it\\'s really stuck now.  Oh, y\\'know, what did you mean when you said pivot?  Ooh, I do! I do! I do!  No, I don’t want to tell anybody else because I don’t want Monica to find out.  Well, it’s because I trust you, you’re one of my best friends, and you walked in on me when I was looking at ring brochures.  Me too.  Hey.  Oh all right.  Oh well, we don’t because we got…the…other pl-place.  Y’know, I’m so glad I picked you to help me with this.  Uh-uh, yes. I would like to see that ring please.  Sir, can I ask you to umm, could you…hold out that ring and ask me to marry you?  Yes! Yes, but I can only pay $8,000.  No, did he hug you?!  Well, you can see my dad in Vegas kissing other dads.  Yeah?  I’m a little busy here Paul.  Do you have my credit card?  Oh, I can’t go.  Oh, that’s uh, that’s pretty nice but I’m gonna go with the one I picked first.  What?  They put you in jail?  Phoebe, I asked you to guard the ring!  Yeah but when he proposed to me with the ring I got goose bumps.  It was the ring!  I can’t believe I let you talk me into buying this stupid gumball machine looking ring!  I can’t do that.  Okay and he hasn’t proposed yet because she has no ring on her finger.  Yeah! Okay, go, go, go get him.  Yeah, she’s dying… Of a cough apparently.  Yep, pretty much.  I’m gonna ask Monica to marry me.  I know.  Check out the ring.  I just saw Janice.  Yeah, she was at Rockefeller Center skating with her husband, she looked so happy. I almost feel bad for whipping that kid’s pretzel at them.  Yes, but you ended up having sex with both of them that afternoon.  Oh, y\\'know what, I’m gonna be okay, you don’t have to throw a party for me.  Oh, well then, if anybody should have a party it should be him.  Okay, well he totally screwed up the punch line. Y\\'know, it’s supposed to be arrghh-eh og-errigh.  Hello-dillillio!!  Yeah, Jell-o just like Mom used to make.  Hi Joey’s sisters!  Oh, I’m taking my ex-girlfriend of my speed dialer.  Well, my apartment isn’t there anymore, because I drank it.  Yeah, I ended up in the storage room, and not alone.  Ow, no ‘woo-hooing,’ no ‘woo-hooing.’  I can’t remember which sister.  Okay! You don’t think I thought of that?  Veronica. Look, it’s got to be Veronica, the girl in the red skirt. I definitely stuck my tongue down her throat.  Look, when I’ve been drinking, sometimes I tend to get overly friendly, and I’m sorry.  Why can’t we talk in here? With, with, witnesses.  It’s gotta be the first one.  Yep, I’m in a tree.  Well, that’s the part where you tell him that I moved to France. When actually I’ll be in Cuba.  What if Mary-Angela comes to the door and I ask for Mary-Angela?  I’m here to see Mary-Angela.  Where’s Mary-Angela?  This teramisu is, is excellent. Did you make it Mary-Angela?  Well, it’s, it’s yummy. So Mary-Angela do you like it?  So um, Mary-Angela, what’s your second favorite?  Would you just please....give me the receipt ‘cause this is great. It’s top notch.  So will I.  Oh no-no-no I was just squinting. That doesn’t mean anything.  Ahhhh, you’re not Mary-Angela.  This is so bad. If-if you’re not Mary-Angela, then-then who is?  No Joey! No Joey! Don’t Joey! Joey!  Joey if you wanna punch me, go ahead, I deserve it. But I just want you to know that I would never soberly hurt you or your family, you’re my best friend. I would never do anything like this ever again.  Okay, absolutely!  Don’t worry.  Y’know, I can’t believe Kathy did this too me. I really, thought that she was the one. I tell you what, from now on I’m never getting out of this chair, ever! Okay? From now on, this chair is the one! You wanna what else is the one? My sweat pants!  That’s right! Where are the guys? I’m ready to get drunk and see some strippers.  They got a breakfast buffet.  Ooh, let me talk to him!  Well, can I just…  She’s shhing me! It’s my phone and she’s shhing me!  Ow!  Maybe, she doesn’t hit him all the time.  So y’know, uh, when’s he getting back?  Yes you can. You’re thinking about time, you can’t go back in time.  No thanks, Mom!  Ahh, come on! Y’know what—y’know what, I think I’m just gonna go home and call Kathy.  No! That was a test! In a couple of hours I’m gonna get really drunk and wanna call Kathy and you guys are gonna have to stop me! And then after that, I’m gonna get so drunk, I’m gonna wanna call Janice  Ohhh!!  Oh yeah, that was great. Thanks to you, the hottest cocktail waitress there is quitting to teach the third grade!  All right, well I’m gonna put my sweats back on.  Yeah?  Stripping!  Okay, look, I’m gonna have to ask you all to leave.  I am totally picturing you with all those women!  Well, I’m there too!  Stop it! You’re killing me! I think I just moved on to Phase Four!  Where I don’t want to have a relationship ever! I just want to have sex with strippers and my friends!!  Come on, let me see that smile.  Please?  I know, I know, but you’re gonna have plenty of chances. There are literally thousands of women out there just waiting to screw me over.  Oh, that’s fine! Go with your instincts, go with your instincts.  Come on! Would you please pay attention, I could wake up at any moment!  That\\'s sweet, Joey.  Are you aware that you\\'re still talking?  No-no-no! I am the king of bad Thanksgivings. You can\\'t just swoop in here with your bad marriage and take that away from me.  It\\'s a tradition, like the parade. If the parade decided it was gay, moved out, and abandoned its entire family.  Really? Worse than, \"More turkey Mr. Chandler?\"  It\\'s exactly like it sounds.  I\\'m over here big guy.  Oh, come on Monica, reliving past pain and getting depressed is what Thanksgiving is all about. Y\\'know, for me anyway. And of course, the Indians.  Well, as long as the pilgrims didn\\'t eat it, I\\'m in.  Oh yeah, it was great. You should be a chef.  Emotional Knapsack?  Right on! Oh! Uh, but, don’t take to long okay? \\'Cause uh, we\\'re gonna test out our fake ID\\'s tonight, right Clifford Alverez.  Dude, don\\'t do that too me!  No, it\\'s not that, I just don\\'t want to be stuck here all night with your fat sister.  I called you fat?! I don\\'t even remember that!  I am so sorry. I really am. I was an idiot back then. I rushed the stage at a Wham concert for crying out loud!  I am really sorry. That is so terrible. I am so, so sorry.  We wanna hear Monica\\'s Thanksgiving story!  Oh my God!  You just, you look so different! Terrific! That dress! That body!  Sorry!  Sorry.  Monica, I was wondering if you can make me some of that righteous mac and cheese like last year.  Okay.  Are you all right?  What?  Without my toe?! I need my toe!  That\\'s why I lost my toe?! Because I called you fat?!  That\\'s why for an entire year people called me Sir Limps-A-Lot?!  I can\\'t believe this.  Yeah, well, sorry doesn’t bring back the little piggy that cried all the way home! I hate this stupid day! And everything about it! I\\'ll see you later.  Oh-oh, I\\'m a duck! I go, \"Quack, quack!\" I’m happy all the time!  Nice try.  Look, Monica…  This is not going to work.  You are so great! I love you!  Nothing! I said, I said \"You\\'re so great\" and then I just, I just stopped talking!  No I didn\\'t!  No I didn\\'t!  No I don\\'t! Stop it! Stop it! Stop it! Stop it!  Relax! We\\'ll just get her some antacids.  Oh my God!  Next time, can I say breathe?  Where are you going?  You can\\'t leave me alone with her.  This is exactly the kind of social situation that I am not comfortable with!  It\\'s just that we\\'ve never spent any time, you know, alone together.  Okay.  So, ah... Any plans for the summer?  Hah. May not wanna mention this. So, you ever wonder which is worse, you know; going through labor or getting kicked in the nuts?  Well, it\\'s just interesting. You know, because no one will ever know, because no one can experience both.  One of life\\'s great, unanswerable questions. I mean, who knows? Maybe there\\'s something even more painful than those things? Like this.  Is it really that bad?  I\\'m okay.  Alright. Wow, that is one disgusting miracle.  Wow!  Well, that\\'s spongy.  I know. He has your eyes.  I mean, I know that\\'s not possible, but he does.  Okay.  How do you feel?  Oh, yeah! These are the faces of two people in the know!  Well, gosh. That makes me feel so special and good.  What do we do?  Uh-huh! Join me, won\\'t you?! Okay, what do you say we keep one, and then just like have an option on the other one?  Why not? We could give each of them half a medallion, and then years later, they\\'ll find each other and be reunited. I mean, that\\'s a great day for everybody.  What if they\\'re not? What if it\\'s adopted by a king?  Monica, we are not ready to have two babies!  Okay.  Okay!  Maybe. Unless they\\'re like two people who have lived in apartments next to each other for years, and then one day they\\'re pushed through a vagina and they meet.  Bye!  Have fun at church-camp!  I know! You ready to trade?  Okay.  We could trade later.  Hey.  Her name is Erica.  Yeah. It\\'s a shame you two didn\\'t get to spend more time together.  I love you.  I have no idea what\\'s going on, but I am excited!  We were wondering what was taking so long with the gift, but now we understand you were doing this.  Really? You got us a chick and a duck?  Oh, don\\'t worry, we\\'ll find them.  Alright.  It\\'s okay, it\\'s just an egg roll.  Okay, let\\'s find these birds.  Well, that can\\'t be good!  How?  Oh, tons, I\\'m quite the woodsman.  Joey, wait! The ball!  I don\\'t know. Maybe we can open this up somehow.  No... It\\'s all glued together.  I don\\'t know. Maybe.  I know! It\\'s.. It\\'s the foosball table.  Did that movie ever get made?  And we\\'re also gonna buy you tiny, bird hearing-aids.  What\\'s the matter?  I understand.  Well, I can\\'t do it either.  We have to bust it open, but neither of us can do it!  That was... Impressive.  Sorry about the table, man.  You gonna buy a new one?  Well, at least we got these little guys out.  Aww, we were worried about you! Hm. I guess I better get used to things crapping in my hand, huh?  Hey, you know what? Maybe we should keep them here with you.  Yeah, I mean we\\'ve got a lot going on right now. And, plus, here they\\'d have their own room.  You know, I - I think you\\'re set with the poultry.  I think there may be another reason. So, awkward hug or lame cool guy handshake?  Wow, this is weird.  Where\\'s Ross?  Oh, okay.  Oh, it\\'s gonna be okay.  Sure. Where?  Treeger’s snaking the shower drain.  Hey!  Do we pay for this?  Maybe we shouldn’t pay our phone bill—free phone sex.  Yeah, Joey just pressed something on the remote and it just, came on!  Like finding money with naked people on it!  We don’t know what could make this go away.  And no one touches the air around the TV!  We still have porn.  Or a job where you don’t have to carry a table.  It’s the theme from Good Will Humping.  Oh-oh, yeah, and did he also say that ah, some of the dialogue was corny and that he actually found it was funny and not sexy?  They don’t really talk to us about that kind of stuff. I can get you some free white out though.  Whoa-whoa, wait a minute, did you say, you love her?  All right look, forget it, forget it. You told her you love her, it’s over.  What?  Hi! Listen, can we watch cartoons on your television? We need a porn break. We spent the last two hours watching In & Out & In, Again.  Because then we would be the guys who turned off free porn.  Pregnant Woman Slays Four?  What’s the second part of your plan?  You put your fist through the wall?  A place where no one will ever get out alive?  Are we in London?  Hey.  I was just at the bank, and there was this really hot teller, and she didn’t ask me to go do it with her in the vault.  What, no, \"Nice apartment, I bet the bedrooms are huge?\"  Y’know what, we have to turn off the porn.  All right, ready?  Two.  Yeah, that’s kinda a relief.  You wanna see if we still have it?  FREE PORN!!!  We have free porn here!!!  Pheebs, I don’t understand. How can you have a roommate that none of us know anything about?  Hey-hey! I thought Naked Thursday’s was just our thing man!  Who was it?  Sure!  Well, I like that idea. Obviously! I was thinking maybe-maybe-maybe it could be a game room, y’know? I mean you can buy old arcade games like uh, like Space Invaders and Asteroids for $200, the real ones! The big-big ones!  Okay so you mean no as in, \"Gee Chandler, what an interesting idea. Let’s discuss it before we reject it completely.\"  So, that’s it?  Which is why Asteroids is perfect! It’s the oldest game!  I don’t have anything against the beautiful guest room, especially since everybody we know lives about 30 seconds away!  Nothing, Monica and I had a stupid fight.  Hi.  Really?  Ohh.  That’s a great idea! We can easily think of a way for us both to enjoy the room.  We don’t have to come up with this now.  Hey, y’know what? Why don’t we think about changes we can make in the living room?  Is that a problem?  Oh, that’s cool. Then I’ll just bring them both over.  Okay, I get it. So, I get nothing! Nothing here is mine! Everything here is yours! I’ll get up in the morning put on your clothes, and head off to work!  In the game room!  Why did you take the shower curtain down?  Well, we are fond of the silliness, but we also have a soft spot for the love.  That’s laughter.  I don’t know.  Yeah, I do.  He’s being silly, because he knows that we enjoy the silliness!  Yeah, I\\'m not so worried.  Of course!  Scared me out of ever wanting to live with him.  Okay!  Oh my God! Someone’s killed Square Man!  Oh that’s so sweet! I want to show you something too!  Y’know those big-big uh, road signs that say \"Merge?\"  Y’know? So I was thinking that we could get one of those signs and hang it over our bed. Because, that’s you and I together! Merge!  Really?!  Yeah, it was time. The old condom ring in the leather just doesn’t say ‘cool’ anymore.  Oh yeah, gym member. I try to go four times a week, but I’ve missed the last 1200 times.  You don’t think I’ve tried? You think I like having 50 dollars taken out of my bank account every month? No, they make you go all the way down there! Then they use all of these phrases and peppiness to try and confuse you! Then they bring out Maria.  Oh Maria. You can’t say no to her, she’s like this lycra spandex covered gym…treat.  No!  Oh no, you’ll have to come.  Why don’t you just give him to somebody else?  Because that’s the only part of you he can see when he’s on the table!  No! I want a flabby gut and saggy man breasts!  I wanna quit the gym.  Hey.  No, I almost did, couldn’t leave Ross there without a spotter!  We’re doomed. Okay, they’re gonna take 50 bucks out of our accounts for the rest of our lives. What are we gonna do?  You’re a genius!  Now, there’s two reasons.  Thank you, Joey.  Hi.  No, we’d just like to close them.  I wanna quit the bank!  To pay for the gym.  Hey.  Yeah… Bunny-rabbit.  Oh my God!  Oh my God!! Is everybody getting married?!!  Hey!  Yes! Well that-yes.  We actually missed it.  What?!  Hi!  So, has anyone talked to Dr. and Mrs. Geller yet?  It’s a buffet man.  Listen, I gotta talk to you.  Monica and I almost got married last night.  Look, I just don’t think Monica and I are ready to get married yet! Y’know? I mean, I love her and everything but seeing Ross and Rachel coming out of that chapel was like a, like a wake-up call that Monica and I are moving so fast. Y’know? And, how do I tell her without crushing her?  What?!  Hey!  Are we gonna talk about what you guys did last night? Or…  Well, I think, I think, Ross already has one. Now, this one’s free, right? Because you paid for the first two, so the third one’s free.  I don’t know. But I-I-I know I love you!  So where are we on the whole going back to the place where they have all the marriages thing? I love you.  Sounds great.  Ready!  That was so unlikely. Well, let’s get married! I guess.  That’s right! It was the wrong kind of eight, no wedding! Damnit!  Well you did pull his hair.  I’m not getting into this again!  No!  All right, should we just, should we just get married? Y’know? I mean should we just do it? All the signs are telling us to do it.  Me too!  No!  Well, what if all my stuff was here?  Okay. What if we lived together and you understand what I’m saying?  Me asking is kind of a sign.  Okay!!!!!  Okay.  Oh thanks.  Okay, a little problem. The key broke in the lock and I can’t get in!  This is not a sign!  It’s an old key!  I love you!  Are you hugging the door right now.  Yeah-yeah, me neither.  The key’s stuck in the lock.  Oh.  Nice job Joe! You’re quite the craftsmen.  Ehh, you\\'re just liquored up.  I\\'ve had a very long, hard day.  Ahh, no thanks. No chicken, bye-bye then.  For the last time no! Get out! Get out, Joey!  Are you okay? I\\'m so sorry, he wouldn\\'t leave. He kept asking me about chicken.  Hey Joe!  Yeah, can I get a 3-piece, some cole slaw, some beans, and a Coke-(Yelps in  Hey, Pheebs!  Uh, The Wheatsheaf.  Ooh! Ahh, Pheebs, was gonna tell a story.  I can\\'t believe she can out run you man!  Oh, Ross, when you make out card; be sure to make it out to, EM-I-LY.  Oh that\\'s not true.  Okay, I gotta go to work.  And uh, Rachel, glad to have you back.  All right, y\\'know what, we\\'ve been talking about London too much haven\\'t we?  I got caught up and work, but I\\'m quitting tomorrow.  I was just trying to bring a little culture to the group.  Hey, Pheebs!  Okay, Pheebs, we decided the picnic idea was a little… Y\\'know, it didn\\'t have any… It-it, well it blew. So, we thought, that this afternoon that we would all go away for the whole weekend to, Atlantic City!  Atlantic City!  Pheebs! We have to take you to the hospital now!  I know, it\\'s beautiful. Amazing.  Y\\'know what else I can\\'t believe? I had to kiss Phoebe and Rachel every time I left a room, I mean it\\'s too bad they didn\\'t see us having sex.  No.  Maybe the problem was you were pronouncing it kara-tay.  Sure I would!  What, you guys really think that I’m that shallow?  What if I had had the guts to quit my job? I’d probably be writing for the New Yorker, getting paid to be funny. But my job’s fun too! I mean tomorrow, I-I don’t have to wear a tie.  Oh I just got another rejection letter. They said my writing was funny, just not \"Archie Comic funny.\"  Was his question what’s more boring than him?  Hey, I may have no money, but I still have my pride.  Ehh.  I could use the money; it could give me time to write.  Okay!  All right!  Hey.  Well it’s kinda hard to be friends with Drake because of his busy schedule and the fact that he’s not real.  Uh-oh, it’s my boss!  What?  But the Kit-Kats are all right?!  Phoebe, are you having a heart attack?!  Oh just great. He beeps me now with codes. One is, \"Bring me food.\" Two is, \"I’m with a girl, bring us food.\" Three is, \"I’m lost and I can’t find food.\"  Yeah?  I’m sorry, I guess I just like the pulp.  Okay, anything for you sir?  Who sold a story to Archie Comics?!  Aww.  You wanna share it?  What’s this?  Oh you wouldn’t uh, care. It’s just a stupid comic book story.  No, the doctors say it may kill her.  Listen Phoebe, he’s right. People are not supposed to have heart attacks at 31.  Uh, what about y’know the massage thing? That never gave you a heart attack.  I’m sorry you’re here with me instead of Roger.  Okay.  What was tonight?  Four different women! I’ve had sex way more times!  Nine.  Well good, good for you. You really think that Roger is the perfect guy?  Hey that’s what I tell girls about me.  No you are not! You are sweet and wonderful and this is gonna happen for you.  So was I.  We can’t do this.  I do like that.  Well, if it helps there were only three. So it would just be for tonight, right?  Stop it! We’re doing this! Let’s do it!  I have some moves.  Yeah, let’s just forget it.  Okay!  Oh yeah.  Oh my God!  Hey!  Let me tell you about this chick I scored with last night! Oh no wait a minute that was you!  So you uh, want to do something tonight?  Yeah! Totally! Totally, and you?  I bet he can.  Yeah I know, guess who beeped him?  Yeah! When you were talking about Roger, that was killing me! Look, things like last night they don’t just happen. Y’know? Or at least not to me. Or with the other two women, in the morning y’know I was just lying there and I couldn’t wait to just go hang out with my friends, but with you I always y’know with a friend.  I know you probably don’t want to go out with me, y’know because I make too many jokes and I’ve never been in a serious relationship and I guess I’m not technically a \"doctor…\"  No, there were two.  Oh yeah.  Wow! Pregnancy does give you some weird cravings.  What are you writing?  Hi guys!  Without me?!  Yes, but in Ross’s case, they both know in two weeks that’s it.  Maybe that’s because soy-burgers suck!  What are you talking about?  Like what?  I said, \"Like what?\"  Does for me.  Flashdance.  She was a welder.  What are the odds? What are the odds?  Okay.  Hey.  Oh-ho, yeah!  Hey, you guys!  So, what do you think?  I got glasses!  No I didn’t!  No!  Really?  That’s okay Pheebs, we’re not having a party or anything, so you don’t have to get us…  What we want honey.  Dying people say the craziest things.  Our kids are gonna be fat aren’t they.  Hey! How’s the boat?!  Well, it’s good that you finally have a place to do that.  Do you know what I was thinkin’?  Uh why, do you have a lecture?  Then free as a bird. What’s up?  Well, did-did you correct him?  Oh no problem, maybe I’ll play with my left hand.  Does anybody know me?!  Don’t worry about it Pheebs.  An old cookie?  We can’t accept this.  ‘Cause it’s gross.  Okay, we owe you a present.  I will tell the story! It was going great. I let him win. We were bonding. He even said I could call him dad.  Guys?  I know.  Why do they put so much steam in there?!  Why? Okay? Why? Wh-wh-why did that have to happen?  Not that big a deal? There…there was touching of things.  I don’t want him to tell this story for years.  If that is your father calling to tell this story then the marriage is off!  So you understand, I’d feel a lot more comfortable if you didn’t tell people what happened. Y’know, I’m a little…I’m a little embarrassed about it.  What did you do when they found out?  So I guess we wear swimsuits in here!  Hey, I\\'m sorry, I should have given you guys my black book when I got married! Although it wasn\\'t so much a book as a... napkin. With Janice\\'s phone number on it.  Is Monica not here?  Oh, then I\\'ll tell you. My agency was bidding for a big account and they got it! It\\'s my first national commercial!  Oh... I don\\'t know, I really don\\'t think you\\'re right for the part.  First of all. Bravo. Uh, but I really don\\'t think you\\'re right for this. The part calls for a stuffy college professor.  Software that facilitates inter-business networking e-solutions?  Hey you guys.  Joe, I told you, you\\'re just not right for the part.  Joe...  Fine!  Work, Joe!  He\\'s not right for the part. So if I suggest him, my bosses are gonna think I\\'m an idiot! And that\\'s something they should learn on their own!  Hey Joe!  Bad news. I watched the tape and passed it along to my bosses and they weren\\'t interested.  I\\'m not lying to you, I watched it!  I watched it!  I can\\'t believe Joey. I hate being called a liar!  What did I just say?  Yes, and I have to say, I am not just hurt. I am insulted. When I tell somebody I did something...  Why are you so sure I didn\\'t watch this tape?  He really is a chameleon.  Look, I\\'m sorry I didn\\'t give them your tape. And I promise, next time to submit you whether I think you are right for the part or not.  I know. You\\'re right. What\\'s it gonna take for you to forgive me?  Lying is wrong!  I\\'m a pretty little girl.  It’s your mommy. It’s your mommy.  That was one of the worse things ever. And not just on TV.  And say nothing?  Hi sweetie. So, what was with all the whispering?  Secret? Married people aren’t supposed to have secrets between one another. We have too much love and respect for one another.  No I’m serious, we should tell each other everything. I do not have any secrets from you.  Oh no-no, I can’t do that.  Okay.  So, Ross and I are going to Disneyland and we stop at this restaurant for tacos. And when I say restaurant, I mean a guy, a hibachi, and the trunk of his car. So Ross has about 10 tacos. And anyway, we’re on Space Mountain and Ross starts to feel a little iffy.  That’s it?! I gave up my Disneyland story for that?  What about him?  Hey.  Oh it’s always nicer to here than, \"Aw crap! You again!\"  Hey.  Oh yeah?  Did you not understand the story?  Hey! What’s up?  Huh.  I had too okay?! We’re getting married! Married couples can’t keep secrets from one another!  Du-ude!  Did you not hear me say, \"Du-ude?!\"  In my defense, it was dark and he was a very pretty guy.  Ho-ho, so hard we had to throw out your underwear again?  You wanna tell secrets?! Okay! Okay! In college, Ross used to wear leg warmers!  Ross came in forth and cried!  Hey!!!  That was you!  Y’know when I said that because we’re getting married that we should share everything and not have any secrets?  Yeah that was stupid. Let’s not do that.  Yeah, and not that you would, but I wouldn’t hang out with…all the guys in my office.  We got the honeymoon.  The wedding pictures?  Not the disposable cameras from the tables.  I’ll tell you what, I will go get them developed and you can go home.  What? What did you take a picture of?  Okay Ross has the cameras, has he checked out yet?  Oh.  Score! Where are the disposable cameras?  The cameras? Remember last night I told you to take them?  Yes! Remember? Right before we cut the cake, I went up to you and I said…  So you don’t have the cameras?!  So? What? What? They’re gone! Monica’s gonna freak!  Great.  Hey! Did you find the cameras?  Yes! And that’s why I’m under the table. Celebrating.  Well this is great. Y’know, those cameras were the only thing that was gonna cheer Monica up today, she’s really depressed.  All my energy is going into not asking that question. I can’t believe I screwed this up!  Are you suggesting we dance our troubles away?  Are you serious?  Marriage advice? Really?!  I don’t know, Monica picked out the flowers.  She picked those out too.  That was her.  I was in charge of the cameras! Gift shop?  Who are you? Ansel Adams?! Get outta here!  Why don’t you go up on stage. I’ll get a picture of you doing the speech.  Okay, you ready for the last picture?  We’re back!  It’s picture time.  Eh?  Call it even?!  Oh, yeah! How did you meet her?  Were you so late because you were burring this woman?  All right, who keeps leaving old newspapers in the trash?! I really wanted to take Kathy to this, I can’t believe I missed it.  Really?! I didn’t think girls ever just wanted a fling.  Y’know what? There’s some nice guys at my office, do you want me to set you up?  Well, I have a girlfriend, I’m-I’m happy. So, I no longer feel the need to go out of my way to stop others from being happy.  Oh and Ross was like what? A lion tamer?  Hey, you know what you can do? I remember reading about this director, I think it was Orson Wells, who at the beginning of the movie would hire somebody, just so he could fire them in front of everybody. Then they would all know, who’s boss.  See my friend-my friend, Rachel, she wants to be set up.  Oh, y’know what, that might be okay even if it was just kind of a fling, that might be all right with Rachel.  Oh well, that’s uh, a little later than I uh, generally care to stay, but sure!  Well, I don’t really know what that is, but let’s!!  Wherever! I’ve got like 20!  Y’know what, I’m gonna uh, play the field just a little more.  Guys are signing over their 401-K’s to me?  Yes, and his father invented that magnetic strip on the back of credit cards.  See, I’m not bad at this fixing up thing, huh?  Oh, he works in the Fine Foods division.  It’s a big company, I don’t—if you—I…  Oh yeah! With who?  Yeah.  Hey, man!  Well, like father, like son.  Really?! I-I thought you weren’t looking for something serious? I thought you were looking for some kind of a fling.  Ummmmmmmm, no.  Why not?! I’d be thrilled if I heard that some hot girl was just looking to get—oh I see.  I’m not Jewish, so…  Bad dream?  Oh yeah, then uh, what was Phoebe’s song about?  Prague?  I did! I absolutely did!  I’m sure you’re right, but why?  Oh, man. I’m sorry, I’m so-so sorry.  I know! I know!  Yeah! You graduated Magma Ku Laude, right?  Well, actually it’s a hockey team, so it’s angry Canadians with no teeth.  Have you ever been with a woman?  So there is no good time to ask that question.  Taste it.  Yeah, I know, I did that two minutes ago.  Hey, mister tux!  You\\'re in my seat.  \\'Cause I was sitting there.  Well, it\\'s not like I went to Spain. I went to the bathroom, you knew I was coming back.  The big deal is I was sitting there last, so, that\\'s my seat.  Well, Joey, I wrote a little song today. It\\'s called: Get Up.  Really!  Honey, you did call him back. \\'Cause, it\\'s, it\\'s really old.  Maybe he\\'s calling to say your obsessive and crazy.  Maybe it was his sister\\'s. You know, maybe it was his daughter\\'s.  All right, you will notice that I am fully dressed. I, in turn, have noticed that you are not. So in the words of A. A. Milne, \"Get out of my chair, dillhole!\"  What are you doing?  The cushions are the essence of the chair!  Oh-ho, it\\'ll be back. Oh-ho, there\\'s nobody in the room.  We used them as pillows when we went camping.  He took my essence!  Well, then it looks like somebody is gonna have to give back somebody his cushions.  What are you, what are you gonna show me my clothes?  He\\'s got nothing!  What are you supporting?  Monica, I think you\\'ve gone over to the bad place.  They got a phone in there, right?  Is it wrong that I was totally aroused by that?  Oh my God! That is so not the opposite of taking somebody\\'s underwear!!  Oooo-ooh!  Jeez, what a baby.  Stop it. Stop it!  Excuse me. Hi.  Well, your kind of sitting in my seat.  I mean, I was sitting there.  But, I never left the room!  All right, that\\'s it, give me your underwear.  First of the month.  No, just the months you actually want to live here.  That’s our phone number. Now look, I know I kinda sprung this whole me moving out on thing, so why don’t I just—why don’t I just cover you for a while?  It’s not charity, Joe…  Uh, yeah.  So, we’ll do the rest of the bills later then?  No, I hope not! I tried to offer him some money, but he wouldn’t take it.  I figure that $1,500 would cover him for a few months, y’know? But I have to trick him into taking it so I won’t hurt his pride.  Well that would help the pride thing.  Hey! Wow! You look great! Wanna move in with me tomorrow?  Hey!  Well, instead of just hanging out, we figure we’d do nothing.  Oh nope, I-I have plans with Joey.  Yes, but for the last time.  He’s at a dinner party.  Oh, I wish I’d know you were going to do that, I ordered Chinese.  Say, Joe, I had a strange idea of what we could do for our last night. What do you say we play a little uh, foosball for money?  Yes it would. What do you say to $50?  Okay, let’s play! The big game, Italy vs. China, apparently.  Okay, give me a chance to win my money back. Okay? Sudden death, one goal, $1,000.  Oh yes!  Okay.  See? Now, that’s why only the little fake men are supposed to do all the kicking.  Still broken?  Okay, uh, how about, how about—y’know what? We could play a new game. A new game, it’s fun.  Cups.  I’ll teach ya! Come on, come on, it’s really easy and really, really fun.  Ho-ho, you win! 50 dollars!  You’re kidding right?  You win.  It doesn’t matter because nothing beats a three and a six. That my friend is D-Cup. Okay, now much have you won so far?  Not 700 exactly?  Well you see in Cups, once you get $700, you have to double it.  What’s wrong?  Wh-How did you lose at Cups?!  Oh man!!  All right, let’s play one more hand! One more!  I can’t take the big white dog! You love it!  When did I try to give you money?  I’m just trying to help you out! Okay? I wanna make sure that you’re okay.  Sure!  I invented the game of Cups as a way to give Joey money.  Exactly.  It’s not a real game! I made it up!  At a fake game!!  Okay! Now I assume the Saucer card came up when you played last.  Okay, well tonight’s the big night.  It is going to be perfect. I am taking her to her favorite restaurant. I’m going to get her a bottle of the champagne that she really loves; therefore knows how expensive it is. Then when the glasses are full, instead of proposing a toast I’m just gonna propose.  Yeah.  I’m not gonna mess it up.  She’s not gonna say no.  Hey!  Phoebe!  Hey!  I just get mad when Rachel doesn’t remember where we’re going.  Well, you could also give back the money you owe me.  Oh, so you’re already doing your part for the kids.  Wait a minute, all jokes aside? I didn’t agree to that!  Okay, now will you guys get out of here? I want this is to be a surprise and she’s gonna know.  Yes! Yes! I’m good! Are you good? Are you good? Is everything—are you—are you perrr-perfect?!  Yes! I’m fine. In fact I’ve been fine for a long time now and I think, the reason is you.  Okay umm, before I meant you I had really little life and I couldn’t imagine growing old with…  Hi.  I got a good one, I got a good one! I once walked in on both my parents making love to the same guy.  What?!  Richard!  Oh you knew that. Good!  For camp!  Hey, you have to forget about Elizabeth. I mean if you’re not careful you may not get married at all this year!  Richard was there so I couldn’t do it!  I’m gonna do it tomorrow y’know, and-and surprise her, but now you’ve ruined it!  Who walks into a room and asks to see a person’s hands?!  This is terrible. What am I going to do?  That’s right, I can throw her off. I can make her think marriage is the last thing on my mind.  I can do that, I’ve had 30 years of practice.  Hey!  Yeah, well… Y’know, it just got me thinking though, why would anybody ever want to get married huh?  Eh…  Sure I do. In fact, I think the whole concept of marriage is unnatural. I mean look at pigs. Let’s take a second here and look at pigs. Okay pigs don’t mate for life. I mean a pig can have like a hundred sexual partners in a lifetime, and that’s just an ordinary pig not even a pig that’s good at sports!  If marriage worked, I’d be all for it. But do you know what the divorce rate in this country is? 97%.  Well, never say never but y’know probably uh yeah, never.  Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! What is all this pressure?! Is this some new kind of strategy? Why don’t you put down your copy of ‘The Rules’ huh mantrap?!  I was making a coconut phone with the professor.  What?!  My—Oh my God!  He’s not supposed to ask my girlfriend to marry him! I’m supposed to do that!  You’re right.  Okay great.  What?!  Well where did she go?  Oh my God, I can’t believe this! Y’know, I thought…I thought you were a good guy.  Nothing happened? Nothing? So you didn’t tell my girlfriend that you love her?  Y’know what? I can’t believe this! Do you know what you did? My girlfriend is out there thinking things over! You made my girlfriend think!!  And what does she have to think about? I love her!  But I am willing to offer her all those things. This was just a plan, y’know? A way to throw her off course so that when I offered her all these things, she’d be surprised!  Y’know Richard…you are a good guy.  I can’t talk to you now, I gotta find Monica!  What?  What are you talking about?  Well why didn’t you stop her?! Why didn’t you just tell her it was a plan?!  Well where… Where did she go?  I can’t believe I ruined this.  Oh my God.  I\\'m sorry!  Rachel, wait, wait.  Can I just say one thing?  That\\'s a relatively open weave and I can still see your... nipular areas.  Okay.  No, she\\'s still upset because I saw her boobies.  It was an accident. Not like I was across the street with a telescope and a box of donuts.  Y\\'know, I don\\'t know why you\\'re so embarrassed, they were very nice boobies.  Whoah whoah, back up there, Sparky. What\\'d you mean by that?  Huh.  Uhhuh, how did you know that?  Y\\'know, I don\\'t see that happening?  Well I\\'m not showing you my \\'tat.\\'  Oh, it\\'s nothing, it\\'s a little thing... I hate that guy.  Oh look, it\\'s the woman we ordered.  Uh, Joey\\'s having an embolism, but I\\'d go for a Nip, y\\'know?  Joey, if I go first, I wanna be looking for my keys.  So, who\\'s up for a big game of Kerplunk?  C\\'mon, I\\'ll show you to my room. ...That sounds so weird when it\\'s not followed by \"No thanks, it\\'s late.\"  Hey, Kicky. What\\'re you doing?  Well, you\\'re gonna.  Are they end to end, or tall like pancakes?  Hey, you\\'re not him. You\\'re you. When they were all over you to go into your father\\'s pipe-fitting business, did you cave?  No. You decided to go into the out-of-work actor business. Now that wasn\\'t easy, but you did it! And I\\'d like to believe that when the right woman comes along, you will have the courage and the guts to say \"No thanks, I\\'m married.\"  Yeah. I really do.  Get off!  Sorry, my my thing was in there with me.  Basically we just feel that he\\'s...  Things sure have changed here on Waltons mountain.  If I turn into my parents, I\\'ll either be an alcoholic blond chasing after twenty-year-old boys, or... I\\'ll end up like my mom.  So, you and Rachel tonight, huh?  Wow! So tonight may be the night! You\\'re nervous?  What must it be like not to be crippled by fear and self-loathing.  How can you be so confident?  Really? Like you have a routine?  Really?  ...and beer!!  Hey! Stop staring at my wife\\'s legs! No no! Stop staring at your sister\\'s legs!  She went on one of those spray-on tan places.  Sure, then you should get a mini skirt so you can really show it off.  Hey Pheebs!  Who\\'s Amanda?  Are you trying to do a British accent?  Just so I know, how many more of those can I expect?  No, had it done to me though. Feels good !  Hello? Is someone on the line?  Hold on! There is something different.  Was that place... The Sun?  Oh My God! You can do a duet of Ebony and Ivory all by yourself!  How was your date with Joey?  You didn\\'t like that?  If she asks, I protested a little, but ok!  Well, aren\\'t you a treat.  That fake British woman is a real bitch, but she sure can dance... Hey!  Kinda... you know, sneaking around, having to hide from you guys...  Actually, no. No, it felt right. You know, it felt like uhm... I can\\'t believe we haven\\'t been doing this the whole time.  Dude, it\\'s Chandler. Let me in.  I know, I went to the tanning place and the same thing happened to me. You have to let me in.  No, I just had to get a picture of this.  I see you later!  Die Hard still great!  What’d you rent?  Yeah, I just got uh, got plans.  No, see the thing is I want to get out of here before Joey gets all worked up and starts calling everybody bitch.  That’s sweet.  So uh, what did this woman look like?  Well, is there any chance you were looking into a bright, shiny thing called a mirror?  Julie Grath, my camp girlfriend.  Well, ‘cause she came back the third summer and she’d gotten really fa-aa-aw-ow…  I did not say fat! I said, \"Fa-aa-aw-ow…\"  Yeah. Yeah, but it was a really, really long time ago! Does she still feel bad?  Can you figure out what I’m doing?  Who?  Because you kept talking to him while he was trying to go to the bathroom?!  What? Are you kidding? That was like 16 years ago.  Okay, I will do it. But I have to warn you; this may make me a better person and that is not the man you feel in love with!  Ah, uh, I owe you a long overdue apology. I never should have broken up with you because you were overweight.  As bad as that went I actually enjoyed myself. I think that I’m going to apologize for all of the stupid things I do.  I would really love it if could do both.  What?  What?!  A hundred and forty-five pounds.  Look I know it was a stupid reason to break up with somebody, but I was 15!  Okay. Okay, now wait a minute that was totally different.  You were not supposed to hear that! I said that behind you back!  So you can balloon up or you can shrink down and I will still love you.  I’d carry you around in my pocket.  Skidmark’s still got a way with the ladies.  You can always spot someone who\\'s never seen one of his plays before. Notice, no fear, no sense of impending doom...  No, ten o\\'clock.  She\\'s amazing! She makes the women that I dream about look like short, fat, bald men!  Oh yeah, and what would my opening line be? \\'Excuse me. Blarrglarrghh.\\'  Oh please, could she be more out of my league? Ross, back me up here.  Thank you, buddy.  Y\\'think?  Oh God, I can\\'t believe I\\'m even considering this... I\\'m very very aware of my tongue...  Hey, kids.  Well, I can\\'t believe I\\'ve been here almost seven seconds and you haven\\'t asked me how my date went.  It was unbelievable. I-I\\'ve never met anyone like her. She\\'s had the most amazing life! She was in the Israeli army...  Alright. Once I got on the subway, right, and it was at night, and I rode it all the way to Brooklyn... just for the hell of it.  We talked \\'til like two. It was this perfect evening... more or less.  Oh, I\\'m sorry, so \\'we\\' is?  Who\\'s Rick?  Oh, so you\\'re divorced?  Oh, I\\'m sorry, then you\\'re widowed?...Hopefully?  So tell me, how do- how do you think your husband would feel about you sitting here with me?...Sliding your foot so far up my pant leg you can count the change in my pocket?  Ethan? There\\'s, there\\'s an Ethan?  So explain something to me here, uh, what kind of a relationship do you imagine us having if you already have a husband and a boyfriend?  ...Hm.  What \\'not work out\\'? I\\'m seeing her again on Thursday. Didn\\'t you listen to the story?  Well, y\\'know, I had some trouble with it at first too, but the way I look at it is, I get all the good stuff: all the fun, all the talking, all the sex; and none of the responsibility. I mean, this is every guy\\'s fantasy!  Are we greeting each other this way now? \\'Cause I like that.  Thank God you didn\\'t try to fan out the magazines. I mean, she\\'ll scratch your eyes right out.  Someone\\'s left a glass on the coffee table. There\\'s no coaster. It\\'s a cold drink, it\\'s a hot day. Little beads of condensation are inching their way closer and closer to the surface of the wood...  Oh no, it\\'s terrific, it\\'s... it\\'s... y\\'know, you deserve this, after all your years of struggling, you\\'ve finally been able to crack your way into showbusiness.  Where\\'s Joey? His mom\\'s on the phone.  Oh, that would be Monica. Hey, listen, I wanna borrow a coupla things, Aurora spent the night, I really wanna make her breakfast.  God, I love these fingers...  No, actually I meant my fingers. Look at \\'em, look at how happy they are.  Don\\'t go.  Well, I thought- I thought you talked to Rick.  What, Ethan? He got to spend the whole day with you!  I know there\\'ll be many moments in the years to come when I\\'ll regret asking the following question, but- And Andrew is?  Oh, so what you\\'re saying is you\\'re not completely fulfilled by Rick, Ethan and myself?  Well, y\\'know, most women would kill for three guys like us.  You.  Nono, just you.  Lose the other guys.  C\\'mon, we\\'re great together, why not?  ...Well, y\\'know, part of me wants that, but it\\'s like I\\'m two guys, y\\'know? I mean, one guy\\'s going \\'Shut up! This is great!\\' But there\\'s this other guy. Actually it\\'s the same guy that wells up every time that Grinch\\'s heart grows three sizes and breaks that measuring device... And he\\'s saying, y\\'know, \\'This is too hard! Get out! Get out!\\'  I don\\'t know, I-I have to listen to both of them, they don\\'t exactly let each other finish...  ...The second guy.  Sorry, the first guy runs the lips.  Something so sweet and...disturbing about that.  Do you think you could get through a poem?  Too?  That’s great!  So great things are happening at work and in your personal life!  Don’t do it.  I think it’s the dying cat parade.  Y’know that thing that Ross was gonna do at our wedding?! He was hanging out with me yesterday and he turned to me and said, \"You’re half Scottish right?\"  Yes!!  Why is your family Ross?!  If you listen very carefully, I think its Celebration by Cool and the Gang.  Well, I feel like a snack!  Oh no thanks. I don’t like any thing from my Scottish heritage.  We heard you play all the way from your apartment!  That’s not really important right now. What is important is; while we appreciate the gesture, we just don’t feel bagpipes are appropriate for our wedding.  Because we hate them.  We have heard you play.  Hey!  So we thought we\\'d throw you little going away party around seven.  Where\\'s your passport?  Well, it\\'s not.  We\\'re taking a break!  Jumping on the bed?  No, no, no, guys. She\\'s right. We should get to work. I\\'ll take stuff out of the closet, Joey you pack \\'em and Ross you re-pack whatever Joey packs.  I didn\\'t know Monica had these!  Why would she use them with Richard and not me? I can be kinky! I once did a naked dance for her... with scarves!  Hey.  Yes, Joe?  Oh, yes. I decided to leave these out for you in case Richard stops by and you wanna engage on a little light bondage and moustache play!  Oh yeah, right! Good luck getting another scarf dance from me!  Really? Then what are they doing in our guestroom?  Uh, Rach?  No, no, no... They\\'re really yours. We... found them in your old room.  Don\\'t say Richard! Well, if they\\'re not Monica\\'s and they\\'re not yours, then whose are they?  Pheebs!  I think these are yours.  Let me just say something... Because once we get into this, I\\'m gonna get all uncomfortable and probably make some stupid joke... I just want to say that I... I love you... And, I\\'m gonna miss you. And I\\'m so sad that you\\'re leaving.  I\\'m sor... Just go. Just go. I can\\'t, I can\\'t.  Oh, you\\'re definately not. I haven\\'t cried like that in years.  That old woman was being scammed by her mechanic.  Mine was a humdinger  Well, you can\\'t say we don\\'t know how to throw a party.  Joey and I can finish up in the guest room.  Hey Mon, I think I figured out whose handcuffs they are.  Well, I was cleaning out the closet and I found some pictures of them... being used.  Monica\\'s grandmother.  Relax! We just get her some antacids.  Oh my God!  Honey, it\\'s gonna be okay.  What?  There\\'s a hair in my coffee.  You know, it\\'s funny. Every time you say \"triplets,\" I immediately think of three hot blonde 19-year olds.  So, a lot of malfunctioning wee-wees and hoo-hoos in this room, huh?  I mean, you have a lovely home.  You want me to wash my hands first, don\\'t you?  Hey, you must be Owen.  I\\'m Chandler. Hey, I was in the scouts too.  Yeah, in fact my father was a den-mother.  You know how to use a compass?  You do? That\\'s fantastic!  I\\'d love to, but I gotta get back to talking to your parents. They\\'re telling us all about how they adopted you.  What?  I got nothing.  Where are Bill and Colleen?  We have to leave!!  I didn\\'t get to the bathroom. I bumped into Owen on the way, and he didn\\'t know he was adopted. And there\\'s a slight chance I may have told him.  But kids are so intuitive. Don\\'t you think on some level he already knows?  See? Intuitive!  Which technically now you should give back!  I\\'m so sorry, but you should have a sign out there or something. Or at least whisper it to people when they come in the door. \"Owen doesn\\'t know he\\'s adopted, and he also thinks that Santa is real.\"  Owen didn\\'t know he was adopted, and Monica told him.  Yeah, but how would you like it if someone told the triplets that you gave birth to them?  Okay.  Hey!!  Oh that’s right. It’s your first day! So are you psyched to fight fake crime with your robot sidekick?  Are you judging them by their covers? Because you’re really not supposed to do that.  Hey!  Wait a minute, hold the phone! You’re not Elizabeth’s dad?!  Ross!  There’s a Mr. Bing!  Yes, we were just…  Hey honey, you got the kind with the little girl, you said we were gonna to get the kind with the baby.  No, the little girl creeps me out.  Why would the baby creep me out?  This is going in your book?  Hey!  Damn those robots, they’re supposed to be our faithful servants!  So do you think uh, Joey’s more charming than me?  Who?  Hmm.  Oh.  Oh-oh.  We said seven!  The only way that I said six would be if the seven’s, let meet at seven, not at six.  Oh my good God.  What?!  Thank you for writing your book. Its-its uh, great book and you are the queen of everything.  So you knew we were gonna miss the movie!  Oh I’m so sorry man! Is there anything I can do?  Hi, how are ya?  Yeah, I’ve been there my friend.  Sorry man.  Did they teach you that in your anger management class?  Oh, we had a lot of liquor left over from the Christmas party.  No, sir.  What?  Oh, that was my work laugh.  Oh, believe me, to survive this party, you\\'re gonna have to come up with one too.  Okay.  Hey! Everybody at work loved you last night!  Okay, easy Martina. I think we should let them win the next game.  Let them win one.  You\\'re not even giving them a chance!  Oopsey, missed it!  It was my racquet.  If we hadn\\'t lost the game they never would\\'ve invented us to dinner tomorrow night.  Okay y\\'know what, because you said that, I\\'m not putting out tonight.  Just a little bit of sugar.  Oh, you get used to it.  So I laugh at my boss\\'s jokes, what\\'s the big deal?  What?  Well, I-I just didn\\'t think it was funny sir.  Well, I just…  Really?  But we\\'re not ready to tell yet!  Man, she is really gullible.  Okay.  Why would I be mad?  I also want you to remember that I let you live here rent free!  Wait. Before we go in, I just want you to know I love you. I had a great time on our honeymoon, and I can’t wait to go in there and spend the rest of our life together.  They’re terrific, and they live right here in the city.  I’m sorry, we’re just kinda excited because we finally have a couple to hang out with.  Listen, they are really great. If you just got a chance…  We really…didn’t get a chance to…  Ross! It’s got your wavy black lines!  Y’know who has a great video camera?  Let’s call ‘em.  What?  I don’t know! You were a delight to talk to. You asked all those insightful, great questions.  I still don’t get it, we didn’t do anything wrong.  I thought you said those jokes were funny. Joke! Joke! Joke!  Well maybe it was all of your questions.  The sheer volume, it was like flying with the Riddler!  Did you do it on our invitations?!  That’s the magic story you use when you wanna have sex!  Jenny! That is so Jenny!   No way!  Yes, yes, we did, thanks to Vidal Buffay.  Ok, I think she\\'s trying to tell us something. Quick, get the verbs.  Well, listen, don\\'t tell us what\\'s gonna happen though, \\'cause I like to be surprised.  Hey, Rach, can I get...  Not yet.  So what the hell happened to you in China? I mean, when last we left you, you were totally in love with, you know.  God?  Well, maybe it was God, doing me.  Well, you owe me one, big guy.  He said...he said, he said that they\\'re having a great time. I\\'m sorry. But, the silver lining, if you wanna see it, is that he made the decision all by himself!  Without any outside help whatsoever.  You have to really wanna see it.  No, no, I\\'m just looking for a man to draw on me with chalk.  Okay.  You have to stop the Q-tip when there\\'s resistance!  Ok, I don\\'t care what you guys say, something\\'s bothering her.  What stupid thing did you do?  People do stupid things when they\\'re upset.  Well, in spite of the yummy bagels and palpable tension, I\\'ve got pants that need to be altered.  Are you sure he\\'s gonna be able to crack that code?  At least as long as I have the pants.  Joey\\'s tailor...took advantage of me.  Oh come on! He said he was going to do my inseam, and he ran his hand up my leg, and then, there was definite...  Cupping.  Come on, Monica, things could be worse. You could get caught between the moon and New York City. I know it\\'s crazy, but it\\'s true.  That\\'s ok.  Yeah Ross, I mean... we\\'re excited to hear the speech but the rest of the time we\\'re gonna wanna do, you know, \"island\\'s stuff\".  Yeah, that\\'s the same as \"it has something to do with wind\".  I wouldn\\'t read too much into it.  David, let me stop you there \\'cause I think I see where this is going. I\\'m not very good at giving advice. So if you want advice, go to Ross, Monica, or... Joey, if the thing you wanna advice about is pizza toppings or burning sensation when you pee.  Seriously, we\\'re gonna do this?  What?  I didn\\'t mean now...  Well, you\\'re welcome! Glad I could help.  David, I\\'m pretending to read here!!  David is going to propose to Phoebe.  Be-cause, we were talking about ways that he could beat Mike and I told him that Phoebe wanted to get married.  I did! A penis one! Look, just so I know, what was so wrong about what I said?  Man, that\\'s some bad advice!  That\\'s why our honeymoon photos look like me and Diana Ross!  David is going to propose to Phoebe tonight!  That would be advice!!  Oh, is it on the computer, cuz I\\'d love to give it a read...?  Your computer, I don\\'t know wha... everything\\'s gone!  It must be a virus. I think it erased your hard drive.  Someone I don\\'t know sent me an e-mail and I opened it.  Well, it didn\\'t say \"This is a virus\"!!  It\\'s not gone! I mean, I\\'m sure you printed out a copy. You have a hard copy, right?  Well, you must be pretty mad at yourself right now...!  I just feel awful.  Phoebe is going to say \"yes\"? That\\'s, that\\'s great!  And there\\'s not chance that will work?  This vacation sucks!!  You know, it\\'s very hard to take you seriously when you look like that.  I wouldn\\'t brag too much about that thing, big guy.  Oh, ain\\'t this nice? It\\'s so quiet, I could just lie here all day.  I\\'m so glad we\\'ve got adjoining rooms!  Hey! Remember when I had corneas?  Ladies? Ross\\'s speech is in 45 minutes.  I don\\'t think so!  Because you know how competitive you get and well, I say it\\'s cute, others disagree, and I\\'m lying!  Oh, yeah? What happened when we played last time?  And...?  I\\'m not playing with you.  Honey, try to focus the trash talk on him!  I think this is the first time in our marriage that I\\'ve felt like the more attractive one.  Okay-dokay, you\\'ve each won a game and I\\'ve lost what\\'s felt like a year of my life. So everybody goes home a winner.  Should I use my invisibility to fight crime or for evil?  Monica, that was also true an hour ago! I mean, please, look at you! Your hand is blistered, you can barely stand, your hair is inexplicable! Ok, you\\'ve already proven you are just as good as he is, now we\\'ve missed our dinner reservations, so now let\\'s just go upstairs, order room service, take a shower and shave your head!  But...  What about the obsessive cleaning?  You ok?  No, you didn\\'t.  Because I\\'m gonna play for ya.  All right Mike, let\\'s get this over with. Sudden death. Whoever wins this point, wins.  And that\\'s... how... it\\'s done!  I never sucked, I actually didn\\'t want you to know how good I was!  I don\\'t know.  That\\'s why!  Mr. Millionaire, new from Snooty Playthings! Third wife sold separately.  Life-sized Imperial Storm Troopers from Sharper Image?  Wow!! Can Joey and I put them on and fight?  Yeah, either that, or Gloria Estefan was right, eventually, the rhythm is going to get you.  And you’re our age. You’re our age.  That’s not a state Joe.  You’re our age!  Is there any chance you didn’t see that?  Ross! You gotta stop! Okay?! You can’t just stare through the peep hole for three hours! You’re gonna get peep eye!  You didn’t just break up.  You slept with somebody three hours after you thought you broke up. I mean bullets have left guns slower!  Okay.  And the inventor of the door rests happily in his grave.  Stop what?!  No!! You can’t!!  Look man!  She’s moving on! Okay, if it’s not this guy, it’s gonna be somebody else! And unless you’re thinking about subletting my peep hole, you are going to have to get used to the fact that the relationship is over! Okay, man? It’s over.  Okay.  Ah, Sliced Bread, a wonderful Lady MacBeth.  I think somebody has a crush on somebody.  I’m talking about you. You big, big freak.  Hey, you have nothing but talk about her for the last 48 hours! If you were in a school yard you’d be pulling her pigtails and pushing her down now!  ‘Cause it’s-it’s not his last name.  No, it’s not like, like Phil Spiderman. He’s a spider, man. Y\\'know like ah, like Goldman is a last name, but there’s no Gold Man.  So, ahh, what kind of powers would Gold Man have?  What about things that are already gold?  Okay, let’s play my game now.  Hey! Wow, it is true what they say, pregnant bellies look like a drum.  All right.  Wouldn’t that be Frank the III?  Hey! Do we have a baby name yet?  Well, it certainly worked for that Valdez kid.  Well, Chandler will be there for you too. I mean, well, he might be a little late, but-but, he’ll be there. And he’ll bring you some cold soda, if want you need him for is that you’re really hot.  Hey!  And now you’re giving me the message!  You actually think that something can happen between Emily and Susan?  Hi! Hi! You’re crazy! Okay? This is Emily. Emily is straight.  Raymond Chandler.  Okay, there are no famous Joey’s. Except for, huh, Joey Buttafucco.  Okay, look, Joey! Come on, think about it, first of all, he’ll never be President. There’s never gonna be a President Joey.  Wow, you’re, you’re right. I have a horrible, horrible name.  Okay.  No, no, you’re right, it is a ridiculous name!  Yes it is! From now on, I have no first name.  I have no name.  Okay uh, for now, temporarily, you can call me, Clint.  Okay, so what name am I cool enough to pull off?  It’s Clint! Clint!  All right look, am I serious, okay? Tomorrow at 3:30 I am going down to the courthouse.  Hey, look, this name has been holding me back my entire life. Okay, it’s probably why kids picked on me in school, and why I never do well with women… So, as of 4 o’clock tomorrow, I’m either gonna be Mark Johnson or John Markson.  Okay. Thanks.  You wanna hug it out?  Yay!  Okay!  Bye, Pheebs!  Ha! Ha! Ha!  Ross and the most beautiful girl in the world.  Okay, but that\\'s, like, the easiest era.  Hi. You guys have any wrapping paper?  Phebes, it was your birthday, like, months ago.  Well, I have a call in about that.  Actually, this is for Kathy\\'s birthday. It\\'s an early edition of her favorite book.  Okay, but don\\'t touch it, because you fingers have destructive oils.  Oh, it wasn\\'t a big deal. I just went to a couple of bookstores, talked to a couple of dealers... called a couple of the author\\'s grandchildren.  It doesn\\'t say that. Does it?  Okay, all right, I\\'ll just uh, make sure that uh, Joey gets her something really great.  I don\\'t know... um, Grease?  Rent?  Okay, so when do you want to go?  Yes, it is, at Office Max.  A pen.  Huh-huh! You can\\'t give her that.  Because she\\'s not eleven! And it\\'s not the seventh night of Hanukkah!  All right, look, look. What did... what did you get for Angela Delveccio for her birthday?  For three years?  All right. I will go out and I will try to find something for her, okay?  Would you like me to write her a little poem as well?  Okay, all right. I just spent the entire afternoon looking for a present for Kathy that would be better than the rabbit.  She\\'s really going to love this, you know? The bottom line is I want her to have it, even if I don\\'t get to be the one who gives it to her.  Yeah? You don\\'t think it\\'s just pathetic?  Where?  No, it\\'s a book that\\'s just a book, okay? It\\'s an early edition of the Velveteen Rabbit. It was her favorite book as a kid. So, uh, just... let me know if she likes it, okay?  No, it came out to an even twenty.  Hey, how\\'d it go? How\\'d she like the gift?  Oh yeah? That\\'s great!  Hey! Happy birthday.  Happy birthday! I\\'m sorry.  See, you think it\\'s just a pen, but then you turn it over and it\\'s also a clock.  Oh, yeah... yeah.  Oh, uh, yeah... I just knew that sometimes when you\\'re writing, you... you don\\'t always know the exact time.  Uh, the book?  What do you mean?  Oh, yeah, he\\'s my... he\\'s my best friend.  You know, I once dated a Miss Crankypants. Lovely girl, kinda moody.  Monica, will you stop? This is nuts. Do you know how long it\\'s gonna be before you actually have to deal with this problem? I mean, you don\\'t even have a boyfriend yet. Joey, she does not look fat.  We\\'ll watch him.  I was looking forward to playing basketball, but I guess that\\'s out the window.  You understood that?  Is he the one with the beautiful wife?  You know, I don\\'t think we brought enough stuff. Did you forget to pack the baby\\'s anvil?  No, I got him.  Oh, seriously you want him?  Well, don\\'t, don\\'t think me immodest, but, me?  Well, we are great guys.  That\\'s a good plan, Joe. Next time we wanna pick up women, we should just go to the park and make out. Taxi, taxi!  Ok, but can you tell him that, because he thinks he\\'s too pink.  You done?  You know it?  Oh, sure, they love us over there.  Oh, that\\'s good. Maybe he\\'ll hear you and pull the cord.  That\\'s me.  Please tell me you know which one is our baby.  Ok.  Yeah?  Hey, Ben, remember us? Ok, the mole came off.  What\\'re we gonna do? What\\'re we gonna do?  Oh, we\\'re gonna flip for the baby?  All right, call it in the air.  Heads it is.  We have to assign heads to something.  What kind of scary-ass clowns came to your birthday?  You, you are gonna love this.  Stay back, I\\'ve got kiwi. Run, Joey, Run!  …Come on! Why are we here?!  The hot chicks?  Wow that’s actually pretty cool.  Sounds like two people are really enjoying the Dewey decimal system.  You didn’t bring me here to do that, did you?  OH…MY…GAWD! I am so sorry sweetie, are you okay? You didn’t tell her we were getting married, did you?  Did she freak out?  Right.  You said no right?!  Lie!!! How hard is that?! The check’s in the mail! Oh your baby is so cute! I can’t wait to read your book Ross!!  What do you think she’s just gonna sit there quietly? You don’t think she’s gonna want to make a toast? You don’t think she’s gonna want to grab the microphone and sing Part-time Lover?!  Y’know what? It’s gonna be okay. Y’know what? She’s probably not gonna even want to come.  No! That was a lie! See how easy that was?  Yes!!  Yes!!!  Well actually uh, there was something we wanted to tell you about the wedding. Um, it’s going to be a small ceremony. Uh, tiny! We’re not even sure why we’re having it.  I say we go with Careless Whisper.  Aren’t you just a tinsy bit curious?  No-no-no-no, if we let her stay, she will stay forever!  Is that what you’re thinking about right now?  Janice, I’m sorry but umm, you can’t stay here tonight.  Honestly? Our apartment is a hotbed for electromagnetic activity. Now Monica and I have been immunized, but sadly you have not.  Say again?  Feelings, such strong feelings.  If I was a superhero who could fly and be invisible, that would be the best.  What a wank!  See, that’s why I could never be an actor. Because I can’t say gig.  Knock, knock.  Okay, well it this bed isn’t new, how come there is plastic on the mattress?  You told him to play the boxer gay!!  You totally screwed him over.  What?! What are you talking about?  Who’s the father?  Why not?  As in Barbara Streisand’s husband James Brolin?  Y’know I am the groom right? I was told it was kinda big deal.  Before we go out there I’ve got a present for ya.  No?  I’ve been taking dancing lessons.  Yeah, the last six weeks. I wanted this to be a moment you will never forget.  So? Would you care to join me in our first dance as husband and wife?  I don’t know, it’s these new shoes, they’re all slippery.  Not well.  Thank you.  Bravo Dennis thanks for pleasing my mother so.  What size shoes do you wear?  Great, because my shoes are giving me a little problem on the dance floor, can I borrow the boots from your costume?  And the world will never know.  Yes, I told him how talented you were. I told him all about Days Of Our Lives.  But you’re not just a soap actor. You are a soap actor with freakishly tiny feet.  Did it turn into sand?  Why?  Wait a minute, wait. You’re telling me this actress person is the only woman you ever wanted who didn’t want you back?!  My Grandmother used to say that exact same thing to me.  Hey.  Yes, I realise that.  Thanks, it’s ah, Gaelic, for ‘Thy turkey’s done.’ So ah, I’m gonna go, nice, nice meeting you.  Hello.  Oh, I\\'m glad you guys are past that little awkward phase.  Oh-ho, liked what she saw, huh? Dug my action, did she? Checkin’ out the Chan-Chan man!  Yeah, she seemed cool, attractive. I’ll do it.  Well, the movie was great, dinner was great, and there’s nothing like a cool, crisp New York evening.  Of course, I didn’t get to enjoy any of that, because Joanna’s such a big, dull dud!  That’s what you say at the end of a date.  To her face? Look it’s the end of the date, I’m standing there, I know all she’s waiting for is for me to say ‘I’ll call her’ and it’s just y\\'know, comes out. I can’t help it, it’s a compulsion.  Multiple, so many paper cuts.  Look, you can’t call somebody after this long just to say, ‘In case you didn’t notice, I don’t like you!’  Nooo!! She’s really dull! And she gets this gross mascara goop thing in the corner of her eye!  All right! Fine! But it’s just a lunch date, no more than an hour! And from now on I get my own dates, I don’t want you setting me up with anybody ever again!  That’s just a lot of big talk, y\\'know.  The food there was, was great.  So take care.  Noo!  Look, I’m sorry. Okay? I’m weak, and pathetic, and sorry.  Ahhhh—I’m not going to call you.  Yeah, o-okay.  Well this is great! I’ll give you a call! We should do it again sometime!  Hey Eddie. Daahh!! What\\'re you doin\\' here?  Why?  I can\\'t sleep now.  No, look, that\\'s it, it\\'s over, I want you out, I want you out of the apartment now.  Hannibal Lecter...better roommate than you.  I didn\\'t realize that.  GET OUT NOW!!  Yes please.  I want you out.  Where did you hear it from before?  Ahhhh-gaaaahhh. Eddie what\\'re you still doin\\' here?  Look Eddie, aren\\'t you forgetting anything?  Maybe \\'cause the last one was made by Pepperidge Farm. Look Eddie, isn\\'t there something else you\\'re supposed to be doing right now?  Look you have to help me out here. I thought we had a deal. I thought by the time...  Your last roommate\\'s kidney?  Daaahhhh!  Why must everybody watch me sleep? There\\'ll be no more watching me sleep, no more watching.  Uuuh.  Get out. Get out, get out, get out, get out, get out, get out.  You, move out. Take your fruit, your stupid small fruit and GET OUT!  Uh-huh.  This is not out of the blue, this is smack dab in the middle of the blue.  You want some help.  Yes, yes I actually saw him leave. I mean that guy is standing in the window holding a human head. He is STANDING IN THE WINDOW HOLDING A HUMAN HEAD!  Our next cocktail party?  Eddie, do you remember yesterday?  Do you remember talking to me yesterday?  So what happened?  Oh sweet Moses.  May I help you?  Yeah, he\\'s lived here for years, I don\\'t, I don\\'t know what you\\'re talking about man.  Well I, I think we\\'d remember something like that.  Absolutely.  Ah that\\'s a cantelope.  Hey look, are we gonna have to bring this out every time Ross comes over?  I\\'m gonna hold him a different way. Look I don\\'t understand, if you hated it so much, why did you buy it in the first place?  So is he housetrained or is he gonna leave little bathroom tiles all over the place? Stay. Good, STAY! Good fake dog.  Dehydrated Japanese noodles under fluorescent lights... does it get better than this?  Ah, y\\'see, perfect might be a problem. Had you said \\'co-dependent\\', or \\'self-destructive\\'...  Yes please.  He\\'s a he?  ...Couldn\\'t enjoy a cup of noodles after that. I mean, is that ridiculous? Can you believe she actually thought that?  You did?  Huh. Did, uh... any of the rest of you guys think that when you first met me?  You\\'re kidding! Did you tell her I wasn\\'t?  Well, this is fascinating. So, uh, what is it about me?  Ross is smart and funny, d\\'you ever think that about him?  WHAT IS IT?!  Oh, oh, a quality, good, because I was worried you guys were gonna be vague about this.  I just have to know, okay. Is it my hair?  Hey, gorgeous.  No, nono, don\\'t- don\\'t worry about it. Believe me, apparently other people have made the same mistake.  So, uh... what do you think it is about me?  ...Quality, right, great.  Lowell? Financial Services\\' Lowell, that\\'s who you saw me with?  Well, yeah... \\'s\\'no Brian in Payroll.  No! Uh, I d\\'know! The point is, if you were gonna set me up with someone, I\\'d like to think you\\'d set me up with someone like him.  Excuse me? You don\\'t think I could get a Brian? Because I could get a Brian. Believe you me. ...I\\'m really not.  Well, don\\'t we look nice all dressed up?...It\\'s stuff like that, isn\\'t it?  Nothing, just your overcoat sounds remarkably like Brent Mussberger.  You\\'re watching a football game at a funeral?  You are a frightening, frightening man.  Oh, no-  Hi, I\\'m Chandler, and I have no idea who Dorothy is.  Hey.  Who are those people?  Hey, Lowell.  So how\\'s it going there in Financial Services?  Good, good. Listen, heh, I dunno what Shelley told you about me, but, uh... I\\'m not.  Really.  So- you can tell?  So you don\\'t think I have a, a quality?  He is?  Or... Dick.  Was it like a sneeze only better?  No!!  No, it\\'s... fancier than a pimple. Look Ross, why don\\'t you just go see a…  Okay, well, it\\'s definite, two more weeks of winter.  Hey!  Well, y\\'know if Joey and I played with matches we could get you up to an even hundred.  You\\'re right, I know.  Y\\'know what? You should go to my guy, because when I went in there with my third nipple. He just lopped it right off. Y\\'know? So I guess I\\'m lucky. I mean not as lucky as people who were born with two nipples.  Well, if he\\'s gonna break up with you, maybe Joey and I should water his plants. If y\\'know what I mean.  Well sensitive is important, pick him.  So, what do you thing the good news is?  Yes, but this is Pete. Okay? He’s not like other people, on your first date he took you to Rome. For most guys that’s like a third or fourth date kinda thing.  Oh, so you’re going with the teacher, huh?  Honey, you\\'re screaming.  Hey!  Yeah, he came up...  Monica says that her Maitre D. is the funniest guy she\\'s ever met.  Yes! Am I crazy to be this upset?  Yeah!  Hey!  What are you guys talking about?  Oh yeah? Is he funnier than me?  I do limericks... uhm... There once was a man named Chandler, whose wife made him die inside.  Well, I\\'m off to Tulsa, so if your Maitre D. friend has any funny Oklahoma jokes, tell him to e-mail me at www.hahanotsomuch.com.  Really...? See... that\\'s the thing: you gotta keep it smart, people!  That\\'s what\\'s weird? Joey, the man\\'s been captain of a cereal for the last 40 years.  Waaa-aaah.  The spoon. You licked and-and you put. You licked and you put.  Mine is the red one! Oh God. Can open, worms everywhere.  Because soap is soap. It\\'s self-cleaning.  Hey.  Excuse me, you guys are getting tattoos?  Wow, that\\'s lucky. What if her name was Big Ugly Splotch?  Oooh, Rich is goin\\' to the party too, huh?  I know, this is a great apartment.  Wow, there\\'s my fantasy come true. No, seriously.  Oh please, I saw the way you were checking out his mouldings. You want it.  Well it wouldn\\'t kill you to say it once in a while.  What?  Woah, woah, woah. I don\\'t need a roommate either, OK? I can afford to live here by myself. Ya know, I may have to bring in somebody once a week to lick the silverware.  Look, you know what? If this is the way you feel, then maybe you should take it.  Well then maybe you should take it.  Fine with me.  Hey.  Yeah me too.  Yeah. So do we need to hug here or. . .  Lick away my man.  What?  No-no, I mean what, what\\'s this about your new place?  Well, there you go.  Hey, no, I\\'ve never been lower or wetter. I\\'ll be fine. I\\'ll just turn your, uh, bedroom into a game room or somethin\\', you know, put the foosball table in there.  I did pay for half of it.  Alright I\\'ll tell you what, I\\'ll play you for it.  Your little men are gonna get scored on more times than your sister.  So, uhh, em, you want me to uh, give you a hand with the foosball table?  Thanks.  Yeah, right, yeah, I guess so.  Well, I\\'m guessing uh, tonight at the coffee house.  Yeah.  The British are coming?  Ohh.  Why?  Yes! Chandler Bing, 7! Chandler Bing, 0.  Okay, I\\'ll stop.  You wanna play?  Well, so, play for the next 30 minutes and then write until he gets home.  I\\'m intrigued.  Okay, but be careful okay, because I wanna get our security deposit back.  Do you even remember which part of the wall is not spackle?  Well, why can\\'t you do them tomorrow?  The only reason you\\'re doing this to Joey is because you\\'re bored. Okay, it\\'s not his fault that you\\'re unemployed.  Oh, so being a good friend means acting like a total jerk?  I paid for those tickets!  When did that happen to you?!  Oh yeah. First off all, chasing the Churo guy isn\\'t jogging.  I don\\'t believe they\\'re brother and sister.  Oh hey! There\\'s some kids playing in the street, you wanna go down there and give them a project, ruin their day?  Yeah or also when you don\\'t have somebody breathing down your neck ALL THE LIVE LONG DAY!!  What is up?  No, it was me. I\\'m sorry. I over reacted.  I am sorry, Ross.  This took you all day?!  See, now, why would you assume that? Just because we\\'re married? I will have you know that we are very hip, happening people. Now, if you\\'ll excuse me, I have to get back to reading the obituaries.  Wow.  Well, I think it\\'s great that you\\'re going on a date, you know? I mean, it sounds healthy. I mean, you have needs. Embrace your womanhood!  Emma? Emma? Look at me! Well, I think I\\'ll go downstairs for a while.  No, no, no, no! No, no, no, no! It\\'s okay, it\\'s okay. I didn\\'t go. Don\\'t cry, it\\'s just a bit! I\\'m your uncle Chandler; funny is all I have!  I don\\'t do that.  I\\'ll try to stop. Wait, did you say until the sixth?  Today is the sixth.  Yes, it\\'s also 2003.  It\\'s okay. Go take the test and see if we\\'re okay.  Tough crib.  I might have checked to see if I was ovulating a couple times.  I am not working. There\\'s not much to do around here!  Oh, good, because as of four o\\'clock this afternoon, I am not.  I - I don\\'t think I can.  Because of Emma.  Sorry.  Well, she\\'s aware when we leave the room. She may notice if we start... canoodling in it.  Well, I can\\'t say \"hump\" or \"screw\" in front of the B-A-B-Y.  Horrifying? Scarring? Something people go to jail for?  You guess I\\'m right? When we stayed at that bed and breakfast, you wouldn\\'t have sex with me because you thought a deer was staring through the window.  Emma was doing it!  Ooh, she\\'s asleep, that means we can...  I think we may have really done it this time.  You may wanna get some more of those too.  Where\\'s Emma?  Don\\'t ask me, I was in there canoodling you!  All right, all right, we were. We were trying to make a baby. Monica\\'s ovulating.  No, no, no.  What? Why?  Your family name is Tribbiani.  I could fall asleep at a play.  Hey!  Yes, but, Ross you chose a career of talking about dinosaurs.  Where the hell is everybody?  I... I don\\'t know... you seem lovely.  Well you should be. You missed the most powerful three hours in the history of the theater.  Oh yeah, I had no idea the amazing journey you go through as a woman! Tell me, tell me about your first period!  Did somebody sign your bra?  Oh well, this was a really important experience for me, and I wanted to share it with you.  Hey!  You look great. I\\'m so glad we\\'re having this rehearsal dinner, you know, I so rarely get to practice my meals before I eat them.  No stupid jokes. I thought that was for the actual wedding.  Heh.  Thank you.  I know, I hate being left out of things.  Fine. We\\'re just sitting here. Alone. Doing nothing. It\\'s our rehearsal for tomorrow.  What happened?  Pick me, I look great in a tux and I will not steal focus.  Oh, I will. But I will need a mirror... as he is me!  You are going downer!  Mike didn\\'t tell you? You have to chose one of us to be in your wedding. One of his groomsmen fell out.  Just not enough to put us in the original wedding party.  Hey, can I talk to you about this groomsman thing? If you pick Ross, he\\'ll walk you down the isle just fine. But if you choose me, you\\'ll be getting some comedy!  How\\'s it going?  You too.  Me too.  I\\'m not supposed to tell you.  Rach, Rach, knock knock.  I\\'ll tell you at the wedding.  So technically, would this person be in the wedding?  Ready?  Okay.  Wow! Aren\\'t you gonna be cold?  You look beautiful.  That really was an incredible wedding.  I\\'d love to, but it\\'s 2300 hours and I\\'m about to have the most organized sex anyone\\'s ever had.  I don\\'t know. Maybe he hooked up with that hot girl he was talking to.  Tell me what?  Wow!  More importantly, was I any good?  You\\'re okay there?  I\\'m sorry, it was a one-time-thing. I was very drunk and i was somebody else\\'s subconscious.  Hello Rachel.  Pirates again?  Well, you know Phoebs. I don\\'t know if it\\'s your kinda thing, because it involves a lot of being normal. For a large portion of the day.  A cool phone number, and a possible name for the kid.  When we were?  Whoa! And this manchild has no problem with how old you are?  Can you hear that?  See that\\'ll stop when you pick up the phone.  I\\'m not in a meeting. I\\'m right... Whoops.  What?  Ah!  Well, now, I actually have to get to work.  Okay.  Bye bye.  Why not?  What?!  Noho. Who doesn\\'t they like me?  What are you talking about?  I can\\'t belive it.  They do me?  I don\\'t sound like that.  Okay, I don\\'t sound like that. That is so not true.  That is so not... That is so not... That... Oh, shut up!  Oh, come on. You told me about the last dream.  Oh, why not. Was I doing anything particularly... saucy?  And this has nothing to do with the fact that he needs a note to get out of gym.  Tyrannosaurus!  Work people? Nobody told me.  You know, I don\\'t get this. A month ago, these people were my friends. You know, just because I\\'m in charge doesn\\'t mean I\\'m a different person.  You think I should?  Okay.  Okay.  I Think last night was great. You know, the Karaoke thing. Tracy and I doing Ebony and Ivory.  What?  Then, I don\\'t get it.  They do?  I just wan\\'t to...  But I just wa...  Thanks. Listen, about the weekly numbers, I\\'m gonna need them on my desk by nine o\\'clock.  You have to give \\'em something, you know. Okay, now that was Gerston, Santos, and who\\'s the guy with the moustache?  Petrie, right, right. Okay, some people gonna be working this weekend.  Yeah, like in a cab...  Okay, hating this.  Here we go, here we go.  Hey-hey-hey. So what happened? A forest tick you off?  Yeah!  You’re building a post office?  Does anyone else think David Copperfield is cute?  All right, Janice, likes him. In fact she likes him so much she put him on her freebie list.  Well, we have a deal, where we each get to pick five celebrities that we can sleep with, and the other one can’t get mad.  Ah, Kim Basinger, Cindy Crawford, Halle Berry, Yasmine Bleeth, and ah, Jessica Rabbit.  I know, I know, I just always wondered if I could get her eyes to pop out of her head.  Peter Parker.  Hi.  We don’t, really.  You know, we don’t really take advantage of living in the city.  No, you didn’t get me!! It’s an electric drill, you get me, you kill me!!  I do NOT want this unit!!  All right, so who do you got it narrowed down to?  Oooh-hoo, very attractive, forgiving.  Eh, y\\'know what, she’s to political, she probably wouldn’t let you do it, unless you donated four cans of food first.  Ooh-hoo. Very hot, very sexy. But ah, y\\'know she’s too international, y\\'know she’s never gonna be around.  So, you gotta play the odds, pick somebody who’s gonna be in the country like all the time.  What’s going on?  Yo!! Spackel boy! Get up!  He started mine first!  What, like a number?  Okay, on three. One....Two....  Why two?  Yeah, I coulda counted to three like four times without all this ‘two’ talk.  Okay, one...two...  Oh, good job Joe.  Yeah-yeah, so big that it actually makes our doors look smaller!  Umm?  I’ve got five bucks says you can’t.  Oh, I think I have the cash.  Hey.  Yeah, we were gonna give fifty, but if you guys gave more, we don\\'t wanna look bad.  And twenty-five it is.  Phoebs, let me ask you something, were, were these, uh, funny brownies?  Which is why geese are so relaxed this time of year.  What\\'s in the bag?  Nah, Phoebs, that\\'s the guy that comes in the frame.  Ya know I remember my father, all dressed up in the red suit, the big black boots, and the patent leather belt, sneakin around downstairs. He didn\\'t want anybody to see him but he\\'d be drunk so he\\'d stumble, crash into something and wake everybody up.  Who said anything about Christmas?  So whaddya got there Monica?  Don\\'t you have to be Claymation to say stuff like that?  Yeah, she, she brought the invisible cab. . . hop in.  Hey, don\\'t worry. I figure it\\'ll be 2 hours to Phoebe\\'s dad\\'s house, they\\'ll meet, they\\'ll chat, they\\'ll swap life stories, we\\'ll still have plenty of time.  Hey.  Eeeshk.  OK.  Oh, so that\\'s what this is for.  Yeah.  Alright.  Alright, we\\'re gettin\\' closer.  Well, so why not go knock?  Yeah, and someday when you\\'re ready, you\\'ll make it past the hedges.  Oh, that\\'s OK, we\\'ll figure something out.  Ho, ho, ho, holy crap is it hot in here!  OK, Phoebs, your turn.  And, a lemon lime.  And last but not least.  Yep.� That\\'s a lot of cats Jo Lynn.� Single are ya?  Chandler Bing.  What\\'s up Joe?  Braid each other\\'s hair and ride horseback on the beach?  Courtside?� Oh my God.  That\\'s so cool.� I\\'ll let Monica know.  Joey just called.� He\\'s got courtside Knicks tickets for him and me tomorrow night.  I know.� You\\'re right.� I want to see you too.� I\\'ve just got to figure out a way to tell Joey, you know?� He\\'s really looking forward to this.  Yeah, ah, ah . . .� I\\'ll think of something.  Hey.  Well, it looks great.� It\\'s just that . . . well, I\\'m wearing the same thing underneath.� So . . .  Because I didn\\'t know how to tell him that I couldn\\'t go to the Knicks game.� So, I just told him that I had to stay in Tulsa.  Yah.  What? Why?  Look I, I can\\'t.� What\\'s going on?  NO!  No! Wait!  Is that really necessary?  All right.� I\\'ve got a plan.� I\\'ll go down the fire escape.  Hear me out woman.� I\\'ll go down the fire escape.� Then, I\\'ll wait for a while.� Then, when I come up the stairs, it\\'ll be just like I just got back from Tulsa.� Then, Joey and I will come in and see that there\\'s no guy in here.  I\\'m just going to wait for a little while.  It\\'s huge.  That\\'s right.� You\\'re husband\\'s home.� So, now the sex can stop.  Joey said that you\\'re in here with another man.  All right.� Well, I\\'ll check the guest room.  There\\'s nobody here Joe.  I\\'m sorry.� I, I told you I was in Tulsa because I wanted to spend the night with Monica and I, I didn\\'t know . . .� I didn\\'t think you\\'d understand.  Yeah.� I feel so bad.� Is there anything I can do to make it up to you?  I\\'m sorry. �That\\'s the one thing I can\\'t do.� I promised I\\'d be with Monica.  What?  Really?� You\\'re gonna be okay?  You\\'re gonna put on sweats and clean, aren\\'t you?  Okay, bye.  Hey, listen.� I\\'m never going to lie to you again, okay?� And I want you to know that nobody thinks you\\'re stupid.  Game\\'s tomorrow night Joe.  Okay.  Hiya doin\\' pumpkin?  So, what are you gonna do?  Me?! Why me?  I\\'ll try, but I\\'m not sure what good it would do, y\\'know? Because I\\'m a lot less afraid of commitment than I used to be.  Gary, I\\'m here to report a crime.  It is a crime that you and I don\\'t spend more time together.  Well, I heard that you thinking about asking Phoebe to move in with you and I thought maybe, we should have a talk. Man to uh, me.  Uh, are you crazy? Are you insane? If you live with Phoebe, you two are gonna be y\\'know, live-living together!  You mean scared.  Scared? Happy?  I am trying to open your eyes, my man! Don\\'t you see, if you lived with Phoebe she\\'s always gonna be there. You\\'re gonna get home, she\\'s there. You go to bed, she\\'s there. You wake up and oh yes, she\\'s there!  Were you\\'re parents happy, or something?  Wow, y\\'know when you say it, it doesn\\'t sound so scary.  Yeah, I think I do! Y\\'know what? You move in with her! You move in with her right now! Maybe I should in with Monica!  Hi!  Yes I did, and I think you should do it.  He\\'s a great guy, y\\'know? And he loves you a lot, you are a very lucky lady.  Hey Gar!  Four hours? You guys have been doing this for four hours?  What?  I\\'m not a dropper!  It\\'s throwing and catching!  Maybe that\\'s because she\\'s a minion of the anti-Christ.  Yeah, you almost overreacted to something.  Not fun anymore?  Come on! Gary\\'s such a great guy! Whatever the problem is, you can work it out!  Oh that is over!  You guys wanna eat here?  Oh yes.  Hi there!  That.  Hey Rach, now that you\\'re working at Ralph Lauren, can you bring me back some of those polo shirts?  Unwilling to steal from work, interesting.  Dude! That\\'s my girlfriend!  Yeah, it is the best.  Yeah, or you can do the easy thing and smoke.  Yeah, I wanna go to babe.  Ah sure. What\\'s in \\'em?  Oh good, because uh we got Rachel 800 gallons of water.  Y\\'know I rued the day once…didn\\'t get a whole lot else done.  Okay, there\\'s something different though--Oh my God! You smoked!  Yes you did! You look happy and sick; you smoked!  I wish I had smoked for my career…  Okay, but you gotta push past this because it is about to get so good!  Great job with the cups, Pheebs!  Awesome!  Okay, great.  Our eyes are closed and we’re about to cross the street. Very good.  No-no, I don’t think you heard me. Are you ready to party?!  Kathy’s with her parents, I have nothing to do, so tomorrow we are partying with Gandolf dude!  I’m gonna call and get off work tomorrow!  This is gonna be soo cool, dude, we never party anymore!  Oh man! I am so excited—I may vomit!  Look you don’t understand, Gandolf is amazing. Y’know you’re never know what’s gonna end up happening, you go out for a couple of beers and end up on a fishing boat to Nova Scotia!  Oh yeah, it’s beautiful country up there.  It’s not gonna be exactly like last time.  Whoa-wh-wh-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa!  He’s not gonna make it, he’s stuck in Chicago.  Stupid, useless Canadian money!  Yeah, and I-I gave first names to all of the foosball players.  Oh-no, y’know with Gandolf we’d be out all night!  And may-maybe we could end up on a boat again?  All right!!  Remember that really cold morning, you woke up and those dogs were licking your face?  Well, those were seals, man.  Yeah, all right.  Actually, me too.  Actually, can I get some hot water with a little lemon? I think I strained my voice screaming in there. Does it have to be so loud?  Y’know what? We’re not sad, we’re not sad, we’re just not 21 anymore. Y’know? I’m 29 years old, damnit! And I want to sit in a comfortable chair, and watch television and go to bed at a reasonable hour!  Is that gal pal spelled L-O-S-E-R?  Nice work my friend.  And a bagel with only…  Well, I see you\\'ve had a very productive day. Don\\'t you think the cowboy hat is a little much?  Y’know what, we have to turn off the porn.  All right, ready?  Two.  Yeah, that’s kinda a relief.  You wanna see if we still have it?  FREE PORN!!!  We have free porn here!!!  What’s wrong with you?  This sounds like a hernia. You have to—you-you—Go to the doctor!  That’s still in there?!  Stick to your side!  Mento?  Thanks.  Well this one\\'s for you.  That\\'s what they\\'ll call us.  It hurts me. It physically hurts me.  You’re turning into a woman.  Now I’ve upset you? What did I say?  Oh my God, introduce us!  Aren\\'t you supposed to be at an audition for another hour?  Sorry.  Hello!  Okay, but don\\'t you think this is a little extreme?  Yeah I know, we\\'re losing Ross, Joey said hence…  You\\'re on in 5 Ms. Minnelli.  So you\\'re really okay with this?  Now that\\'s so funny, because last Christmas I got the gift of space. We should get them together and make a continuum.  Okay, what is in here? Rocks?  So, rocks.  Look, we just think that maybe she\\'s being a little unreasonable.  Kind of? If you just kept this to yourself none of this would\\'ve happened.  Well, I think it\\'s very brave what you said.  Pheebs, what are you doing with the coat? How about the whole animal rights thing?  Uh, Ross?  Yeah, we are so sorry.  Hi!  Oh yeah, there-there she is!  Oh my goodness! Where did you hide it?  Pheebs you didn’t have to get us anything for our wedding you already sang…  Oh, okay.  I kinda like it here.  Well what did it do?  A vending machine?  Who cares? It’s a stupid game.  I don’t suck. It’s sucks. You suck.  Why do you want to play this game so bad?  You are not going to believe what I did today!  Well I’ve been playing it for like eight hours, it’ll loosen up. Come on, check out the scores. Oh, and also look at the initials, they’re dirty words.  Because it’s awesome.  Well y’know, they only give you three letters, so after A-S-S it is a bit of a challenge.  It is when you put it together with that one.  Come on, he won’t even know what they mean.  Have you talked to him lately?  With the claw?!  All right! Go left! Go left! Go right!! Go right!!  Hey.  I’m so sorry.  I have a job interview I have to get ready for.  And people say you don’t pay attention. No, this is a much better job. It’s vice-president of a company that does data reconfiguration and statistical factoring for other companies.  That’s what I do now.  The front page? You really do live in your own little world, don’t ya?  Well, I got a job interview. It’s kinda a big deal too. Its a lot more money and I’d be doing data reconfiguration and statistical factoring.  Me! I do that. So… Seriously, do I look okay? I’m little nervous.  Why not?  What about it?  Are you serious?!  What is it that I do?  I can’t even believe this! I really come off that badly?  Oh good. Good, because I’m sure this interview is gonna last a couple of weeks.  An hour.  Phoebe!  Chandler Bing.  …I think you’ll find if I come to work here, I don’t micro-manage. I don’t shy away from delegating.  Hardest thing I’ve ever done in my life.  Really?  Okay.  …also I was the point person on my company’s transition from the KL-5 to GR-6 system.  That I did. That I did.  No don’t I beg of you!  Oh my God this doesn’t count! Okay? The interview was over, that was the real Chandler Bing in there, this is just some crazy guy out in the hall! Call security! There’s a crazy guy out in the hall!  Yeah, I don\\'t know why we hang out with married couples more often.  A dinosaur died a million years ago?  YOU NEVER DID IT!  Hey! I will have you know that... aah, who am I kidding. Let\\'s call the kid Geller and let Bing die with me.  Mrs Hannigan?  Hey Joe! We\\'ve got a couple of things we\\'ve got to check out at the new house. You want to come with us?  Yeah, come with us. You\\'ll see how close it is to the city.  Damn it.  That\\'s what we were gonna name the baby.  Hey, how\\'d the interview go?  You know, I always feel that way after an interview. I\\'ll bet it went better than you think.  That is a bad interview.  Ooh! Israeli champagne. And it\\'s vanilla!  To Ross!  And thank you for explaining to us what escrow means... I\\'ve already forgotten what you said, but thank you.  What?  When your head was hanging out the window, it didn\\'t hit a mailbox, did it?  Man, those two dogs are going at it!  Hey.  Really? What changed your mind?  Joey, there was a little girl who lived here, but she died like 30 years ago.  Ha! I\\'m just messing with you.  You don\\'t think we\\'d buy a house and not have a Joey room do you?  Excuse me?  For your information, I was staring at her baby. We\\'re about to be parents.  How did the job stuff go?  That\\'s great!  …betrothed couple.  Hey!  Pheebs?  Skull?  How long have we been home?  Lovely!  Hey, you know what I was thinking? When we get married, are you gonna change your last name to Bing?  Why not?  Hey!  Ohh! You guys gonna be living together again?  Well, she\\'s just so much fun with Joey, I just assumed, she\\'d still be living with him.  No reason, except…she…told…me.  No! No, she didn\\'t say that. I-I-I think you should talk to Monica now.  Bing doesn\\'t seem so weird now, does it?  Forty-five minutes? We have tickets to the Musicman at 8:00.  Is this because of the burrito thing?  Give him money? It was a joke!  Right, calm down, O\\'Mally. I\\'ll slip him some money.  How do you know so much about this?  Richard used to do it, didn\\'t he?  Mustached bastard…  Hey Pheebs!  If you wanna give Joey a Christmas present that disrupts the entire building, why not get him something a little bit more subtle, like a wrecking ball, or a vile of small pox to release in the hallway?  Well, I\\'m here to see my old buddy Ben. What are you doing here, weird…turtle-man?  What?  You called everyone and said you were having trouble finding a Santa costume, so I borrowed one from a guy at work!  Why?  But I didn\\'t get to shape my belly like a bowl full of jelly.  Fine, I\\'ll give the suit back.  Santa? Really?  Did your Dad ever dress up like Santa?  Well, I\\'ll stay, but only because I wanna hear about Hanukkah. Ben, will you sit here with Santa and learn about Hanukkah?  Oh yeah, but don\\'t worry. I don\\'t think anybody\\'s gonna focus on that as long as your wearing that towel dress.  All right, I suppose I can wait a day. Hey, what are you doing Friday?  I need you to come to this bachelor party for my weird cousin Albert, y\\'know he\\'s the botanist.  Yeah. Is that a dinosaur tie?  Well apparently Albert has no friends. He\\'s very excited about the bachelor party though. I think actually the only reason he\\'s getting married is so he can see a stripper.  Well, if the magician can open my beer with his but cheeks, then all right.  I want to say you but, that seems like such an easy answer.  I\\'ll get you the Cliff Notes.  The abridgment.  ....three years of modern dance with Twila Tharp! Five years with the American Ballet Theater?!  Oh no, no, no, no.  Okay, we have our stripper. A miss Crystal Chandelier.  Bye-bye.  What, what, what?!  You really think that is what he meant?  Look, don\\'t you see what\\'s happening here. Instead of hitting on her right away, he\\'s becoming her confidant. Now he\\'s gonna be the guy she goes too to complain about you.  Well, why don\\'t you send her a musical bug, op, no you already did that. All right look, you\\'re going to have to go there yourself now, okay, make a few surprise visits.  All right fine, don\\'t do anything, just sit here and talk to us, meanwhile she is talking to him about you. And he\\'s being Mr. Joe Sensitive, and she starts thinking \\'Maybe this is the guy for me, because he understands me.\\'  He paints quite a picture doesn\\'t he?  Y\\'know what, I\\'m, I\\'m gonna spend some alone time with the pen.  Oh, okay Ross. Listen, this pen is kinda getting boring, so can you pick me up some porn?  Yeah. Either that, or you just turned him on and sent him off to a stripper.  Oh no-no-no, I’m, I’m paddling away!  Wow! Really?! We get all this rusty crap for free?!  Could we be more white trash?  Hey uh, Rach, funny story. I ah, bumped into Joanna on the street yesterday.  Well, no, actually she uh, asked me if I wanted to get a drink.  Well, not at first.  Well, I think I judged her too quickly, and this time we were able to take the relationship to the next level.  Oh, come on! It’s not like this is an everyday occurrence for me! I mean usually I’m pretty much just in there by myself.  Okay, I promise, I’ll end it.  I hope you know what I’m giving up for ya, because she’s not just the boss in your office, if you know what I mean.  It just doesn’t…feel like we’re breaking up.  Okay.  Thanks.  I’m getting dressed.  When I walk outside naked people throw garbage at me.  What is it?  You are, you’re gonna leave me like this?  How little?!  Look, this isn’t funny! You get back here right now!  Why not?!  What?!  Okay, here’s the situation. The keys to the cuffs are on the back of the door. Could you be a doll and grab them and scoot on over and unlock me? And on a totally different subject, that is a lovely pantsuit.  I did break up with her! She just took it really, really well!  It did enter my mind! But then something happened that made it, shoot right out.  Never!  Fine!  I—never borrowed your Walkman.  About what?  I’ll make something up! I’m good at lying, I actually did borrow your Walkman!  Oh-ho-ho, I don’t think so!  Well, this is much better.  Hey, look, you’re in trouble either way! Okay? If she comes back and sees me locked to this instead of the chair, she’s gonna know you were in here. So you might as well just let me go.  Freedom!  No!  With extra pulp?  No!  You don’t have it.  How do Monica and Phoebe know?  And Milton Berle has a…  I think so.  Could there be more Kims?  Oh, I\\'m going on the lamb.  Well, I think, I think Ross knows about me and Monica.  Look, we\\'re not just messing around! I love her. Okay, I\\'m in love with her.  Yeah, big zero gravity moon steps.  Hey listen, come on, Joey is having a problem! A little girl is beating him up.  Very, very funny, but don\\'t say things like that in front of Monica. I don\\'t want you putting any ideas in her head.  Wh-wh-why?!  Yeah, so, what\\'s that supposed to mean?!  I don\\'t see it that way. Okay? Because, I see two Monicas, the one that was my friend, who lived across the hall, and wanted to have a lot of babies and then the new Monica, who I just started to date. Now, who\\'s to say what she wants?! I’m right. I\\'m right. Am I right?  Okay. It\\'s not different at all, is it?  Hmm.  Yeah, I\\'m cool. Casual.  I\\'m just hanging out. Y\\'know, having fun. Y\\'know with the girl that I\\'m seeing casually.  What?!  Well, you do want all that stuff, right?  Yes! You want babies! You have baby fever!  Oh please, you are obsessed with babies and-and marriage and everything that\\'s related to babies and-and marriage! I\\'ve got an idea, why don\\'t we turn down the heat on this pressure cooker?!  Nah-uh! I know you! Okay? I know the thoughts that you have in the head--in your head!  Well, I did not know that.  It\\'s gonna be okay, right? I mean she\\'s not gonna leave me? This is, this is fixable.  By me?  Just tell me what I need to do to make things right.  Well, that\\'s what we do. Y\\'know, I-I mess up and then you tell me how to fix it and then I do and then y\\'know you think I\\'m all cute again.  Where\\'s Monica?! Where is she? I need to talk to her! It\\'s urgent! Is she here?  I need to talk to you, it\\'s urgent!  Will you marry me?  I don\\'t know. But I know I\\'m not afraid to do this.  I\\'m doing this because I\\'m sorry?  Yeah, I\\'m kinda wishing everyone wasn\\'t here right now.  I didn\\'t think I was!  Okay, how long is this going to go on.  That\\'s not funny.  That\\'s funny, we were doing the same thing!  Yeah it is really pricey. I mean, I freaked when I first heard the numbers.  It was pretty simple actually, I came up with a couple of cost-cutting solutions, wrote out a list and Monica told me to go to hell.  Hey!  Our adoption social worker is coming by today so we are cleaning the apartment.  You know you don\\'t want me to help. You can\\'t have it both ways!  Kind of. She\\'s coming by to interview us and see where we live.  What...? NO!  I\\'ll admit to the cigarettes and the magazine, but that tape is not mine.  Ok, ok, here we go.  But you already gave all your money to charity!  I don’t think you can do that!  That’s sweet, honey, but save something for the adoption Lady.  Oh, because we love kids. Love ‘em to death.Well, not actually to death, that\\'s just a figure of speech - we love kids the appropriate amount... as allowed by law.  But other than that... wholesome, wholesome building.  What?  Of course it was!  RAT BASTARD!  Oh, it\\'s just some crazy guy who roams the halls here. He\\'s great with  Oh, just like I said. That crazy... Bert... roaming the halls. (Joey bangs on  WE\\'LL TALK TO YOU LATER, BERT. EVERYTHNG\\'S FINE!!  Oh yeah! He has a caretaker. His older brother... Ernie.  What the hell are you doing?  Well, we\\'re not.  We don\\'t have a code word.  Ok!  What?  I can explain... Joey...  Oh, that\\'s really ok.  Wrong number?  That\\'s great!  Hello...? Have you seen Joey\\'s bat?  That is lucky.  Now-now, why would you say that Joseph?   Oh, ok.  Oh no, it\\'s terrific, it\\'s- it\\'s- y\\'know, you deserve this, after all your years of struggling, you\\'ve finally been able to crack your way into show business.  Oh, are we playing this?!  Hey! How’d the audition go?  So it did go well.  Oh that’s great!  Oh my God!  Oh-oh, what are you doing?  Well, it is overdue.  Yeah okay, I was just talking to the guys. Just look at them I mean, is it okay if they come visit?  As crazy as soccer?  You mean you didn’t get it from this?  Well, maybe we can fix it y’know? Maybe we can send him some-some big-big flowers and scare him!  I messed up. Okay? I’m sorry, I really messed up.  Which I bought for ya. Taught ya how to use it. You thought it was a copier. Look, if there was anything I could do, I would do it. Okay? But everybody’s allowed one mistake, right?   You know he coulda gotten me a VCR, he coulda gotten me a set of golf clubs, but no, he has to get me the woman repeller!  The eyesore from the Liberace house of crap!   Yeah, I mean when you were late last night, Kathy and I got to talking, and one thing to another and…   No! No! No! I just kissed her.   How is that worse?!   You’re right, I have no excuses! I was totally over the line.  Look, I’m not saying that you should magically forgive me! But you’re not perfect! You’ve made some errors in judgment too!   What the hell happened?!! How were you locked in?!! And where the hell is all of our stuff?!!   So--You got in voluntarily?!   BEND OVER?!!!  Ok, now, remember, no trading. You get the pretty one, I get the mess.  ...And what did you bring?  Janice?  Janice?!  Joey\\'s tailor...took advantage of me.  Oh come on!  He said he was going to do my inseam, and he ran his hand up my leg, and then, there was definite...  Cupping.  I can’t believe I did this! What an idiot!  Do you think he’ll ever forgive me?  Y’know what? I-I kinda have.  You didn’t see how mad he was, y’know?  Oh my God!  Please tell me you got the message!  The actor playing Mac couldn’t do it, they needed to see you at 2 o’clock.  Du-du-I wrote it, I wrote it on the board! I wrote it on the board, then I went all over New York City looking for ya! I went to Ross’s! I went to the coffeehouse! I went to any place that they made sandwiches!  Sorry! I-I-I don’t know what to say.  Y’know, sometimes that fake out thing is just mean!  Well that’s good. Because you didn’t! And I’m incredibly happy for ya!!  Oh, we could do this all day.  You are gonna be a huge star! I’m gonna hug ya!  All right!  I think so. Yeah, get off me.  Now wait a minute, I claimed you in the name of France four years ago.  Hey.  Listen, I\\'m, I\\'m sorry I didn\\'t make it over there today.  Yeah well, I hear the place looks great.  Oh hey, it\\'s, it\\'s terriffic. I mean it\\'s a regular space... fest.  Yeah I just... wanted to call and say hey.  That\\'s right my friend. It\\'s time for...  I still can\\'t believe they promoted her to lieutenant.  Well, how could anyone not be in love with Yasmine Blepe?  See, this is the brilliance of the show. I say always keep them running. All the time, running. Run. Run Yasmine, run like the wind.  But we had one of the greatest talks we ever had last night. I mean it was, it was like when we first started living together.  But...  So uhh, how\\'s the palace?  Oh, uhh, actually I uh, have some news.  Well, uh, why don\\'t you ask him yourself. Joey, this is my new roommate Eddie.  Well you know, we got to talking and uh, he said he needed a place and I had a spare room.  Well yeah, in that it\\'s not being used and I... have it to spare.  Hey Jo. When\\'d you start usin\\' mousse in your hair?  Morning.  Oh it\\'s uh, over there on the table.  No, Eddie likes to keep it over there.  Oh, ooh.  What?  Well I do, but uh, Eddie makes them this way and, well they\\'re pretty darn good.  Oh, I couldn\\'t be happier.  There\\'s another carton right over there.  Alright, so what\\'s it about?  Well I like both eggs equally.  Well what\\'s the difference? Your eggs aren\\'t here anymore, are they? You took your eggs and you left. You really expect me to never find new eggs?  Hey Eddie, you uh, wanna play some foosball?  You don\\'t like that show?  Well that\\'s the brilliance of it. The pretty people... and the running.  Oh o-, OK man.  Hey.  Y’know uh, I didn’t actually do this.  No, it wasn’t you.  I got a maid. Yay!  Uh honey, I know you don’t like to relinquish control…  Look, she’s really nice. Okay? And she mentioned that she adored the way that you arranged the sponges.  Yes, I distinctly remember ‘cause I thought it was a joke. Now just give her a chance, okay?  What’s the matter?  See? I told you.  So she stole your pants and then she came back and wore them in front of you?  She must’ve been planning this for years!  Honey, isn’t it possible that the company that sold the jeans made more than just the one pair?  So, shouldn’t we go give her the benefit of the doubt before we go…snooping around her crotch?  Out of curiosity, what is your secret ingredient?  How come?  To see her pants?  Are you sure? Did you see the stain?  God! She is not stealing from us! Okay, will you let this go?  Oh dear God!  And yet you don’t recognize that you’re crazy.  Here’s another plan…No!  Why?  I fear a jury will see it the same way!  You see that?  All right. Yes. Okay. I get your point. But if it’s not your bra will you just let the woman clean the apartment?!  You need new clothes.  I’m leaning. This is where I lean.  Brenda a bee!  Yes! It’s flown into your blouse and you’d better undo your buttons lest it sting you!  You do?  Thanks!  Joey, we would\\'ve asked you, we just thought you wouldn\\'t be interested.  So excited about your letter!  So you must be going to somewhere fancy to celebrate?  That\\'s where people make number two!!  On every word?  And that became ‘they are humid prepossessing Homo Sapiens with full sized aortic pumps...?  I doubt that! Tell her about us last year.  Word!  Oh, I don\\'t think it was desperate, I think it was amazing!  Sounds good to me... but what would a guy think?  Hey Joe! How\\'s the second draft of the letter coming?  Can we read it? Can you print out another copy?  They thought it was very smart of us to have a child write the recommendation letter.  She guessed 8, 9, based on his drawings.  That sounds like fun.  Like war. Or that thing in Joey\\'s refrigerator. Remember? It was in a milk carton but it looked like meat?  Hey! Monica can be cool and fun at organized indoor projects!  Hey!  Monica and I are celebrating our ten-month anniversary, we\\'ve got reservations at Ja George.  Made a few calls, pulled some strings, and they agreed to seat us at 11:30 if we both had the chicken and didn\\'t get desert.  Hey Caitlin! Somebody got a haircut.  Yeah, if that was true, gym class would\\'ve been a lot more interesting.  Oh, he\\'s in the back. The duck pissed him off, said that eggs came first.  Okay, bye!  What?  I was not flirting.  Okay first of all, the impression, uncanny. And second, that was not flirting, that was just casual conversation between two people. That is all.  I was not flirting.  I was not and oh God, shh!  Is that what this is about? You like Caitlin?  So, Joey on Law & Order, you must be very proud!  The one that doesn\\'t.  Hey, why don\\'t you wear those earrings I gave you?  Okay.  If you said, \"Big lima bean, bubbling up.\" Would she understand the difference?  You\\'re welcome.  What?  Really?!  Okay, but there is a big difference. You are a lot hotter than I am.  Yes, it does bother me! And I think it would bother a lot of people. Rachel, when you were going out with Ross, did it bother you when he flirted with other women?  Doesn\\'t know, \"Hello.\" But she knows Capricorn One.  So uh Monica, do you, do you like the Law & Order?  See, I\\'m finding out all this stuff about you today, like you like the Law & Order and that you flirted with every guy in the Tri-State area!  Oh, I\\'m so glad we cleared that up. Look, I\\'m sorry, some things are different for men and for women.  Okay, I\\'ve already taught you so much already, but whatever. See when you flirt with a guy you think, \"I\\'m just flirting, no big deal.\" But the guy is thinking, \"Finally! Somebody who wants to sleep with me!\"  It\\'s true.  Again true.  All guys that are awake. Then we go to sleep and then all the guys from the other end of the world wake up and behave the exact same way.  Oh the humanity.  More so than anything else.  Almost over man.  Why am I looking?  You couldn\\'t have at least changed your shirt.  You ready?  You look amazing. I\\'m the luckiest man in the world.  Let me see the earrings.  I can\\'t believe you would actually say that. I would much rather be Mr.Peanut than Mr.Salty.  I feel violated. And not in a good way.  I am telling you, years from now, schoolchildren will study it as one of the greatest first dates of all time. It was unbelievable! We could totally be ourselves, we didn\\'t have to play any games...  No, interestingly enough her leaf blower picked up.  Oh, no-no-no-no. Last time I left a spontaneous message I ended up using the phrase \"Yes indeedy-o.\"  Hey Rach!  Yes!  I have my reasons.  Hey, I\\'ve been honing!  Oh, uh.. I want her to think I might be in a restaurant.. y\\'know? I might have some kind of life, like I haven\\'t been sitting around here honing for the past few hours.  What are you looking at me for? I didn\\'t know that.  Can I use your phone?  Yes, it\\'s working! Why isn\\'t she calling me back?  Y\\'don\\'t think that makes me seem a little...  Ah, you obviously saw my personal ad.  She answered.  I\\'m not gonna talk to her, she obviously got my message and is choosing not to call me. Now I\\'m needy and snubbed. God, I miss just being needy.  If it helps, I could slide over.  Hello? Hello?  So how\\'s Mindy?  Hell is filled with people like you.  ...And boogie!  Okay, I\\'m gonna go to the bathroom. Will you watch my phone?  Hey, we haven\\'t been on a second date, she needs to hear me pee?  I can\\'t call her, I left a message! I have some pride.  \\'S\\'why I\\'m dancing...  Ring dammit, ring!  What?!  Nngghhh!!!!!!!  Danielle! Hi! Uh- everybody, this is Danielle, Danielle, everybody.  What are you doing here?  ...I\\'m, I\\'m okay.  That sounds good. I\\'ll call you- or you call me, whatever...  Okay.  ...I dunno.  Well, she seems very nice and everything, but that whole thing about her coming all the way down here, just to see if I was okay? I mean,... how needy is that?  Hey! Babe! Aren’t you excited we’re going on our honeymoon?  I’d better go pack.  Oh no-no Joey, I am not going to tell you because I am an excellent secret keeper.  You already know.  Oh honey, leave them alone, they’re in love.  We are on our honeymoon.  25J and K, any chance those aren’t together?  No.  Just act like you belong.  Oh that’s all right, I have it memorized. It’s 1A.  Oh you’ve got to be kidding me.  We’re you just ten seconds later!  What else is new?  Oh no-no-no-no-no-no, vomit tux! No-no, vomit tux!  Well y\\'know a lot of those Muppets don\\'t have thumbs.  Uhh, yeah. She uh, she uh, she uh might\\'ve mentioned him.  Yeah, I don\\'t think he\\'s up to meeting everyone yet.  Yes!  If you\\'re cooking on the stove, does that mean that your new secret boyfriend is better in bed than Richard?  Yes!  Well, you can\\'t just not see Rachel anymore, she\\'s one of your best friends.  That\\'s true!  That\\'s true!  Hey, there he is! There he is!  How many times have I told you guys, you never watch the cooking channel!  Hey!  Oh that was yours? Uh, yeah, we used it when the duck was throwing up caterpillars.  Well I just, thought maybe you\\'d wanna book some time with the best you\\'d ever had.  Why?  What\\'s your point?  I mean I was nothing before you. Call the other girls and ask. Which wouldn\\'t take long. But when I\\'m with you, and we\\'re together, OH…MY…GOD.  Oh-aw my God! Now, I understand if you never want to sleep with me again, but that would be wrong. We\\'re too good! We owe it, to sex!  Yeah, why don\\'t we lose the gloves.  All right, let\\'s show them how it\\'s done.  Y\\'know that wasn\\'t part of it?  Nope.  No, no, no, I don’t, I don’t really wanna play.  That’s not true! I wanted to wear my bathrobe and eat peanut clusters all day. I wanted to start drinking in the morning. Don’t say that I don’t have goals!  Yeah, all right, I’ll play.  No, no, no, you say that proudly.  And was the curse lifted?  But wait a minute though, how are we gonna get there, though, because my Mom won’t let me cross the street.  And then Tineals.  Wow! Just like in the pros.  Sorry. I’m sorry. Y\\'know what, we’re just gonna throw it.  No, no, no, actually losers rhyme.  Great! Now, the score is 7 to almost 7.  No, no, no, no, no!  Mar-haaaan.  Well, that went well.  Y\\'know, I was thinking about ah, asking her for her number.  Whoa-ho, whoa! No, I was thinking about y\\'know for me, as a part of that whole getting over Janice thing you were talking about.  Thanks. What, let me have her?! What do mean? Like if you didn’t I wouldn’t have a shot?  Math!! You’re giving me math! All right, look y\\'know what, forget about it, you go for the girl, we’ll see who gets her.  Well now you have two. Hey, I am good at math.  Hey! Well, I’ve been preparing for that my entire life! Or something about you that’s mean!  Before!!  Is everybody else seeing a troll doll nailed to a two by four?  Okay, good.  No-no-no-no, the game’s not over, we’re just switching teams.  No ah, hold on a second Joe, where do Dutch people come from?  And the other ah, Dutch people, they come on from somewhere near the Netherlands, right?  Fine with me.  Yes!!  Well, you don’t you have Captain Hook explain it to her.  Wh-what?  Y\\'know what, it doesn’t matter, ‘cause she picked me. Me! From now on I get the dates and you have to stay home on Saturday nights watching Ready, Set, Cook!  We’re not gonna lose to girls.  Okay, okay, so we get to take that stupid troll thing home!  Hey-hey-hey Rachel, funny thing. Actually, the ah, end zone starts at that pole, so you’re five feet short, so we win!  Yes. Yes, there is, they play on Sundays and Monday nights.  You’re not gonna die an old maid, maybe an old spinster cook.  Hey now besides, if worst comes to worst, I’ll be your boyfriend.  Why is that so funny?  Ha-ha-ha. A little to hard. What am I not ah, boyfriend material?  Hey!  What a minute, I know that hat! I was taken aboard that hat! They did experiments on me! I can’t have children!!  Buy it for ya, or win it for ya?  Big bullies!!  Hey!  Bored and bored!  Yes!  Okay, umm, we all have to play strip poker.  So, you still don’t think I’m boyfriend material?  I saw you checking me out during the game last night.  Yeah, well, lucky for you.  I don’t know.  Oh, yeah, I don’t know what they were doing, but at one point sea turtles actually came up to the house.  Where ya going?  Okay, then you gotta back away, all right? You don’t need that kind’ve hurt. Take it from a guy who’s never had a long term relationship......  Oh, ahh, no thanks, I just had an M&M.  There is not one hair on that head.  Okay! Okay! Let me try it again, you’re gonna wanna date this next guy, I swear!  That is funny. It was also funny when I made it up.  I made that joke up.  Yes, I did. I told it to Dan at work, and he said it was the funniest joke he’d ever heard.  Monica, you remember me telling you that joke, right?  Seriously?  Yeah, I guess.  It’s my joke.  Dude, you have got to turn on Behind the Music. The band Heart is having a really tough time, and I think they may break up.  Nah, Monica’s watching some cooking show. Come on, I don’t want to miss when they were skinny.  Joey, why is your cable out?  If you need money, will you please-please just let me loan you some money?  Whoa ho.  Yeah.  So, you heard it, you repeated it, so that must mean you wrote it.  And monkeys can’t write out prescriptions.  So, you stole my joke, and you stole my money.  Well, she is going to know that you stole the joke.  Yeah!  You know who else picked Rachel? Ross, and you know what else Ross did? He stole my joke. You know what? I’m going to get a joke journal. Y’know? And document the date and time of every single one of my jokes.  Yeah!  Picking Rachel.  Maybe it’s the sound of Ross climbing into my brain and stealing my thoughts.  So is your apron. You’re wearing it like a cape.  It’s my joke.  Let’s have Monica decide.  Yeah!  Mon, get out here!  Okay, okay. You have to help us decide whose joke this is.  Because you’re the only one that can be fair.  Okay, I thought of the joke two months ago at lunch with Steve.  Can I finish my story?!  I’m not arguing with that.  Is not.  Hi, oh hi.  I’m sorry. You’re not easy-going, but you’re passionate, and that’s good. And when you get upset about the little things, I think that I’m pretty good about making you feel better about that. And that’s good too. So, they can say that you’re high maintenance, but it’s okay, because I like … maintaining you.  Hey, buddy boy, how’d the audition go?  Hey.  I have no idea.  Yeah! I’m just pretending to watch the game so I don’t have to help out with stuff.  Nope! Every once and a while I just scream stuff at the TV.  Oh hey. I’d shake your hand but uh; I’m really into the game. Plus, I think it’d be better for my ego if we didn’t stand right next to each other.  I’m watching the game, but I’m not deaf!  Oh come on!  Good game!  Yeah. Solid effort. Solid effort.  Everybody at my school heard it! You were the hermaphrodite cheerleader from Long Island?!  I’m sorry. When you were in high school you made out with a 50-year-old woman?  Did she look 16?  Well, she probably wasn’t familiar with the process having spent most of her life sitting for oil paintings!  Yes, I believe we can expect a call from the President any moment now.  You’re an actor!  The Velveteen Rabbit was brown and white!  No bunny at all!! Always no bunny at all!!!  How is that me?  When have I ever done that?!  Wow! I don’t have the worst costume anymore!  Oh! Hi!  Joey’s gonna be thrilled! He was hoping you’d come by as a slutty nurse.  You’d think that would embarrass me, but you see I’m maxed out.  Howdy doody.  Oh relax man, relax. You’re looking a little flushed.  What question?  There’s no question.  I cannot believe you didn’t pick me.  And dignity.  Nope! I can do this all day.  God, I’m exhausted.  No way! If anything you’ve gotta let me win! My wife thinks I’m a wimp!  You’re Spudnik.  Listen, I’ve got a secret for ya. I let him win.  No, I let him win—Ross!  Would you tell her I let you win please?  Oh what’s the matter? Are you scared?  Hey man, what\\'s up?  Yeah, yeah! Me too!  Yeah.  Well, I like danger.  Tonight? You-you didn\\'t say it was going to be at nighttime.  It is starting to get dark out there.  Your tax dollars?  I can\\'t smell your sandwich?  Okay.  Yeah.  Sur-surprise him? We\\'re not, we\\'re not gonna make anybody mad are we?  How do you figure that?  Y\\'know, when you say partner it doesn\\'t sound cop. It, it sounds gay.  Look at Officer Ross riding back here with the visitors.  Okay, y\\'know, we-we\\'re safe right? I mean nothing bad can go down!  What\\'s going on?  Uh, HELLO!!  Who jumps at loud noises!  Oh, I just went for a walk, around the living room. Whatever…  No. No I\\'m just tired. Y\\'know, from-from the walk.  You dove in front of Ross! Ross!  I do not hate Ross!  What picture?  Look I\\'m very glad that you saved Ross from the car backfire, but y\\'know, it could\\'ve been a bullet and you y\\'know, you didn\\'t try to save me!  When it comes down to it, you would risk your life for Ross before you would for me. That\\'s the bottom line.  From a bullet!  Much sense?!  So you risked your life, for a sandwich!  So you didn\\'t uh, choose Ross before me.  Really?!  I thought you were showing me how much you mean to me.  Before or after you were shot by your own troops?  Yes, if the foxhole was lined with sandwiches.  Yeah. Hey, here\\'s an idea, why don\\'t we use our wedding china today?  Honey, she keeps canceling on us, take the hint.  What is the point of having them if we never use them?  I will explain it to her.  Muskogee! That\\'s like four hours from Tulsa. Woo hoo!  Aren\\'t you one of the stars of the popular daytime soap Days of Our Lives?  What are you going to do?  Well you proved them wrong.  I\\'ll tell you what, for the rest of our lives, I\\'ll be careful until told otherwise. <looks at china> hey wait a minute this isn\\'t the china we picked out..  Why?  Oh suddenly, flowers are feminine?  I can\\'t believe you\\'d want us to raise Emma.  You know, guys I got to say. This means so much to me. That you would trust me with your child. I mean, we all know that Monica and I have been trying to have a baby of our own. You know I\\'ve had my doubts about my skills as a father, but that you two.. that you two.... <starts to cry>  No, if crazy plate lad.. <sees Monica frustrated at this comment> If Monica dies then I would get Emma, Right?  Actually what?  What?  So if Monica\\'s not around, then I\\'m not good enough to raise Emma?  Well what is wrong with me? Am I .. am I incomptent? Because I managed to survive whatever it is that killed the three of you!  Look, I may not know a lot about babies, but do you really think I\\'m not capable?  Ok. So if we both had Emma and I die <knocks on table>  she\\'d have to give her up.  So.. let me get this straight. So my two friends die, I get Emma. Then my wife dies, then Emma the one tiny ray of hope left in my life gets taken away from me?  Oh? Did somebody miss me? Is there a child to raise poorly?  Yeah but they\\'re right. I mean, I\\'m not a strong father figure and I never will be.  Yeah, but its not who I am. Everything they said was exaclty why I was worried about having a kid. And its true. And look everybody knows it.  Oh yeah, well can you picture me saying \"Go to your room! You\\'re grounded\"?  You said that to me last week.  Oh no thats okay, you\\'re totally right. I don\\'t know anything about disciplining a child. But it did hurt my feelings and I want you to know that when I die, you don\\'t get Joey.  Alright! That is it. This is our apartment and you can not behave this way. Now if you can\\'t act your age then you shouldn\\'t be here at all. Now those plates may not be as nice as the pretty pink ones I picked out, but they\\'re very important to Monica. I want you to apologize to her right now.  Okay. Thats better. Now I want you to both apologize to each other and mean it.  By the way, that fight was totally arousing.  Oh yeah? Well thanks.  Okay, but you should know he eats five times a day and shoves pennies up his nose.  Oh no no no.. I\\'ll get her. I\\'m super-compentent and totally responsibile and fourth in line to raise Emma. I\\'ll be right there Emma. Just let me get my trusty diaper bag here. <knocks over the box of china> Well.. what do you know? I guess, I\\'ll be the one who dies first.  Nope...  Yep...  Any contact?  Come on, Ross, you gotta get back in the game here, ok? The Rachel thing\\'s not happening, your ex-wife is a lesbian—I don\\'t think we need a third...  I think it\\'s winning.  She\\'ll love it. Go with the egg, my friend.  No, it\\'s suicide. The man\\'s got an egg.  Oh, uh, listen, about tonight...  Yes, I know, but her friend sounds like such a...  ...And what did you bring?  Janice?  Ok, I\\'m makin\\' a break for it, I\\'m goin\\' out the window.  Calm down? Calm down? You set me up with the woman that I\\'ve dumped twice in the last five months!  That\\'s OK.  Tell me it\\'s \"you and me\" we.  Ok, you can not do this to me.  I hope she throws up on you.  So...  Oh, what a crappy night!  Joey\\'s not a friend. He\\'s...a stupid man who left us his credit card. Another drink? Some dessert? A big screen TV?  No... no! And yet it did. Good-bye, Janice.  Ok, well, this was very special.  Janice is gonna go away now.  Oh, good, Joey\\'s home now.  How can I dump this woman on Valentine\\'s day?  Oh, man. In my next life, I\\'m coming back as a toilet brush.  Hi, Just Janice.  Ok, Janice. Janice. Hey, Janice. Look, there\\'s no way for me to tell you this. At least there\\'s no new way for me to tell you this. I just don\\'t things are gonna work out.  Oh no, you see, actually it is.  Oh, no I don\\'t.  I did, but...  Call me!  Whoa, she\\'s pretty.  Oh, ok.  Nice!  For a minute there I thought you were actually tryin\\' to smell something.  That\\'s great. All right, I gotta get to work, I got a big dinosaur bone to inspect.  Oh, yeah.  That\\'s a little more relaxed than you want them to get.  Well, of course, lambs are scarier. Otherwise the movie would\\'ve been called Silence of the Ducks.  Yes, and this with the cigarette butt in it, is that decaf?  Believe me, sometimes that happens.  You know, it\\'s funny when my parents got divorced, they sent me to this shrink, and she told me that all kids have a tendency to blame themselves. But in your case it\\'s actually kinda true.  Damn. My mail order grandfather hasn\\'t come yet.  Monica, I feel like you should have German subtitles.  Hey! How come I\\'m stuck dicing, when he gets to ball the melon.  Well now you understand how I feel every single day, ok? The world is my lesbian wedding.  Oh, yeah?  Isn\\'t Ben in this?  Toootal chick-flick.  They\\'re still just friends, right?  I can\\'t believe we are even having this discussion.  I mean, don\\'t you think if things were gonna happen with Rachel, they would\\'ve happened already?  I can\\'t remember the last time I got a girl to take care of my monkey.  Hey, y\\'know what you should do? You should take her back to the 1890\\'s, when that phrase was last used.  Rachel lost Marcel.  Okay, it\\'s his first time out, so he\\'s probably gonna wanna do some of the touristy things. I\\'ll go to Cats, you go to the Russian Tea Room.  Marcel?  Marcel?  Um, we\\'re kind of having an emergency and we-we were looking for something...  Yes have you seen any?  Oh, nononowaitwaitwaitnono! Uh... we may not know anything about radiators per se, but we do have a certain amount of expertise in the heating and cooling... mileu.  Yes, but these women are very hot, and they need our help! And they\\'re very hot.  Okay, from now on, you don\\'t get to talk to other people.  Marcel?!  Eh. I thought that was an alp.  Yeah, well I went to boarding school with four hundred boys. Any sex I had would\\'ve involved a major lifestyle choice.  Wow! That ripped! That ripped real nice!  You don’t turn and slide, you throw it out! I’m tired of having to get a tetanus shot every time I get dressed!  All right, how about we, how ‘bout we sell it.  Uh-huh, first you tell us where you got the prettiest lace in all the land.  You want it?  Ahh, Gepeto, $5,000 dollars? Are you insane?  All right look, I’m changing it to 50 bucks, or your best offer.  I can’t believe you don’t know what I do for a living!  Yes, Joey has a very careful screening process. Apparently, not everyone is qualified to own wood and nails.  You’ll have to pardon my roommate, he wanted to marry this.  Y\\'know, I, I really don’t think we need a canoe.  All right, just, just take the entertainment center, and then when you get home, throw the canoe away!  Y\\'know what, I think this might be one of the times he’s wrong.  Oh-no, he’s right.  I’m coming already!!  OH MY GOD!!!  Are you all right?!  What the hell happened?!! How were you locked in?!! And where the hell is all of our stuff?!!  So—You got in voluntarily?!  BEND OVER?!!!  Oh, umm, Joey was born, and then 28 years later, I was robbed!!  Oh, they said uh, “You don’t have insurance here, so stop calling us.”  I like her.  Well, that’s pretty much all I’m looking for from these people.  No. This is just part of a dare devil game that I play called ‘wait until the last moment before I burst and die.’  Ginger. I’m talking to Ginger, so....  Well, that’s the best kiss I’ve had with anyone I’ve ever met in a men’s room.  Yeah, we’re gonna have to get you out of those shoes.  No, really you’re gonna freeze.  You’re not, what do you, what do you got a bionic foot?  Hey.  Oh, I hate that. I once had a thing of half and half, stole my car.  Great. It was great. She’s ah, she’s great, great looking, great personality, she’s greatness.  Joey told you about the leg, huh?  Oh God, it freaked me out. Okay, I know it shouldn’t have, but it did. I mean I like her, I don’t want to stop seeing her, but every so often it’s like ‘Hey, y\\'know what, where’s your leg?’ I mean I’m the smallest person in the world aren’t I? I’m the smallest person in the world.  It came up.  No. No. Actually I forgot, what is the deal with that again?  No. No. I don’t think so.  That’s-that’s my nubbin.  It’s kinda a ah, a third nipple kinda thing.  You ah, you have, you have to leave, now? How come?  The doctor.  Oh yes! Just had me a little nubbin-ectomy. Yep! Two nipples, no waiting.  That was an obvious joke, and I didn’t think of it. Why didn’t I think of it? The source of all my powers. Oh dear God, what have I done!  Oh, Richard. That\\'s all I ever hear, Richard, Richard, Richard!  Okay, so Richard, Richard!  What?  You okay there man?  Wow umm, calm down.  Uh, no Pheebs. What\\'s it look like?  You got the lead in a movie? That\\'s amazing! What\\'s the movie about?!  Yeah, I know that means buddy!  Well, uh, we can talk about that too Pheebs.  Whoa-whoa-whoa, what are we going to do about my job?  Thank you.  What?  Hey, so where are we staying? Is the movie putting us up in a big hotel suite?  I see, but once you get your first paycheck you\\'ll be springing a big hotel suite, right? I mean, lead in a movie, they must be paying you a lot?  So you don\\'t get paid unless the movie makes money?  All right, bye-bye now!  Okay!  We\\'ve been driving for a half-hour, and you haven\\'t looked at the road once.  Yeah.  Isn\\'t that Ross\\'s money?  I don\\'t know.  Okay!  Too dry.  No!  No!  Yes.  I also said, \"Yes!\"  Look Joe, I just, I just don\\'t want to get your hopes up real high.  They\\'re not even paying ya! This doesn\\'t even sound like a real movie!  Joe, I don\\'t think this is going to be your big break.  Oh, you don\\'t want me on the trip?  All right, I\\'ll tell ya what, the next time you ask me a question like that I\\'ll lie.  All right, fine! Fine! Why don\\'t you pull over? I\\'ll get out right now!  You\\'re not actually supposed to stop on the bridge.  Joey kicked me out of the car on the George Washington bridge!  I don\\'t know! He went crazy! Y\\'know, we were playing that game where you-you ask a question and you answer it really fast.  Well, I don\\'t know what mad him so mad, y\\'know? All I said was that uh, I didn\\'t think this wasn\\'t gonna be his big break, that this movie wasn\\'t going to do anything for him, and that uh, y\\'know it didn\\'t sound like a real movie--Okay, he should\\'ve pushed me off of the bridge.  Y\\'know, he won\\'t even talk to me. How am I going to apologize to him if he won\\'t even talk to me?  Really?  He pulled a quarter out of my ear!  Okay. Wow.  Sure.  That was you?! I thought it was Jack!  What?! Why does she think that?  Again, what?!  As we all are at some point during the day.  Ross had a ring?! And he was gonna propose?  And you did it first?! This is gonna kill him! You know how much he loves to propose!  Well, what did she say?  Does Ross know?  Well maybe you don’t have to tell him anything.  If you clear things up with Rachel then Ross never needs to find out, but you have to do it now before he hears about it and kicks your ass!  Honey, we’ve been over this. I need to be facing the other way.  Hello sir, you know Monica.  Look, we can’t stay in here forever.  I just want you to know that what you witnessed in there, that wasn’t for fun.  That’s funny, this conversation’s how I got the bullet hole in my head.  Seriously sir, my brains? All over the wall.  You still haven’t told Rachel you weren’t really proposing?  Joey, you have to tell her what’s going on! And what did it look like?!  Go and tell Rachel right now before Ross finds out.  Okay, look, just do it gently.  Hey.  Okay, she is the star of the play. And she is my girlfriend! I get to have sex with the star of the play!  I know!!  Wow! She looks great. Doesn’t she?  Is it just me, or can you actually see his abs through his overcoat?!  Yeah, it’s like someone literally wrote down my worst nightmare and then charged me $32 to see it!  I’m totally screwed. Okay, they are gonna be hot and heavy on stage every night, and then they’re gonna go to their cast parties and he’s gonna try to undermine me. Y\\'know it’ll be like, \"So where’s your boyfriend, what’s-his-name, Chester?\" And she’ll go, \"No-no-no, it’s Chandler.\" And he’ll go, \"Whatever. Ha-ha-ha-ha!\"  All right, look, look, what am I gonna do?  Really?  So uh, man, are you gonna go to the play with me tonight?  Yeah, I know but…  Okay, okay, but don’t worry, because we also have cereals, muffins, waffles, and, jams, jellies, and marmalades. Which I’m fairly certain are the same thing.  I’m right! Right? There was like no chemistry between them. Before they had heat, and now there’s no heat! Now you know what this means, Joey told us what this means!  Come on, it was like cousins having sex up there!  Oh, I loved the play. You were great, and Nick ditto. Clearly you’re having sex with him.  Oh come on, it was so obvious! There was no chemistry between you two!  Y’know, I-I could see how this could happen, y\\'know you’re up there every night, you’re naked, touching, kissing.  Well, you can understand, given how we started.  Well, that is what happened, and I don’t even see you denying this!  Yeah, well, don’t expect that to happen anytime soon!  Well, I may be drunk, but I know what she said! Then I went over to Beefsteak Julie’s…  Did she call?  All right, maybe I should call her.  Well, yeah, but y\\'know, what-what if I was wrong?  Well y\\'know, what if she didn’t actually sleep with the guy?  She did not have to tell me, I saw the play, and there was no heat. Back me up here, Ross!  That’s not backing me up! Look, you said with the off-stage and the heat, and the onstage and the oy heat.  Oh my God!!  Hey. I just, I just wanted to come over to-to say that I’m sorry. Y’know? I know I acted like the biggest idiot in the world, and I can completely understand why you were so upset.  Yeah. Well, I think our second fight is going to be a big one!  Well, she wasn’t sleeping with him.  She is now.  I’m saying that she… is a devil woman! Y’know I mean you think you know someone and then they turn around and they sleep with Nick! Nick, with his rock hard pecs, and his giant man-nipples! I hate him, I hate her! Well, I don’t hate her, I love her. This is all my fault really.  Because, I-I should’ve called! Y’know if I had just called her after our big, stupid fight, she never would’ve gone out with Nick, and they would’ve ended up in bed together. I threw her at his man nipples!  Her what?!!  You had a bachelorette party?!  I thought we weren’t gonna have bachelor/bachelorette parties! Y’know, we agreed that it was a silly tradition.  You went home with the waitress.  I can’t believe you didn’t tell me! You know that the two pillars of marriage are openness and honesty!  My God! You must be good in bed!  She’s okay with Rachel and the baby?  Well, you have to honest with her! Otherwise you may think that you’re going down the same path, but you’re really going down different ones.  What?  Honey! That’s crazy! I don’t want you to get me a stripper…  Look, I appreciate it, but uh, it’s a little creepy. Y’know? I’m not a bachelor anymore.  All right fine! But I’m only doing this for you!  And Joey.  Ah, no-no-no just Ross. Ross and Joey is embarrassing enough.  I understand: who would cancel an actual date to go to a fake bachelor party?  What are you doing?  Okay. I can’t believe tomorrow’s the big day.  You’re right, this is more fun.  That’s me.  Yeah, yeah right over there.  That was weird.  So she’s a…  I can’t believe there is a naked hooker in there!  That is funny, maybe for my birthday she’ll murder someone.  Oh actually, I’d rather you…Yeah, go ahead. We’re gonna have to burn that room down anyway.  Why would she do that?  This is the worst bachelor party ever!  Why me?!  Which is why you should do it.  You do it!  I don’t think we’ve actually done this before!  Well we…we still hang out.  Well y’know, things are different. I’m…I’m married now.  Yeah, I miss that too. I tell you what; from now on we’ll make time to hang out with each other.  Her ass print is still on your grandmother’s quilt, do you really want to talk about smoking?  Monica! Wait!  Could you not narrate?  Wait! You’re going out with Kathy!  Look, Joey, Kathy is clearly not fulfilling your emotional needs. But Casey, I mean granted I only saw the back of her head, but I got this sense that she’s-she’s smart, and funny, and gets you.  All right look, I think it’s time for you to settle down. Y\\'know? Make a choice, pick a lane.  All right! Bring it on, you…  Really, bitchin’!  You mean like, music?  Yeah, I know what you’re thinkin’! Yes, yes, your breasts are just as firm and juicy.  Come in!  Uh yes, but uh, I just watch it for the articles.  No-no, he’s not back yet, but he’ll be here any minute. So uh, come on in. Have a seat. Bow or stern?  What happened?  Why can’t you tell her?  Joey! Joey!!  I thought your time ran out.  So I guess it’s just uh, you and me then.  Yeah, I think it is!  Oh, I had an appointment to get my haircut…  …and then it got canceled.  Really?! You do that?  Dog grooming huh? Okay, just don’t make my tail too poofy.  What-what ‘cha doin’?  ‘Kay.  Hey it’s Joey!  What?  Okay.  Yeah. Yes! Yeah.  Oh.  No-no-no-no, this is bad! It’s bad! This is bad!  Wait the uh, the kiss or the situation?  Okay!  Ooh! Yes! Okay! Here’s what we do, we-we forget it happened.  Okay, we-we swallow our feelings. Even if it means we’re unhappy forever. Sound good?  I have to; he’s my best friend, and you’re seeing him.  I-I think we have too.  I sure did.  Well, I just thought it’d make me feel good to do something nice for my friend.  Well, y’know I’m 29. I mean who needs a savings account.  Oh, I don’t know.  You mean with Casey.  Or Casey.  Could be Casey.  Consider Casey.  That all the pieces of my life are falling right into place!  I kissed Kathy.  No. Is there anyway, anyway you think he’ll understand this?  Oh, don’t say that! Don’t say that. That’s not true. Is it?  Then why didn’t you tell me to do that?!!  Why?! Why do I have to tell him?!  Yeah, I know.  Hey!  Is that a real thing?  Listen ah, Joe, I-I need to, I need to talk to you about something.  It’s-it’s about Kathy. Umm, uh, I like her. I like her a lot actually.  Yeah.  What?  Oh uh, when?  Oh man, I am so sorry. Are, are you okay?  Yes, but I-I uh, don’t have too.  Yeah?  Well, I thought that would be the best thing to do.  See uh, that’s-that’s actually what I wanted to talk to you about. I-I think I know who the other guy is.  It’s me. I’m the other guy.  Yeah, I mean when you were late last night, Kathy and I got to talking, and one thing to another and…  No! No! No! I just kissed her.  How is that worse?!  Look, I’m sorry! But there’s nothing I can do, I think I’m in love with her!  You’re right, I have no excuses! I was totally over the line.  Yes. Yes! Right! And I feel horrible. You have to believe me!  Probably because…  This is so sad. I mean, I only have like ten pins.  Y’know I think we should invite them.  Well this is just sad!  Well, thanks a lot for hookin’ me up Rach. I want you to know that I want you to attend our wedding as my guest.  You mean like for award shows?  You mean these tuxes have been down the red carpet with people yelling, \"You are you wearing?! You look fabulous!\"  Not bad.  Who’s that?  Pierce Brosnan?  Are you serious?  007?! This is James Bond’s tux?!  Oh, I have to get married in James Bond’s tux!  A freakish thin date with a hanger for her head?  What?  You can’t wear that! I’m wearing the famous tux! James Bond’s tux!  So—If you wear that you’ll make mine less special.  Please, don’t take away my cool thing. Please?! Pretty please?!  Look, it’s my wedding day okay? If you were getting married I would never do anything to upset you.  That was pretty 007.  Ross is Batman!  Rachel got Ross the tuxedo that Val Kilmer wore in Batman. Okay Batman is so much cooler than James Bond!  Batman has a utility belt!  Batman has the Batmobile!  Actually, I don’t like martinis.  I would but mine doesn’t fit. The pants are a little tight.  Well, does that mean that you’re not going to wearing yours?  An invitation for the At First Sight premiere? Oh my God! Val Kilmer didn’t wear this in Batman! He wore it to the premiere of some tooty-fruity love story where he played a blind guy!  Well, you’re welcome. And tell them we’re really glad they’re coming.  Whose is it?  Whose is it?  Oh, come on! I don’t care! Come on! Whose is it?  Ho! Ho! Ho!  Your pants!  Uhh, a T-shirt that says, \"I don’t belong here.\"  Yeah we do!  Are you serious?  Forget it! Okay, I’m not giving up my bachelor pad for some basketball seats!  No. But uh, Joey has, and I usually talk to them in the morning time.  Forget it! Okay, I’m not giving up the apartment.  Oh my God!  You do know that Wham broke up?  Where is Emily?  Man, didn’t she like just get here?  Easy tiger.  So what are you going to do?  Are you serious?  Because you’ve only known her for six weeks! Okay, I’ve got a carton of milk in my fridge I’ve had a longer relationship with!  Okay, no problem, just remember to wake us up before you go-go.  No thank you.  Look, I want those basketball seats as much as you do! Okay, but we can’t leave in the small apartment after we’ve lived here! Didn’t you ever read Flowers for Algernon?  Look, the only way I will even consider this is if they offer a lot more than just season seats.  Screw the Knicks!  I didn’t mean that. I just meant that the apartment is worth so much more.  And the Knicks rule all.  No. No. We’re not gonna do that, y’know why? Because its not an even trade.  No!  Op, op, I’m convinced!  All right, but you can’t use that again for a whole year. I’m in.  Okay!  Fine, let’s do it.  Okay, you guys uh, you guys pick first  That’s a low one!  Why are you screaming and hugging?  Yeah baby!  No they didn’t!  Those were like the best seats ever.  Oh yeah, that’s very nice. Plus, y’know they were free and they’re too small.  I KNOW!!!  Open up! Open up! Open up!  What the hell is going on?!  We are switching back, right now!  Well, you’re gonna have to leave sometime, because you both have jobs, and as soon as you do, we’re switching it back! There’s nothing you can do to stop us! Right, Joe?  What?  I don’t care, this is our apartment! And they stole—you stole it—our apartment, and we won that apartment fair and square, twice! And I am getting it back right now. I’m getting back right now!  Oh no-no-no, no more offers. You can’t offer anything to us!  Totally worth it!  Good night.  Okay!  Oh, well, that’s great!  We can? All right, I\\'m tryin\\' that.  So, Saturday night, the big night, date night, Saturday night, Sat-ur-day night!  Not a one.  Oh, right, right, shut up.  No, I know, but it\\'s just so hard, you know? I mean, you\\'re sitting there with her, she has no idea what\\'s happening, and then you finally get up the courage to do it, and there\\'s the horrible awkward moment when you\\'ve handed her the note.  Oh, thanks, but I think she\\'d feel like we\\'re gangin\\' up on her.  Ooh, I hate when my father calls me that.  Oh. Well, hold on camper, are you sure you\\'ve thought this thing through?  It\\'s just you and Rachel, just the two of you? This is a date. You\\'re going on a date.  Yuh-huh.  Well, you may wanna rethink the dirty underwear. This is basically the first time she\\'s gonna see your underwear—you want it to be dirty?  Oh, and uh, the fabric softener?  There you go.  Where are they? Where are they?  It\\'s great. Maybe tomorrow we can rent a car and run over some puppies.  Here we go.  Hey, Janice.  Hey, that\\'s not good. Can I get an espresso and a latte over here, please?  What?  Bullwinkle socks. That\\'s so sweet.  That\\'s great.  Well, I\\'m gonna get another espresso. Can I get you another latte?  That\\'s it?  Oh, yeah, that hug looked pretty brutal.  Janice. Hi, Janice. Ok, here we go. I don\\'t think we should go out anymore. Janice.  Oh, my god, I\\'m so sorry. Are you ok?  Oh, I don\\'t know, a million?  I\\'m fine.  I\\'m not fine. Here she comes.  How do you do that?  We should always always break up together.  I\\'m free! I\\'m free!  So, what do you say? Can you get out of work?  Are you really that busy?  I don\\'t have travel insurance.  Hi, Chandler Bing, I have a reservation.  New York.  I\\'m sorry, he\\'s a little bit wound up, we had to stop at every maple candy stand on the way here.  Well, that\\'s impossible, can you check again, please?  Let me get this straight. I called yesterday trying to cancel my reservation and I was told it was not refundable, then we drove six hours all the way up here and now you tell me that we don\\'t have a reservation?  Just give us the cheapest room you have.  That\\'s insane!  Great, at a hundred dollars an apple, we\\'re there!  Dude, you\\'re shaking!  USA Today  And I also got... two more apples.  I also got this great salt and pepper shaker from the restaurant.  Yes, but the batteries...  Thank you, thank you very much!  No!  Oh we did, and you still have all your lamps.  Oh, I didn\\'t factor in the room tax.  What?  Look, we have enough, just walk away.  There\\'s a forest right outside.  Ok, go quick!  Alright, alright, but you better be wearing clothes when I open my eyes.  Sweet mother of all that is good and pure.  Congratulations!  Now we can finally watch Green Acres the way it was meant to be seen.  So uh, which one is mine?  Well they were chair-shaped cows. They never would have survived in the wild.  Uh, two larges, extra cheese on both. But listen, don\\'t ring the buzzer for 19, ring 20, Geller-Green, they\\'ll let you in, OK. If you buzz our door, there\\'s no tip for you. OK, thanks. Pizza\\'s on the way. I told you we wouldn\\'t have to get up.  I\\'ll cancel the sodas.  So how\\'d it go?  Yeah, but uh, it was 1982 and my flock of seagulls haircut was tickling her chin.  It\\'s the Miracle Wax.  Listen can you guys uh, speak up, it\\'s harder for us to hear you when you lower your voice.  Could you get us a couple of beers?  She\\'s one of us now.  Well maybe he was nervous.  Hi!  We\\'re just here to say goodbye, we\\'re off to Ohio.  And so incorrect!  Uhm, thank you, but we\\'re really trying not to get our hopes up.  Yeah. I mean, this girl could decide against adoption or she could like another couple better..  I can develop a condition in which I talk and talk and no one hears a word.  So we\\'re standing firm on the \\'not getting our hopes up\\'?  Yes, but...  Oh, screw it, I\\'m gonna be a daddy!!  Yeah. Just weird, you know. It\\'s like: \"Hi, I\\'m Chandler. May I have the human growing inside you?\"  You\\'re gonna be great.  Thank you so much for agreeing to see us.  Ok.  That\\'s what our friends call us.  So, the fact that I am a doctor, and my wife’s a reverend, that’s important to you?  Plus I thought the baby would be in good hands with a doctor!  Yeah, wow.  No-ot for me it doesn’t.  Yeah, actually. So, you read a file that you liked and you gave the agency the serial number and they contacted us?  You should be. You’re really on top of stuff..  Yeah, I did.  We are NOT signing those papers.  It\\'s wrong. They made a mistake. They think we\\'re somebody else.  You have gotta stop!  She likes Doctor Chandler and Reverend Monica.  Your Veal Chop is $34,95!  But we are not the one she chose! How can you feel okay about this?  I know..  oh, honey..  Monica, I want a baby too, but this woman is giving away her child. She deserves to know who it\\'s going to.  So, we\\'ll tell the truth and who knows, maybe she\\'ll like us for us.  You\\'re Jewish.  Hey.  The agency must have made some mistake. My wife is not a reverend and I\\'m not a doctor.  I could perform an operation on you and prove it if you\\'d like.  Well, our names really are Monica and Chandler. We\\'re from New York.  Erica wait!  You have every reason to be upset. We did lie. But only because we\\'ve been waiting and trying to have a baby for so long. Now we don\\'t know how long it\\'s gonna be before we can get another chance again.  Erica, please. Just consider us. Ask them to see our file. Our last name\\'s Bing. My wife\\'s a chef and I\\'m in advertising.  But you did like us. And you should. My wife\\'s an incredible woman. She\\'s loving and devoted and caring. And don\\'t tell her I said this but the woman\\'s always right... I love my wife more than anything in this world. And I... It kills me that I can\\'t give her a baby... I really want a kid. And when that day finally comes, I\\'ll learn how to be a good dad. But my wife... she\\'s already there. She\\'s a mother... without a baby... Please?  You still want that baby?  This is the New York Times.  We are. He’s meeting us here.  Yeah y-you, how hard is it to say something? Rachel came over to borrow something.  Y\\'know what this is like? This is like when my parents got divorced. Man, I hope Ross doesn’t try to kidnap me after Cub Scouts.  Y\\'know what maybe it’s gonna be okay, I mean it’s been a week.  No.  Yes, yes, it’s just that we ah, we kinda all ready, made plans with Ross.  Yeah, he’s really excited about it too, he even recorded show times on his answering machine.  Well, actually, yesterday I was smoking again. Today, I’m, I’m smoking still.  Look, I’m telling you this is just like my parents divorce, which is when I started smoking in the first place.  Yeahhh. I’m tellin’ ya something, that ah, first smoke after nap time....  Oh that’s great, with my luck, that’s gonna be him.  Hey, shut up!! You’re not my real Mom!!  Can somebody else hug him? I have to stay by the window.  Well, then, I might as well offer to stay.  What?  Beam me up Jesus.  Okay, well, then, I-I have to go to the bathroom.  Oh, come on, there’s a rest stop right up there! Come on, I really have to goooooooooo.  Here we go. Okay, brace yourselves.  Oh, no-no-no-no-no-no!!  Oh I do! Op, no, wait a minute, I took it out of my shirt when I put it on this morning.  Ladies, ladies, let’s just compromise okay? Phoebe, Rachel take off Monica’s bra.  Well, I thought if I littered, that crying Indian might come by and save us.  Okay, now let’s decide who has the nicest ass.  At least let me smoke it to the good part.  Well it’s very unsettling.  Oh no, now it’s not gonna make any sense!  Oh, this is horrible, it’s just horrible.  It’s horrible.  Y\\'know what, I can handle it, handle’s my middle name. Actually it’s the ah, middle part of my first name.  I was being Shelly Winters from The Poseidon Adventure.  Or \\'You\\'re such a nice guy\\' means \\'I\\'m gonna be dating leather-wearing alcoholics and complaining about them to you\\'.  Yeah, it\\'s like when you\\'re a kid, and your parents put your dog to sleep, and they tell you it went off to live on some farm.  \"So how does it feel knowing you\\'re about to die?\"  Hey, that was really good!  Okay. \"So. Whaddya want from me, Damone, huh?\"  \"Smoke away.\"  I think this is probably why Damone smokes in his cell alone.  Relax your hand!  Not so much!  Hey!  Alright, now try taking a puff.  Alright.. okay. No. Give it to me.  It\\'s fine, it\\'s fine. Look, do you wanna get this part, or not? Here.  Don\\'t think of it as a cigarette. Think of it as the thing that\\'s been missing from your hand. When you\\'re holding it, you feel right. You feel complete.  Oh, Satan\\'s minions at work again...  I\\'m smoking. I\\'m smoking, I\\'m smoking.  And this- is my reward!  Okay, so this time I won\\'t quit!  What are you talking about? We love Schhteve! Schhteve was schhexy!.. Sorry.  Yep, we sure showed those Hassidic jewellers a thing or two about softball..  I personally could have a gallon of Alan.  Well, maybe it\\'s a contest, y\\'know? Like, collect all five?  Hey, this is so unfair!  So I have a flaw! Big deal! Like Joey\\'s constant knuckle-cracking isn\\'t annoying? And Ross, with his over-pronouncing every single word? And Monica, with that snort when she laughs? I mean, what the hell is that thing? ...I accept all those flaws, why can\\'t you accept me for this?  Hey, y\\'know, I have had it with you guys and your cancer and your emphysema and your heart disease. The bottom line is, smoking is cool, and you know it.  Ooh, Lambchop. How old is that sock? If I had a sock on my hand for thirty years it\\'d be talking too.  Joey ate my last stick of gum, so I killed him. Do you think that was wrong?  ...That\\'s it. I\\'m getting cigarettes.  Ye-e-es!!  Who’s number two? One of the more difficult games sewer workers play.  Bye!  Yeah, and I don’t have any cologne.  Oh! Worm medicine for the duck.  Okay. I just wanted them to hear it from somebody else.  Almost as good as that play with the two naked girls on the see-saw.  I know.  So that’s the girl you like.  Wait a minute, wait a minute, you don’t like the guy Rachel’s dating? Well, that’s odd.  Could I borrow it?  Oh-ho-ho-ho.  Ross, don’t. Ross!  Ohh, that’s a good one.  Why don’t you use ours across the hall, ‘cause she…has…problems.  Step away from the duck.  And yet, she’s still not hanging up the phone.  Hey!  What?! No! No!  I didn’t know you read tea leaves.  What does yours say Pheebs?  Well, I’m sure you get another one at Ann Taylor’s.  I know it’s tough now, but things will get better.  I’m not great at the advice, can I interest you in a sarcastic comment? Some cheese?  Let’s just say if I can’t find the right CD case I just put it in the nearest one.  In the James Taylor case.  Honey, I’m gonna save you some time, 200 CDs, not one of them in the right case.  Well, if we’re gonna do that we should come up with some kind of order. Y’know alphabetically or by genre?  Oh my God, honey we are so meant to be together. We both have copies of the Annie soundtrack.  What problem did you tell him you had?  You can always sell your baby.  Wow, Ralph Lauren is really going out of there way to show they’re not in the baby buying business.  Oh I’m sorry, you’re kicking me out of my own living room?  God that is good TV.  Phoebs, play with meeee.  Ya know Phoebs, don\\'t feel so bad for \\'em. After they\\'re done playing, I break out the little plastic women and everybody has a pretty good time.  Ah he\\'s a, he\\'s not a big fan of foosball.  No he\\'s, he\\'s alright, just uh, he spends most of his time in his room.  We don\\'t need to remedy that.  That was so lame.  So, you uh, you think that Speed Racer guy gets a lot of tickets er?  What\\'re you kidding? I broke up with her. She actually thought that Sean Penn was the capital of Cambodia.  Well it\\'s not Sean Penn.  Hi.  Oh, uh, he\\'s not here right now, uh, I\\'m Chandler, can I take a message, or, or a fishtank?  Oh, oh, c\\'mon in.  Oh.  Oh yeah, your uh, name came up in a uh, conversation that terrified me to my very soul.  Yes. Hey, can I ask you, is Eddie a little...  Bit country? C\\'mon in here you roomie.  Bye.  So, we gettin\\' a fish?  Eddie, I didn\\'t sleep with your ex-girlfriend.  This is nuts. This is crazy. She came over for like two minutes, dropped off a fish tank, and left, end of story.  Buddy?  There was no fish when she dropped it off.  So, when I woke up this morning, he\\'d stolen all the insoles out of my shoes.  Because he thinks I slept with his ex-girlfriend and killed his fish.  Because sometimes, Phoebe after you sleep with someone, you have to kill the fish.  Oh, I\\'m fine about my problem now, by the way.  We\\'re worried about you.  We came over as soon as we saw.  It\\'s gonna be ok. You know that?  I\\'m sorry man.  Uhhhaahh.  Yeah alright. What\\'re these, raisins?  And we\\'re done with the chicken fried rice.  Or we can do the actual telephone thing.  Hey.  Really?  Phoebe, it\\'s me. You can tell me anything.  What\\'s going on?  Well, my Grandfather was Swedish and my Grandmother was actually a tiny little bunny.  Y\\'know that is a popular opinion today I must say.  The weirdest thing happened at the coffee house, I think, I think Phoebe was hitting on me.  I\\'m telling you I think Phoebe thinks I\\'m foxy.  Ow!  Oh, y\\'know I-I can\\'t hear that enough.  No, I didn\\'t misunderstand, okay? She was all over me! She touched my bicep for crying out loud!  Well it\\'s not flexed right now!  Sure, I\\'ll do it with ya.  That new mountain bike?  Your work makes me sad.  Okay, so now do you believe that she\\'s attracted to me?  Are you serious?  Phoebe knows about us!  Oh man!  Ahh yes, the messers become the messies!  Well you know that thing you said before, I\\'d be lying if I said I wasn\\'t intrigued.  Yeah, listen, Joey isn\\'t gonna be here tonight so why don\\'t you come over and I\\'ll let you uh, feel my bicep. Or maybe more.  Oh yeah, they\\'re totally gonna back down!  Yes.  Okay, listen, how far am I gonna have to go with her?  How do you know?!  At this?!  Phoebe.  Come on in.  Sure.  Me? No. You?  So do I.  I\\'m gonna put on some music.  You look good.  Well, why don\\'t we move this into the bedroom?  Oh, do you not want to?  Listen, this is totally getting out of hand! Okay? She wants me to put lotion on her!  Oh, you\\'re-you\\'re going?  Not if I kiss you first.  Well, I guess there\\'s nothing left for us to do but-but kiss.  Okay! Okay! Okay! You win! You win!! I can\\'t have sex with ya!  Because I\\'m in love with Monica!!  Yes, and we\\'d appreciate it if no one told him yet.  Oh come on man! At least let me finish this last one.  Okay.  No-no, why don’t you hang on to that one.  Okay, that’s like the least fun game ever.  Or what my Father called Thursday night.  Y\\'know, I would’ve bet good money that he’d be the first one of us to get married.  Always illegal Joe.  If that doesn’t keep kids in school, what will?  Y\\'know, I forgot the combination to this about a year ago? I just carry it around. Do you have any Chap Stick?  Y\\'know what, pretty good.  Good! I haven’t smoked yet today, I feel great, and-and-and confident, that is a stunning blouse.  Thanks  What check thing?  Who’s he huggin’?  This guy invented Moss 865! Every office in the world uses that program!  There you go!!  Okay, okay, just because he buys you dinner, does not mean you owe him anything.  Okay, then get the lobster!  Okay. Well, I think the centerpieces are too big  Kinda. They’re really big.  What?  No. No, see when I first meet somebody it’s uh it’s mostly panic, anxiety, and a great deal of sweating.  Sleeping with somebody new, anxiety, panic, and I’m afraid even more sweating.  Well yeah! But now that I know that you’re having these thoughts, I’m back to panic, anxiety, and uh I’m definitely gonna need some kind of sports drink.  Hey Joe! You wanna shoot some hoops?  That’s great.  You’ll be perfect for this! That’s already your name!  Okay, I guess we can lose to junior high girls some other time.  Bamboozled?  Bogota.  What does a Wicked Wango card do?  Higher or lower than what?  Let me see that.  Triscadecaphobia.  Fear of Triscuts?  This game makes no sense!  Oh come on Ross, I think we’re all losers here.  Let me think. Let me think—Oh! I don’t care.  Either, it makes no difference.  I’ll take a card.  This game is kinda fun.  I don’t think the contestants are supposed to speak to each other.  Treasure of the Sierra Madre!  Madre Sierra the of Treasure!  I’d like to go up the ladder of chance to the golden mud hut please.  Six!  Tell it to the Time Turtle!  I’d like a Google Card.  Nooo!!  This is the best game ever!!!  So, where\\'s Mike?  Hey.  Why are you wearing my apron?  Oh, those places! There\\'s always so many people, their being corralled like cattle, and... you know, there\\'s always some idiot who goes \"Mooooo\"!  I\\'m so sorry...  Monica. Calm, self.  Why would you say that?  Yeah, I\\'ve been to these places before, but I\\'ve never really seen them, you know.  Oh, uhm, okay, uhm, do you mind if we ask you some questions about the father?  That\\'s great.  So, what does the other guy do? Does he go to college too?  I\\'ll bet his dad doesn\\'t think so.  Honey, it\\'s us. Of course it\\'s the shovel-killer.  I\\'d keep an eye on him! We have to find out which one the father is.  I dunno, aren\\'t there tests for these things, right?  Pff, easy for you to say, he\\'s a father killer. He probably loves him mommy. He\\'s probably got a tattoo that says \"mom\" on his shovel-wielding arm!  Hey! How was lunch?  Oh God. It\\'s shovely-Joe, isn\\'t it?  How do you know?  Oh God! What was it? The thing that we hardly ever do or the thing we never do?  Actually, it pays nothing. It\\'s an internship.  Well, it\\'s a training program, but at the end, they hire the people they like.  Yeah, I mean, there\\'s probably gonna be some ground work which will probably stink, you know, grown man getting people coffee is a little humiliating  Oh, no, no, I\\'m an intern, just like you guys… except for the tie, the briefcase… and the fact that I can rent a car.  Yeah, well, I\\'m kinda heading into a new career direction and, you know, you gotta start at the bottom.  The comedian? USO?!  I am so much older than these other interns. I can\\'t compete with them.  They\\'re these prototype sneakers and come up with ideas on how to sell them which I can\\'t do because no self-respecting adult would ever where these.  What am I supposed to do with these?  No, I don\\'t think that\\'s the kinda thing they\\'re looking for.  Hey!  Putting on the sneakers… thought I\\'d get into a younger mindset, you know, to see if it sparked anything…  Yes, how\\'s this: They\\'re so uncomfortable it\\'s like getting kicked in the nuts for your feet!  A-huh. So he\\'s rolling down the street and he starts to lose control, you know… maybe he falls… maybe hurts himself. Just then, a kid comes flying by wearing the shoes. He jumps over the old guy and laughs, and the line reads: \"Not suitable for adults!\"  The cold weather hurts my hip!  What did I marry into?  You guys just keep getting cooler and cooler!  Who?  You\\'re right, by saying \"nice\" I\\'m virtually licking her.  Are you asking permission to break the pact?  Awesome, the name really stands out.  Man, we\\'re gonna rock that Asian student union!  Hey!  You know, our band is playing on Friday.  Fresh!  Mint!  I know it. You know, I\\'m totally gonna ask her out.  I said it first, bro.  Totally. I had sex in High school...  All right, I\\'d say we make a pact. Neither of us will go out with Missy Goldberg.  All right, so that\\'s Missy Goldberg, Phoebe Cates and Molly Ringwald, who neither of us can go out with.  Oh, and Sheena Easton. But we probably couldn\\'t get her anyway.  Well, I officially give you permission to break the pact.  Your hands are shaking.  Ross, that was 16 years ago!  Oh really?  Oh really!?  Oh please, and you knew how much I liked her.  Really?  Aren\\'t you...?  Hi Monica.  Not her!  Soo... you girls having fun?  Well maybe if you go to school here next year we can totally hang out.  Well, maybe you can get in on a beauty scholarship.  So where are you applying to?  I\\'m in college and I\\'m in a band.  Yeah, but it was like a million years ago, so it doesn\\'t matter.  Why?  You kissed her that night too?  Seriously, where did this happen?  Oh wait... What bed did you say she was on?  I\\'m pretty sure I put her on my bed.  Why would I kiss a girl, and then put her on your bed?  What did I marry into?  Did you see our bank statement? Can this be right?  I\\'m not sure what they did, but I\\'m inclined to blame Enron.  Maybe I should quit and get a job that pays.  You know what? You know what? I think we\\'re making too big a deal out of this. ok? So we pay our bills a little late this month and maybe next month we cut back on a few things. And maybe we start eating out of Joey\\'s refrigerator for a change. You\\'re chef... what can you make out of backing soda and beer?  No! We\\'re not borrowing money.  Because we don\\'t do that. We are Bings! And if there\\'s one thing my father taught me was... well to always knock before going into the pool house... but the other thing was never borrow money.  That\\'s right! I do! And I\\'m your man. And I\\'m going to get us through this situation even if it means you working twice as hard.  Yeah.... she\\'s not so cute.  Yes dear.  Hey Joe!  Listen er..I need to ask you a favor but you can\\'t tell Monica anything about it.  What? What do you mean you know?  Oh! Right.  Anyway, err... I need to borrow some money.  Oh ok.  I can\\'t believe her! Did she tell you we were having money problems?  What?  What would she get for herself for two thousand dollars that she wouldn\\'t tell me about?  Hey Rach! There she is...My perfectly proportioned wife.  Oh no..don\\'t thank me. Thank you. You know there\\'s not one thing I would change about you? Not one single thing! And definitely not... two... single things.  No no! I just love the way you look, I am warm, for your form.  Well yes yes... You look nice can mean that your face looks nice. I want to compliment your body. I mean..I wouldn\\'t change it. At all. And more specifically, I wouldn\\'t want anything to get any bigger.  I mean, You wouldn\\'t want any part of me to get any bigger would you? Don\\'t answer that.  Yeah?  But honey you don\\'t have to.  Honey I... I love your breasts the way they are!  your ass?!?!?  They...do that?  God why why would you want to do that to yourself!?  Alright look, if it means that much to you, a may be able to get on more with the big boobs. But the giant ass and the big clown feet?  Well! We er..climbed up four flights of stairs, manueveored a narrow hallway, dodged a rabid pitbul... but these last three feet are where it gets really tricky.  Aaaaand....... hernia.  Hi!  Yeah?  Okay.  Okay. I’ve been thinking about it too, and I, I think we’re ready.  But you said you were ready too.  Yes, but haven’t you wanted a kid like forever?  I’m not crazy about babies. I’m crazy about us.  Look, we’ve always talked about having babies someday. I’m not saying it has to be right now, but I’m starting to think that we can handle it. We’re good. We’re really good.  But nothing has to happen until your ready.  What?! It’s not right! We’re not ready to have a kid now!!  I’m kidding. This is going to be fun.  Period math?  Yeah.  Right here?  Wait a minute, it’s perfect. We got a lot of time to kill and we’re in a building that’s full of beds!  Yes, 98.6. You’re gonna be fine.  Should we tell Rachel there’s an empty private room right next door to hers?  Well let me think about that, while I remove my pants!  If it’s not, then there’s two of them. And that would mean it’s the end of the world!  Hi.  Jan-Janice!  Janice I didn’t even know you were pregnant! Who’s the unwitting human who’s essence you’ve stolen?  What?!  That’s funny. Does it-does it hurt? Does the labor hurt?  It’s incredible, I mean one minute she’s inside you and then 47 hours later here she is.  So, do you know what you’re gonna call her yet?  So then I guess Ferdinad is out.  You do?  Oh no, it’s gonna be named after some snack or baked good isn’t it?  That was amazing.  And if not, we got to do it on a bucket.  Oh hey, how\\'d the interview go?  So what happened?  Well you coulda tried, not kissing him.  Come on, Rach.  Uh, yeah.  Why?  Ohh, so?  Monica, you have got to stop this competitive thing! Okay? It\\'s crazy. {Finally! The voice of reason.} I mean, just impress Gary and Phoebe we have to go upstairs and have sex over and over and I\\'m saying no to this, why? Get your coat.  That was amazing!  That was amazing.  No, you\\'re the best.  No, you\\'re the best.  Honey, the tortilla chips know what you mean.  No. And if I did, I don\\'t think we\\'d be going out. Monica, this is getting ridiculous!  Ugh, we have already proved that we are hot! Okay? So why-why are you getting so obsessed about this thing?!  Oh wow! Is that what this all have been about?  Yeah that was great. That was really great! But to tell you the truth, I\\'m more excited about where we are right now.  Yeah?  Y\\'know what I just realized? You just freaked out about our relationship.  Yes you did! Admit it! You freaked out!  Man, I am so beat.  Hey, you just wanna forget about raquetball and hang out here?  Ok, there is one more way to say it, who knows it?  No actually, I was just going for colorful.  What just happened?  That, that is funny. Can I have it back?  No?  Stop talking, stop talking now. Let me just get this straight. You\\'re actually stealing my hat?  No, just wanna make sure we\\'re on the same page.  The mean guys at the coffee house took my hat.  Na, forget it, it\\'s probably stripped and sold for parts by now.  Hey.  Do you have to be a Century 21 real-estate agent to get to wear those really cool jackets?  Alright, I\\'ll tell you what, you call the couch and then, and then we\\'ll call the couch, and we\\'ll see who it comes to.  Don\\'t play with his things.  You had to ask.  I think you played the Gunther card too soon.  Your cappucino sir.  Ya know I think this is much better than the coffee house.  Ok.  No?  Alright, hang on a second there Custer.  Well, couldn\\'t we just lose our virginities again? Ya know, because I think actually mine\\'s growing back.  Ah, there we go.  You burn your mouth?  Bullies, big bullies.  Yes, we\\'re standing out ground...apparently.  Alright, let\\'s do this.  Question. If I don\\'t care about my watch, can I use it as a weapon?  Well, it\\'s sharp, it\\'s metal, I think I can do some, you know, serious damage with it.  Ok.  Ok, so let me just get this straight. So we\\'re uh, strictly talking about the middle?  Yeah, I wouldn\\'t know having missed everything.  Ok so, can I have my hat back?  Hi Monica.  Guys guys, check this out.  Oh, yeah?  We really need to take those tests?  But I don\\'t wanna do it in a cup!  It\\'s weird! In a doctor\\'s office?  Yeah, ok. I\\'m sure that doctor\\'s office can\\'t be worst than on a class trip to the Hershey\\'s factory!  Oh, yeah! RACHEL TALKS TOO!  Deposit my specimen? You know, usually I have to call a 900 number for that kind of talk. Thanks, got it.  Yeah, I guess!  Oh, Come on!  Why are you here?  What!?  Yeah! yeah... The hard part is over!  I haven\\'t... I haven\\'t even thought about the results yet... I just assumed that everything was gonna be ok.  Doctor Connelly just called.  Actually it\\'s both of us.  Apparently my sperm have low motility and you have an inhospitable environment.  I\\'m sorry.  Well, we\\'re gonna... we\\'re gonna figure this out.  Mrs. Tedlock. You\\'re looking lovely today. And may I say, that is a very flattering sleeve length on you.  Hey!  So, it\\'s a typical day at work. I\\'m inputting my numbers, and big Al calls me into his office and tells me he wants to make me processing supervisor.  So.... I quit.  Why? This was supposed to be a temp job!  If I took this promotion, it\\'d be like admitting that this is what I actually do.  It doesn\\'t matter. I just don\\'t want to be one of those guys that\\'s in his office until twelve o\\'clock at night worrying about the WENUS.  Weekly Estimated Net Usage Systems. A processing term.  I don\\'t know. That\\'s the thing. I don\\'t know what I want to do. I just know I\\'m not going to figure it out working there.  Yeah... I just don\\'t have that much cheffing experience. Unless it\\'s an all-toast restaurant.  Thanks, Phoebe. But I just don\\'t really see myself in a big white hat.  Can you see my nipples through this shirt?  Hey, you guys all know what you want to do.  Hey, you guys in the living room all know what you want to do. You know, you have goals. You have dreams. I don\\'t have a dream.  Was it formerly owned by a blonde woman and some bears?  Who are you going out with?  And he\\'s not speaking metaphorically.  Can you believe it? I mean, don\\'t I seem like somebody who should be doing something really cool? You know, I just always pictured myself doing something...something.  Ooh, you know, I had a grape about five hours ago, so I\\'d better split this with you.  It\\'s OK. It\\'s OK. I was always rooting for you two kids to get together.  Again?  Well?  Thank you Helen, that\\'ll be all.  Last time I do that, I promise.  Yeah, but I\\'m, I\\'m so much faster...  No.  Had it.  Hey, look Joey, I\\'m just saying if you need something to hold you over, I can get you a job right here as an entry level processor.  It\\'s not that hard to learn. And as for people realizing you have no idea what you\\'re doing, hey, you\\'re an actor. Act like a processor, people will think you\\'re a processor.  Hey thanks. Scott Alexander, Joey Tribbianni. Joey is a uh, fellow processor.  I was just telling Joey about the opening in Fleischman\\'s group.  Hey, how\\'s the first day goin\\'?  Well there you go.  Jeannie, the head of east coast operations Jeannie?  Weird world. Your kids?  Ya know there isn\\'t a part of that sentence I don\\'t need explained.  Well, invisible kids can be that way sometimes.  Really? Wow. That\\'s some pretty powerful imaginary sperm you must have there.  Well, I\\'m sure you\\'ll teach her a lesson when she steps off the dock onto nothing. Hey Mr. Douglas.  Well the people in my group wanna spend the holiday weekend with their families.  It\\'s about cutting my people a little slack, ya know, for morale. Look, if you wanna see some rough numbers, I can get them to you by Wednesday.  Uh, if you say so sir.  Well, I\\'m going to kill you.  Why?  Why? Wh- wh- why is Mr. Douglas looking for me?  Wha- wh- why, why, why does he suspect that?  Alright, that\\'s it. Look Joey, I\\'m sorry, I realize this is the role of a lifetime for ya, and if I could just fire Joseph, I would, but unfortunately that\\'s not possible so I\\'m gonna have to let both of you go.  I don\\'t, I hate Joseph, ok. I think he\\'s a brown-nosing suck up.  Alright, ok, alright. So I can\\'t fire Joseph but uh, I can sleep with his wife.  Yeah, Karen. I\\'m thinking about having an affair with her. Oh, you know what? I just did.  Oh well it\\'s not me, it\\'s my character, Chandy. Yeah the rogue processor who seduces his co-worker\\'s wives for sport and then laughs about it the next day at the water cooler. In fact, I have her panties right there in my drawer.  No freakshow, she\\'s fictional.  Thank you.  Oh, great. This is just...  Oh my God, it\\'s that Victoria\\'s Secret model. Something... something Goodacre.  Jill says vestibule... I\\'m going with vestibule.  Oh! Some guy. Some guy. \\'Hey Jill, I saw you with some guy last night. Yes, he was some guy.  Alright, alright, alright. It\\'s been fourteen and a half minutes and you still have not said one word. Oh God, do something. Just make contact, smile!  There you go!  You\\'re definitely scaring here.  Hey, it\\'s me.  I\\'m trppd... in an ATM vstbl... wth Jll Gdcr!  I\\'m trppd... in an ATM vstbl... wth JLL GDCR.  Yeah, like that thought never entered my mind.  Um, is it sugarless?  Oh, then no thanks. What the hell was that? Mental note: If Jill Goodacre offers you gum, you take it. If she offers you mangled animal carcass, you take it.  OK.  Yes. Yes, thanks for letting me use your phone... and for saving my life.  Hi, um, I\\'m account number 7143457. And, uh, I don\\'t know if you got any of that, but I would really like a copy of the tape.  Couldn’t I just say, \"This is Ross?\"  Hey!  Yeah, I’d love to but I’ve tried that so many times they won’t even let me in the store anymore.  That’s awesome! That’s great! What made you do it?!  Whoa-whoa-whoa! You broke Joey’s chair?  I thought I broke Joey’s chair! That’s why I replaced it with mine!  Well, what did you think, that-that elves came in and fixed it?  Joey you broke my chair!!  I think I should get the chair!  Well, where’s the logic in that?!  So Joey breaks my chair and I get nothing!  What are you guys? Like a gang or something?!  Hey  Oh, she\\'s at home, putting up decorations for Rachel\\'s birthday party tonight.  I tried, but apparantly singing \"I will survive\" in a helium voice - not helping.  Yes, Bravo on the hot nanny.  Are you kidding? If I wasn\\'t married she\\'d be rejecting me right now.  Now that Rachel\\'s gone?  I wasn\\'t staring. I was leering.  Looks like Joey is doing allright with her.  Seriously dude, 3 years ago.  You don\\'t trust him?  Is this really your long term plan, for me to run interference? Because I could get a job any day now.  Allright, fine, but don\\'t blame me if it doesn\\'t work. Because you know as well as I do that once Joey sets his mind on something, more often than not, he\\'s going to have sex with it.  Picturing that tree?  Where you going, Joe?  Oh. You mind if I join you?  Your thoughts? Plural?  I\\'m afraid I can\\'t let you do that, Joe.  Yes, as a matter of fact he did, so I can\\'t let you go.  Great novels?  Oh, uh, well, I haven\\'t seem it but if I do I\\'ll let you know.  Well, they\\'re Joey\\'s! They gotta be Joey\\'s!  See? They\\'re Joey\\'s! J-J-J-J-J-Joey\\'s!  Yeah!  Well, yeah actually.  I know it sounds really weird, but we\\'re just so bad at relationships.  Help!  Hi, Pheebs!  I didn\\'t know you were taking a class. That is so cool.  Well, what did the police say?  Ross, it\\'s just a sandwich!  Say Ross, when you picture Phoebe living on the street, is she surrounded by the entire cast of Annie?  What is going on here?  Yeah.  Oh—I don\\'t know.  Hey.  Ross?  Which I may say, right now, is out of control.  And you\\'re okay with that?  All right, look! Look. I think I can explain this.  Joey\\'s a sex addict.  Well let\\'s….let\\'s see what everybody thinks of that?  Are you sure Joe? Are you sure you\\'re not just a sex addict?  Yep! From now on its gonna be the four of you guys and me and the misses. The little woman. The wife. The old ball and chain.  The young hot ball and chain.  What’s up?  Listen, if you want to borrow money, its kind of a bad time. I’m buying dinner for 128 people tomorrow night.  But you’re still my friend?  During this time…are you, are you still my best man?  Do I still call you Ross?  So are we…friends again?  Yes, include more people in this.  Wait a minute! I have a date tomorrow night.  Well you don’t have to sound so surprised.  What?  Honestly? Me too.  Yeah. Y’know I keep thinking that something stupid is gonna come up and I’ll go all…Chandler. But nothing has.  Okay. I’ll be right there.  We’re the Bings.  Hi.  Hi…dad.  How did you guys find me? I knew I should’ve hid at the gym!  Panicking! And using the Internet to try to prove that I’m related to Monica. How is she?  No! No! No! I can’t do that!  Because if I go home, we’re gonna become the Bings! I can’t be the Bings!  The Bings have horrible marriages! They yell. They fight. And they use the pool boy as a pawn in their sexual games!  No.  It’s not just their marriage! I mean, look at yours. Look at everybody’s! The only person that can make marriage work is Paul Newman! And I’ve met me; I am not Paul Newman. I don’t race cars! I don’t make popcorn! None of my proceeds go to charity.  I want to. I love her so much, but I’m afr…It’s too huge.  Well yeah, but then…  Depends on what you mean by we.  No.  Yeah okay. Well, what’s the next little bit?  Yeah. You’re right. Hey I-I can do that.  Ross, I am not gonna run away again! I just want to get a little fresh air.  Okay.  Oh fresh air!  What?  I know about Monica.  Yeah, I heard you and Rachel talking.  You don’t know?  Monica’s pregnant.  Well I was! Then I went down to the gift shop because I was out of cigarettes…  But come on, look at how cute and small this is! So I got it to give Monica so she’d know I was okay.  Are you Joey?  Okay.  I do.  Our baby.  Phoebe found your pregnancy test in the trash.  Then…who did?  Hey.  And this from the cry-for-help department. Are you wearing makeup?  That\\'s so funny, \\'cause I was thinking you look more like Joey Tribbiani, man slash woman.  Do you know which one you\\'re gonna be?  Good luck, man. I hope you get it.  Yes, every single one of them.  I thought it was $98.50.  I\\'d just like to say that I\\'m totally behind this experiment. In fact, I\\'d very much like to butter your head.  All right, I\\'m nine years old.  We just finished this magnificent Thanksgiving dinner. I have--and I remember this part vividly--a mouthful of pumpkin pie, and this is the moment my parents choose to tell me they\\'re getting divorced.  Yes. It\\'s very difficult to appreciate a Thanksgiving dinner once you\\'ve seen it in reverse.  Tonight, on a very special Blossom.  Oh, you must stop shooping.  No, I prefer to keep a safe distance from all this merriment.  Ok, we all laughed when you did it with the stuffing, but that\\'s not funny anymore.  The most unbelievable thing has happened. Underdog has just gotten away.  No, no, the actual cartoon character. Of course the balloon. It\\'s all over the news. Right before he reached Macy\\'s, he broke free and was spotted flying over Washington Square Park. I\\'m goin\\' to the roof, who\\'s with me?  Come on. An 80-foot inflatable dog let loose over the city. How often does that happen?  Do either of you have the keys?  Ok, Monica, only dogs can hear you now, so, look, the door\\'s open. Here we go.  Now this feels like Thanksgiving.  Shall I carve?  Ok, who wants light cheese, and who wants dark cheese?  I\\'d like to propose a toast. Little toast here, ding ding. I know this isn\\'t the kind of Thanksgiving that all of you all planned, but for me, this has been really great, you know, I think because it didn\\'t involve divorce or projectile vomiting. Anyway, I was just thinking, I mean, if you\\'d gone to Vail, and if you guys\\'d been with your family, if you didn\\'t have syphilis and stuff, we wouldn\\'t be all together, you know? So I guess what I\\'m trying to say is that I\\'m very thankful that all of your Thanksgivings sucked.  Here, here!  I’m good.  Yuck!  That was like 5 years ago.  Joey…  Yes it was very sad when the guy stopped drawing the deer!  I’m not macho.  No, I guess I just never really cried. Y’know? I’m not a crying kind of guy.  I’d be sad sure, but I wouldn’t cry.  Cry?! I just found a talking puppy, I’m rich!  Oh, that’s Parent’s Day, first grade. That’s me with the janitor Martin.  Oh they didn’t want to come!  No! Look, I don’t cry! It’s not a big deal! Okay?!  You didn’t get more movies that are gonna have us reaching for the tissues all night did you?  Phoebe Buffay in Buffay: The Vampire Layer.  Hey, I had a terrible childhood and I don’t do porn.  Her ankle is what you’re watching?  She’s just doing her job!  There’s no back to this couch!  Yeah I know, but I figured a shot y’know? Maybe one of those stories would make me cry and then you wouldn’t think I was y’know, all dead inside.  Oh that makes me feel so warm in my hollow tin chest.  Yeah?  Okay, well I won’t uh, worry about this anymore then.  Aww, I love you so…  What?!  So you didn’t mean any of that?!  Hey.  Hey.  Well, I\\'m sorry Joe. I didn\\'t think the doctor was gonna buy that it just *fell* out of the socket.  Because the kids need new shoes.  Do I look fat?  Okay, I accept that. When Janice asked me and I said no, she took that to mean that I was calling her a cow.  Okay, well. Janice said \\'Hi, do I look fat today?\\' And I, I looked at her....  Okay, so you both just know this stuff?  That\\'s easy, baggage claim.  Okay, this is good, this is good. All right listen, I have one. Janice likes to cuddle, at night, which, you know I\\'m all for. But, uh, you know when you want to go to sleep, you want some space. So, uh, how do I tell her that without, you know, accidentally calling her fat or something.  Thank you Rachel.  Well, I thought you guys were cuddlily sleepers.  Yeah.  Okay, the old hug and roll.  Okay, one question.  You\\'re pretending the pillow\\'s a girl right?  Umm, not feeling better \\'bout Malcom.  Well, your gonna need much bigger jars.  That, that\\'s what\\'s stupid.  No, that\\'s all right. I just had a jar of mustard.  You mean there\\'s more than one of us.  And that\\'s how you bought it?  Pheebs, wake up and smell the restraining order.  Sure. What\\'s up?  Happy Valentine’s!  I love you, St. Valentine.  Woah, woah, that’s not pretty!  I am trying!  It’s yelling…bleeding…dilating. Oh, the dilating…  I thought…maybe…you got me porn for Valentine’s Day.  Well, I’m not really in a sexy mood right now.  Well, remember the first time we saw Jaws?  How long it took to go back in the water?  You don’t know. You didn’t see it.  90 seconds.  You know, it haunts me? Up ‘til now, the worst thing I ever saw, was my father doing tequila shots off the naked houseboy. After this, I would gladly make that my screensaver!  I can do that.  Okay. Now all we’ve got to do is get rid of this chair.  Oh, I know!  Poor Ross.  Oh, great. We have to watch him do yoga in his underwear, but for this he closes the drapes!  Oh, and we should warn you, before you watch it: don’t watch it.  Well, let’s just say it’s ironic how footage of someone being born can make you want to kill yourself.  Why have I seen this thing three times?!  Wait, you guys, look!  No, the baby’s out! Look, look!  And look how happy the mom is now!  How did the job stuff go?  Or facing a bitch of a commute.  Well, it makes me feel sad, but...  I see.  Is this the best way to use one of your three magic wishes?  We close escrow tomorrow, so seeing another house can only confuse us, and we\\'re easily confused. We\\'re not very bright.  What do you think Pheebs?  Yeah.  You\\'re kidding!  Oh yeah?  I know. *He* always wanted to be the first black man to cross the Atlantic.  Unless Snoopy says it to Charlie Brown, I think we\\'re okay.  It feels like we’re cheating on our house. And if we’re gonna cheat, shouldn’t it be with like a hot, younger house, that does stuff that our house won’t do?  And yet I never run into Beyonce!  This can not be happening!  The only way that that is going to happen, is if the other couple are the Hitlers.  That is a great idea! And by the way, I don\\'t mean to sound distasteful, but when did you start crapping money!?  Alright alright, we still have three hours till escrow closes on our house. We can still get out.  The Hitlers will be so disappointed.  Wait! I just want you to know that... I\\'m so happy you\\'re going to be here.  Because... that way... we can pick up where we left off.  I never stopped loving you.  Yeah, yeah, yeah! I want you... I need you... I must have you Janice Litman Goralnik Neihosenstein.  Now that you live next door, we can be together every day. Sid and Monica never have to know a thing.  Don\\'t say that. Don\\'t tangle the dream and take it away.  I understand.  Hey, that monkey\\'s got a Ross on its ass!  Might wanna open with the snowman.  Nothing for you, you have Paolo. You don\\'t have to face the horrible pressures of this holiday: desperate scramble to find anything with lips just so you can have someone to kiss when the ball drops!! Man, I\\'m talking loud!  It\\'s just that I\\'m sick of being a victim of this Dick Clark holiday. I say this year, no dates, we make a pact. Just the six of us- dinner.  Y\\'know, I was hoping for a little more enthusiasm.  Wait a minute, wait a minute, I see where this is going, you\\'re gonna ask him to New Year\\'s, aren\\'t you. You\\'re gonna break the pact. She\\'s gonna break the pact.  Yeah, \\'cause I already asked Janice.  I snapped, okay? I couldn\\'t handle the pressure and I snapped.  I\\'m not saying it was a good idea, I\\'m saying I snapped!  Too many jokes... must mock Joey!  Aah, y\\'killing me!  Y\\'know, if you\\'re gonna work late, I could look in on him for you.  Okay, but if he asks, I\\'m not going to lie.  Fun Bobby? Your ex-boyfriend Fun Bobby?  I happen to know a Fun Bob.  That\\'s so weird, I had such a blast with him the other night.  Yeah, we played, we watched TV.. that juggling thing is amazing.  With the balled-up socks? I figured you taught him that.  Y\\'know, it wasn\\'t that big a deal. He just balled up socks... and a melon...  You remember Janice.  Kill me. Kill me now.  Alright, Janice, that\\'s it! Janice... Janice... Hey, Janice, when I invited you to this party I didn\\'t necessarily think that it meant that we-  I\\'m sorry you misunderstood...  Ooh. Uh, I don\\'t know how to tell you this, but she\\'s in Monica\\'s bedroom, getting it on with Max, that scientist geek. Ooh, look at that, I did know how to tell you.  And the moment of joy is upon us.  Alright, somebody kiss me. Somebody kiss me, it\\'s midnight! Somebody kiss me!  They couldn’t be worse. I spent eight hours calling him last night, just trying to get him to talk to me.  Hey, by any chance did either of pick uh Rachel for your secret Santa, ‘cause I wanna trade for her.  Wow! Why do you want to get rid of her so badly?  Op, y\\'know what though, it’s kind’ve a girlie briefcase.  Hey, what time is it? The big game is about to start!  Thanks.  Monica got ice in her eye, and it hurts.  Well maybe you should put some ice on it.  He’s really picky about his patients.  Oh y’know what, I was already trying to trade for ah, well, you.  I don’t know R.G., I was thinking something girlie for your office.  Oh no-no-no, you don’t want to do that, then you’re gonna get stuck with Rachel and she exchanges every gift she ever gets.  Like?  When was the last time you saw her wear it?  Big dog?  I walk into a room and he won’t even talk to me, he just mumbles something in Italian. And I know he only knows the bad words.  Hey Joe.  Oh, uh, when-when are you coming back?  What?!  Hey, look, what do you want me to say? Do you want me to say that I’ll stop seeing her?  Hey, look, I know what it is to be a friend, I just-I just screwed up!  All right look, if you’re not gonna stay for me, then at least stay for them! Okay, they have had a very difficult year! What with the robbery and all!  What?  How do ya do.  What happened? What happened?!  Sorry!  Okay, okay, you got it!  You can’t tell, but I’m trying to break the tension by mooning you guys!  You’re right, and I’m sorry! This means a lot to me! I want you to be my friend again! I swear, I won’t say another word tonight.  Absolutely!  So?  Yeah?  Man, this is…  Honey, you remember my boss Doug right?  I didn’t know you and Carol were getting divorced, I’m sorry.  No.  Oh yeah. Boy, urine cuts right through an ice sculpture doesn’t it?  Oh uh, as it turns out, we can’t do it. Monica has to work.  Oh uh well tomorrow’s no good for her either.  It’s the semi-finals…of her…botchy ball tournament.  Well now-now you’re just talking crazy.  Because uh…we-we…we split up. Monica and I split up. Hold me.  Y’know what would really help me through this tough time is choking something. Can I choke ya?  Oh that’s all right sir, and that’s just one girl.  It’s a hand. It’s a thing you use as a Jack and Coke holder.  Oh no-no-no!  Hi honey I’m home.  It was awful. To get out of going to dinner with Doug I told him that you and I split up. So then he took me to all these strip clubs and sleazy bars, and then when I wouldn’t give him my wedding ring, he threw a soda can at a bird!  Y’know what the worse part was? I got to see what my life would be like without you. It was like It’s a Wonderful Life with lap dances. Please promise that you will never leave me, that we will grow old together, and be with each other for the rest of our lives.  Ooh, I don’t know if we’re there yet.  Are you, are you high?  Really? I don’t like baths.  Honey, it’s not the bath I enjoy, it’s the wet, naked lady.  Really? What do you do? You just sit in there stewing in your own filth.  Honey, it’s 2:00 on a Wednesday and I’m watching Road Rules, how stressed do you think I am?  Oh! Uh, yeah! Is this a cold pizza talk or a leftover meatloaf talk?  Oh my God, what’s up?!  Oh no-no, no you don’t, just come back.  Do you?  In London?  Yes. When Monica and I were in London, we were both in London.  If that.  Hey.  Sex on the balcony?  What is it?  Honey, I don’t like baths! Could you draw me a picture of us having sex on the balcony?  Well, this does butch it up a bit.  All right, if I do this, can we at least discuss sex on the balcony?  Oh my God.  I’m going to need a bigger boat.  I’m in the bathroom, can you come in here? I think there’s something wrong.  I’m in the bathtub.  I drew my own bath, but I did it wrong! The water’s tepid. The salt didn’t dissolve and is now… lodged places. And the scents I used don’t compliment each other. Eucalyptus and chamomile—Oh!  Yeah! Sure, sure. So, what was going on with you today? Oh-oh-oh!  I had the exact same conversation.  I don’t know! Joey hasn’t had this much trouble getting out words since we saw him in Macbeth!  All right, let’s break this down. What exactly did he say to you?  Uh-huh.  He didn’t say anything about that to me.  He was asking all these questions about you, me, and London. And, of course the glue that holds this all together, the rules.  But what did he mean by rules?  Because he was looking at her differently.  My God! He wants to do it with Phoebe in London!  You don’t say anything.  I’m not going to let you say anything.  Oh, God!  Do I smell essential oils?  Okay.  L-leaving my troubles behind?  Oh, it’s so hard to care when you’re this relaxed.  You like Rachel?!  I’ll…I’ll get you later!  Yeah. And what you’re doing feels so good.  You’re not?  Oh, sweet Lord. New realms of pleasure!  Hey!  I\\'ve got nowhere to go this morning. I\\'m unemployed! I don\\'t know what I\\'m gonna do with my life.  I mean, what am I supposed to do with myself?  But it\\'s all so overwhelming. I don\\'t know where to start.  Hey! This is where your hyper-organized-pain-in-the-ass stuff pays off!  How long was I in there?  Wait. Advertising! That\\'s a great idea!  I don\\'t think I have to hear the rest. Advertising makes perfect sense. Sorry you had to waste all this time, though.  I mean, I can write slogans. I mean, how hard can it be, right? \"Cheese. It\\'s milk that you chew.\" \"Crackers. Because your cheese needs a buddy.\" \"A grape. Because who can get a water melon in your mouth?\"  Honey? Leave it to the pros.  \"The phone. Bringing you closer to people...who have phones.\"  No, no. But let me show you what I can do. \"Bagels and donuts. Round food for every mood.\"  Really? That\\'s great!  It\\'s funny. When you said \"unpaid\" it sounded like you said \"unpaid.\"  Actually, we\\'re trying, and I don\\'t think Monica\\'s gonna wanna postpone it. We\\'re supposed to have sex tonight. Actually, she\\'s probably at home naked right now. I tend to keep talking until somebody stops me. I can just picture her on the bed right now.  Whatever I decide to do, I\\'m gonna be starting a career from scratch. It\\'s gonna be a while before I make a living at it. Maybe now is not the right time to be starting a family.  Yeah.  Yeah, Ross is here so...  Hey.  Oh, yeah. But you have to give it back if I get a job. Of course, by that time in the future ties will be obsolete and we\\'ll all be wearing silver jump suits.  Oh god, I have to tell you something. You\\'re not pregnant.  That thing that I have to do to make a baby. I faked it.  Oh yes you can. You just make the faces and the noises.  That\\'s actually why. Look, I\\'m starting a whole new career now, and I\\'m not saying that I don\\'t want to have a baby, I\\'m just saying maybe we could wait a little while.  Or a year?  Yeah, me too. Look, I\\'ll just get my old job back.  I quit and you learn what I do?  I guess. It\\'s always gonna be scary when we have a baby.  Should we go make a baby right now before you change your mind?  Oh, and I promise, I will not fake it this time.  Uh, if I were omnipotent for a day, I\\'d.. make myself omnipotent forever.  You got waaaay too much free time.  Happy birthday, pal!  Well, aren\\'t we Mr. \"The glass is half empty.\"  Eleven days before Halloween.. all the good costumes are gone?  You got it.  We\\'ll take a brief time out while Messier stops to look at some women\\'s shoes.  Yes, Bunny?  What? There was ice there that night with Carol? Plastic seats? Four thousand angry Pittsburgh fans?  He\\'s open!  Hey, look, we\\'re on that TV thing!  Yes, the moon, the glow, the magical feeling, you did this part- Could I get some painkillers over here, please?  Well, what? What? What is it? That she left you? That she likes women? That she left you for another woman that likes women?  Then what?  I think it\\'s great. Y\\'know, it\\'s sweet, it\\'s romantic...  Oh, I thought you were great in Silence of the Lambs. Oh come on, admit it! All things considered, you had fun tonight.  You gotta do it, man.  Hello? Oh, uh, Rachel, it\\'s the Visa card people.  What are you guys doing?  Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!!  Yes, Joey\\'s made arrangements to have his baby in a movie from the 50\\'s.  You have to pick your moments.  I used to have that bumper sticker.  Mmmm. Not tonight, honey. I got an early day tomorrow.  Oh, ok, \\'cause we never do that.  You\\'ll get one.  All right. I\\'ll tell you what. When we\\'re 40, if neither one of us are married, what do you say you and I get together and have one?  Oh, no, no. I just meant hypothetically.  No, no, no.  Rachel, what is the deal with you and doctors, anyway? Was, like, your father a doctor?  Where have you been?  Mazel tov!  I know, I still am one of these.  Hey Pheebs, what’s up?  Buy stamps, pick up dry cleaning…Don’t let Phoebe in.  Hey babe.  Who says you can’t get a nice punch bowl for under six bucks? Maybe we can take it back?  How about to the street say from the balcony?  Okay. How about in that cabinet?  Oh y’know, I’ve been living here a while and I’ve never seen what’s inside that closet. What is, what is in there?  Don’t try to make me uncomfortable with feminine stuff!  Fine.  Monica has a secret closet and she won’t let me see what’s in it.  I don’t know! What could she possibly be hiding in here that I can’t see?!  Why would Monica be keeping Richard in here?  And here we go…  There has got to be a way!  Maybe Monica has a bobby pin.  So, how’s the hideously inappropriate crush on Rachel coming?  That’s a good idea.  I married Fred Sanford!  No, honey you’re not sick! Look, I don’t love you because you’re organized, I love you in spite of that.  Yes! And look, now that I know if I got some extra stuff lying around can we, can we share the closet.  Hey.  So Rachel’s all moved out huh? How are you taking it?  Are you okay?  Oh! Right. Umm, maybe that’s because I didn’t send him an invitation.  I don’t even know the man. Okay? We’re not the close. I haven’t seen him in years.  Well he doesn’t have to know! It’s not like we run in the same circles. I hang out with you guys, and he stars in a drag show in Vegas.  Trust me, you don’t want him there either. Okay? Nobody is gonna be staring at the bride when the father of the groom is wearing a back-less dress.  What’s this?  Y’know we already went over this and I won!  Look forget it okay? I don’t want to go. I don’t want to see him. I don’t wanna.  No-no all kids are embarrassed by their parents, you’d have to come up with a whole new word for what I went through. When I was in High School, he used to come to all of my swim meets dressed as a different Hollywood starlet. Y’know it’s hard enough to be fourteen. You’re skinny. You’re wearing speedoes—That your mom promised that you would grow into! And you look up into the stands and there’s your dad cheering you on dressed as Carmen Miranda. We was wearing a headdress with real fruit that he will later hand out to your friends as a healthy snack!  He had sex with Mr. Girabaldi!  Does it matter?!  Yeah o-okay, but I’m just doing this for you.  So I really never get to win anymore?  No! No! I don’t want him to know we’re yet! I’m not sure I’m ready for that. And besides he’s not gonna be too happy to see me either.  I don’t know if I’ve told you this, but he’s kinda tried to get in contact with me a lot over the last few years  And there’s daddy!  Believe me, I’ve been saying that for years. Oh my God!  That’s Mr. Girabaldi playing the piano.  He’s coming into the audience. He’s coming into the audience.  It can’t happen like this. Okay? I’ll meet you back at the hotel.  Oh, they’re a hoot.  Actually Monica and I are engaged.  Wait! Wait! We’d really love it if you could be there.  I know it would make me happy, ma’am.  Yeah. Thanks for making me do this.  I think that’s the youngest girl ever to reject me.  Oh hey!  No. I mean I believe that uh, certain people are more suited for each other and I believe in falling in love, but soul mates, I don’t think they exist.  Why?  What?  A tall guy with hair similar to mine, oh unknowable universe!  Luckily, the guy she settled for can’t hear what you’re talking about.  You believe that this guy is destined for someone else and you’re still gonna date him?  What are you doing?!  I believe in tall, handsome strangers who hit on my wife!  Cheese you say? That’s some pretty smelly work, huh Don?  Cheese, it’s smelly. You must smell a lot of the time too.  Is it made of cheese?  What do we do?  Sure, why don’t you set it up. I’ll just be over here, browsing through the personals.  Yeah, fine. Fine. Not perfect!! But good enough.  I’m sorry, did you say cheese?  Phoebe thinks you and Don are soul mates, and I don’t believe in that kind of stuff. But then you two totally get along. So look, I won’t stand in your way if you want to run off with Don and live in a house of cheese.  You don’t?  So you…you don’t want to live with Don in a cheese house?  I love you.  Okay. Okay.  Hey! What are you guys doing?  I’m sorry, who?  But we don’t know the neighbors.  Wouldn’t it be easier if we just moved?  Eh, somebody’s in a good mood!  Hey, you cry every time somebody talks about Titanic!  Hey! So are you enjoying the bike?  Absolutely! Y’know, because touchie can mean both ass and good worker.  What is the matter with you?  Maybe, isn’t she the woman who lives below you and has sex really loud?  Y’know what would work?  Stop making candy!  You mean they like you.  Is that why you became a chef? So that people would like you?  Joey!  What are you doing?  All right, y’know what? Forget it, all of you forget it! You’ve ruined it! Go home! You’ve ruined it! You’ve ruined it!  No! Smokes-A-Lot Lady blew smoke directly into my mouth. Eh-uh—are you okay?  Hi!  How come?  Do you have any ideas?  Oh, well... Maybe I\\'ll join them some time. I just hope the club doesn\\'t slip out of my hand and beat the moustache off his face.  So how come Richard\\'s selling the place? Went bankrupt? Medical malpractice? Choked on his own moustache?  mmm That\\'s enough about you!  No, no, no, no, no, NO! No, no... we\\'re not together. We\\'re not a couple. We\\'re definately not a couple.  There\\'s a tape here with Monica\\'s name on it.  Don\\'t judge me, I\\'m only human!  I had to! Okay, imagine you were married... and you found a tape of your wife in another guys\\' apartment... Wouldn\\'t you need to know what was on it?  Some girl...!?  Yeah...!?  Then you\\'re gonna have to watch it for me.  Just for a few seconds, so I can know what it is... Please?  Why am I hearing cheering?  Football? Just football?  Whoho ho... Listen to the judgement from the porn star!  Because that\\'s who I am, okay? I\\'m sure a mature man like Richard could see a tape like that and it wouldn\\'t bother him. Just\\'d be another saucy anecdote for him to share at his men\\'s club over brandy and moustaches.  This is about you and Richard. He\\'s clearly not over you. He keeps a tape so he can... look at it whenever he wants.  Oh, yeah, well, poor Richard. Y\\'... I can grow a moustache!  Yeah, oh, but I just keep picturing you rolling around with him with your cowboy boots in the air...  Oh, good, good. Play more, \\'cause I wanna see how it ends.  What...? That\\'s not you! Life is good again! Ride \\'em cowgirl!  Is that a problem?  Yeah, we have all this paperwork that needs to be filed by the end of the year. If I don\\'t get it done, I\\'ll be fired.  So, who does?  I\\'m sorry, I won\\'t be here.  Did I not mention that?  Hey. Where\\'ve you been?  Well, that\\'s like money in your pocket! - Alright look, you want me to say it? This sucks. Being here sucks! This work sucks!  I\\'m sorry. Hey, at least you guys get to go home and be with your families tonight. I have to go back to an empty hotel room and lay down on a very questionable bedspread. And then tomorrow morning, you get to have Christmas morning in your own houses, wich, by the way, none of you have invited me to.  Haha, no thanks!  Oh, thanks! I\\'m... actually thinking about becoming a motivational speaker.  Typical Christmas-y stuff, you know? Our holidays are pretty traditional...  I can save you time ladies, I\\'m right here.  What? That\\'s terrible!  Oh well, that, that makes it not terrible.  No not okay, you can\\'t look for Monica\\'s presents!  No, you don\\'t have to, and you can\\'t because I, I live here too.  Why?  No, I have a great idea for a present for her.  If I help, we can find \\'em faster!  OK, Pheebs, your turn.  And, a lemon lime.  And last but not least.  Well, I\\'m here to see my old buddy Ben. What are you doing here, weird...turtle-man?  What?  You called everyone and said you were having trouble finding a Santa costume, so I borrowed one from a guy at work!  Why?  But I didn\\'t get to shake my belly like a bowl full of jelly.  Fine, I\\'ll give the suit back.  Santa? Really?  Did your Dad ever dress up like Santa?  You know what, everybody? Go home. You should be with your families. It\\'s bad enough that we\\'re working New Year\\'s Eve.  Did I not tell *anyone* about New Year\\'s Eve? -- Alright, look, go! Go home, okay? Merry Christmas! Go.  Ah. Thanks.  Ahh, Merry Christmas; I miss you guys!  Ah, well no, it\\'s just uh, me and Wendy.  It is. Did I... not tell you about her?  I sent them home.  Uhh, uh...  I don\\'t know!  I don\\'t think of her that way, you know, she\\'s a, she\\'s a colleague.  Oh, she\\'s regional Vice President; She\\'s... just below me.  BE-LOW me!  Well, she... she didn\\'t win...  Well, second prettiest that year; I mean, of *all* the girls in Oklahoma, she\\'s probably...  Honey, there\\'s really nothing to worry about.  I\\'m serious!  Merry Christmas.  Merry Christmas, you guys!  Ah well, she\\'s got this weird idea, that, uh, y\\'know, just because you and I are alone, that something is gonna happen.  This is probably the wrong thing to be worrying about, but... you\\'re getting ham on my only tie.  I\\'m *happily* married.  Right. So, I\\'m sorry...  Well look, it\\'s not easy to spend this much time apart, you know. She\\'s entitled to be a little paranoid... or, in this case: right on money! ... You know, she\\'s amazing, and beautiful, and smart, and if she were here right now, ...she\\'d kick your ass. Look, you\\'re a really nice person... ham stealing and adultery aside. But, what I have with my wife is pretty great, so nothing is ever gonna happen between us.  I mean, you were the most beautiful woman in the room tonight!  But we don\\'t do that.  How drunk are you?  What?  I know.  Okay!  It bodes well for me that speed impresses you.  Yep!  Count of three?  Two!  Well I think it\\'s safe to say that our friendship is effectively ruined.  So, are you really gonna go out with that nurse man?  Y\\'know, I don\\'t know if you\\'ve ever looked up the term goofing around in the dictionary... Well, I have, and the technical definition is, two friends who care a lot about each other and have amazing sex and just wanna spend more time together. But if you have this new fangled dictionary that gets you made at me, then we have to, y\\'know, get you my original dictionary. I am *so* bad at this.  Really? Okay, so...  Y\\'know, I sensed that I should stop. So we\\'re okay?  Right!  Oh, okay, I have condom in my wallet that I\\'ve had since I was twelve.  I don\\'t think so.  No, we\\'ll-we\\'ll bring it back! Just put it under your dress.  Ehh.  Look, I thought about it too, and I\\'m sorry. I think we should spend all of the money on the wedding.  Yeah, I\\'m putting my foot down. Yeah look, when I proposed I told you that I would do anything to make you happy, and if having the perfect wedding makes you happy, then, then that\\'s what we\\'re gonna do.  Eh, forget about the future and stuff! So we only have two kids, y\\'know? We\\'ll pick our favorite and that one will get to go to college.  Yeah.  Uh, four, a boy, twin girls and another boy.  Well, stuff like where we\\'d live, y\\'know? Like a small place outside the city, where our kids could learn to ride their bikes and stuff. Y\\'know, we could have a cat that had a bell on its collar and we could hear it every time it ran through the little kitty door. Of course, we\\'d have an apartment over the garage where Joey could grow old.  Sure you do.  You sure?  I love you so much.  Hey!  I wanted to be with you. I missed you so much.  Monica.  I never want to leave you again!  Turns out they can\\'t fire me. Because I quit.  Yeah! It\\'s a stupid job, and I could not stand leaving you. And why should I be the only one who doesn\\'t get to do what he *really* wants to do?  I know, I, I should have talked to you first about it.  Thanks!  I... thought it was a timely start to thinking about other people. Besides, this gift still says I love you guys.  I don\\'t have a *job*!  That’s great!  So you kissed her, so what happened after that?  So she’s just waiting over there for ya?  I’m not your garbage man. I’m your mailman.  You took off your pants and climbed under the sheets!  You made pottery?  Ahh, just like the apothecary tables of yore…  Look at us, we’re a couple of couples!  Oh that’s too bad.  That’s funny, I saw no phlegm.  Then why-why is she going to a play?!  Well, why does she not want to hang out with us?!  So she was just pretending to have a good time last night? She was lying to our faces?!  And I am not blah, I am a hoot!  No, you sh—No you said you made that up!!  Okay.  Okay, one more time.  Perfect decibel.  Hey.  Oh nothing, we’re just talking. Y’know, blah-blah-blah.  That’s totally understandable.  Oh yeah!  Did you hear that?  Hey so, did uh, did she move out?  You okay?  Hey.  I broke up with her.  They were huge. When she sneezed, bats flew out of them.  I\\'m tellin\\' you, she leaned back, I could see her brain.  You or me?  Maureen Rosilla.  Ok, Janice. Janice. You gotta give me Janice. That wasn\\'t about being picky.  Ok, Phoebe.  Uh-Oh. It\\'s Isaac Newton, and he\\'s pissed.  Actually, I think this apartment sullies the good name of crap  Hey, look at this. \"My Big Book of Grievances.\"  April 18th, excessive noise. Italian guy\\'s gay roommate comes home with the dry-cleaning. Well that\\'s excellent.  Wow, he looks so normal.  Funniest? Heckles?  Wow, Heckles was voted class clown, and so was I. He was right. Would you listen to that?  Whoa!  Heckles played clarinet in band, and I played clarinet. And he was in the scale modeler\\'s club, and I was, well, there was no club, but I sure thought they were cool.  I just think it\\'s weird, you know? Heckles and me, Heckles, and me, me and Heckles...Would you knock it off?  Look at this. Pictures of all the women that Heckles went out with. Look what he wrote on them. Vivian, too tall. Madge, big gums. Too loud, too smart, makes noise when she eats. This is, this is me. This is what I do. I\\'m gonna end up alone, just like he did.  Our trains are on the same track, ok? Yeah, sure, I\\'m coming up 30 years behind him, but the stops are all the same. Bitter Town. Aloneville. Hermit Junction.  What if I never find someone? Or worse, what if I\\'ve found her, but I dumped her because she pronounced it \"supposably\"?  How do you know that? How?  You\\'ll see, you guys are all gonna go off and get married, and I\\'m gonna end up alone. Will you promise me something? When you\\'re married, will you invite me over for holidays?  Yeah, I understand.  You know what? I\\'m not gonna end up like this. I\\'ll see you man.  Yes, Janice. Why is that so difficult for you to comprehend?  Yes. She was smart, she was pretty, and she honestly cared about me. Janice is my last chance to have somebody.  Oh, my, god!  Janice, you\\'re--  Is it--?  Congratulations.  You couldn\\'t have told me about this on the phone?  Neat. I\\'m gonna die alone.  Janice was my safety net, ok? And now I have to get a snake.  If I\\'m gonna be an old, lonely man, I\\'m gonna need a thing, you know, a hook, like that guy on the subway who eats his own face. So I figure I\\'ll be Crazy Man with a Snake, y=know. Crazy Snake Man. And I\\'ll get more snakes, call them my babies, kids will walk past my place, they will run. \"Run away from Crazy Snake Man,\" they\\'ll shout!  Of course I am. I reject anyone who\\'s crazy enough to actually go out with me, and then I bitch about the fact that there aren\\'t any great women out there.  In a bad way?  Whoa! Don\\'t know about that.  Hey. Well, you will all be pleased to know that I have a date tomorrow night. This woman, Alison, from work. She\\'s great. She\\'s pretty, she\\'s smart. And uh, I\\'ve been holding off on asking her out in the past, because she has an unusually large head. But, I\\'m not gonna let that stuff hang me up anymore. Look at me. I\\'m growing.  I\\'ll take that.  Yeah, yeah. Some people said some nice things about him. I think somebody should have it.  Takin\\' that with you, huh?  Yeah, jus\\' second. Good-bye Mr. Heckles. We\\'ll try to keep it down.  Wow, what a geek. They spent $69.95 on a Wonder Mop.  Well, that\\'s what we said about Joey...  How about Joey... Pepponi?  Joey... Switzerland?  Joe...Joe...Joe...Stalin?  Well, it does not ring a bell with me...  Might wanna try Joseph.  Oh yes! Bye Bye Birdie, starring Joseph Stalin. Joseph Stalin is the Fiddler on the Roof.  She\\'s not gonna make you wear one of those big plastic cones, is she?  So what does this mean?  I don\\'t get it, I mean, you just got him. How can he be an adult already?  I know that one! ...No, that\\'s Popes into a Volkswagen.  Yeah, but that\\'s like two blocks away from the beach. I mean, it\\'s a total party zoo.  What?  Ah. Your own brand of vigilante justice.  ...Take off their hats!  You\\'re kidding.  Y\\'know, you\\'d think I would\\'ve.  ...He\\'s in.  Okay, bye, champ. Now, I know there\\'s gonna be a lot of babes in San Diego, but remember, there\\'s also a lot to learn.  No Rach, it’s not just you. My thirtieth birthday certainly wasn’t that much fun.  Ross, a sports car? Wouldn’t it have been cheaper to just stuff a sock down there?  Hey-hey are you drunk?  Okay, here is the thing. We have thrown a very formal surprise party for you in there! All of your friends are in there and your parents!  Yes!  Yes!!  Okay, here’s the thing. We’re gonna get you some coffee and they will never know that you’re drunk.  Yeah, I’ll take care of it.  That’s still yours. Okay, now remember it’s a surprise party. So, when you go in, act surprised.  Okay.  Okay before we start the celebration, Monica has to go put on her party dress.  Monica’s a little drunk.  Monica’s wasted.  Okay, open ours next. Open ours next!  No-no-no-no! That was the joke!  No, because you’re not a grandmother!  Pheebs!!  What?  Okay, here we go.  Hey! How’d it go?  Well, here we are, just a bunch of thirty year olds.  Yeah, I think for us, kissing is pretty much like an opening act, y\\'know? I mean it\\'s like the stand-up comedian you have to sit through before Pink Floyd comes out.  The problem is, though, after the concert\\'s over, no matter how great the show was, you girls are always looking for the comedian again, y\\'know? I mean, we\\'re in the car, we\\'re fighting traffic... basically just trying to stay awake.  Oh, I think this is the episode of Three\\'s Company where there\\'s some kind of misunderstanding.  Yes, and we all know how cruel a parent can be about the flatness of a child\\'s pillow.  Ugly Naked Guy got a Thighmaster!  You don\\'t get a lot of \\'doy\\' these days...  ...Dinah?  Now, Monica, you know that\\'s not how you look for an engagement ring in a lasagne...  Boys? We\\'re going in.  Kinda puts that whole pillow thing in perspective, huh, Mon?  I mean presumably, the biggest part of your job is done.  What does she do?  Well, no, although I did have an imaginary friend, who... my parents actually preferred.  I dunno, but.. I think it\\'s about to attack the Enterprise.  You!  Oh, I can uh, check that for ya.  I can check that for ya.  Well… we-we do. You can only eat Tic Tacks in even numbers.  Okay, ten bucks says that we can name every item in that bag.  Yes!  Diet soda.  Orange juice.  Well, we used there’s up last night making scary faces.  All right! Ten buck! Fork it over! Cough it up! Pay the piper! Gimme it.  Fears and Pet Peeves.  His legs flail about as if independent of his body!  She has a real name.  Althea?! What are you doing?!  You\\'re shooting with Althea?!  Nice shooting!  Actually, it’s Miss Chinandolor Bong.  Unfortunately that is correct.  I majored in lightning rounds. All right, we’re gonna destroy you.  Well, I’m so confused as to what we’ve been doing so far…  Say 200?  But if we win, we get your apartment.  Dangerous Liaisons.  Fancy.  Fancy guest.  Thanks man.  You can’t just call Monica’s room.  Oh, I would never bet this apartment. It’s too nice.  Hey!  Yeah, but I bet it works.  Well believe it baby!  I knew it!  Cool, girl roommate.  Would you all stop yelling in our apartment! You are ruining moving day for us!  What?! What-what is it?!  I can’t believe we live here!  What\\'s this?  Well, I don\\'t know what Big Leon told ya but it\\'s an even thousand if you want me for the whole night. What is this for?  Well, thanks man. Now I can get my pony.  I don\\'t know. It\\'s a bracelet.  I so am.  Well, it\\'ll probably slow it down at first but, once I get used to the extra weight, I\\'ll be back on track.  Well, I\\'m guessing he wants to do a little dance. . . ya know, make a little love. . . well pretty much get down tonight.  Oh, she\\'s goin\\' somewhere.  Hey, you feelin\\' better?  That thing, it\\'s a uhh. . . yeah it\\'s, it\\'s a little flashy.  No, I\\'m alright, thanks.  Well, doesn\\'t the fact that I wore the bracelet even though I hated it say something about our friendship and how much it means to me?  I can\\'t believe it.  Hey.  Well this one\\'s for you.  That\\'s what they\\'ll call us.  Oh, I thought that\\'s what they used to cover Connecticut when it rained.  OK, I was wrong, that\\'s what they used to cover Connecticut.  Ahh, so how many cameras are actually on you?  Work on your music?  Hey, you know who used to have nails like that?  Isn’t this amazing?  Okay. Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  B-bye!  Yeah, I know, but all of those little annoying things she did before we fell in love? Like her voice, her laugh, her personality—Well, they’re all back! Y’know? And she’s picked up like nine new ones!  Yes, I-I know that you do, but I think one of the reasons people were complaining though, was that they paid to hear the actor sing Old Man River.  Right! I just think that this is happening too soon.  No! No! Not, Paris.  I don’t know exactly.  But I do know that it’s some time tomorrow.  Y’know uh, you didn’t really have to help me pack.  Well, I-I thought I did but, I-I guess I did not!  Oh, I’m packing. Y’know I’m-I’m packing ‘cause I’m moving to Yemen tomorrow.  I’m only going to pretend I’m moving to Yemen, it’s the only way I can get rid off her.  Y’know you, really didn’t have to take me to the airport.  Oh no-no-no, no. No, no, no, I just, I just need a pretend ticket.  What would you give to a kid if he wanted a ticket to play with?  Well, I-I guess I gotta go.  Well, just until we find an energy source to replace fuel.  Okay, good-bye. Good-bye.  No!  Janice! There you are! There you are! I had to have one last kiss, and also-also you said that you were going to leave right after I got on the plane!  Well, as old as he is in dog years, do you think Snoopy should still be allowed to fly this thing?  Excuse me little one, I have a very solid backhand.  I was shrieking... like a Marine.  Yes. Yes, and ah, ah, the trees are happy too, because for most of them, it’s the only chance to see New York.  Ahh, do you have any coconut flavoured deities?  How... exactly are you pursuing that? Y\\'know other than sending out resumes like what, two years ago?  He’s right, if you quit this job, you then have motivation to go after a job you really want.  Because, I’m too afraid.  Yeah, that’d be much worse than being 28, and still working here.  I spelled out boobies.  So, how many have you sold so far?  Oh my God, how did you do that?  Me! On my computer.  Eh, yeah, well ah, waitress at a coffee shop and cheer squad co-captain only took up so much room.  Something else I might have said?  You-you-you don’t wanna give into the fear.  Tell us what happened, Brown Bird Ross.  Y\\'know what Rach, maybe you should just, y\\'know stay here at the coffee house.  Well seeing that drunk Santa wet himself, really perked up my Christmas.  It’s like ‘Night of the Living Dead Christmas Trees.’  Sure, everybody loves a kidder.  I’m an alien. I’m an alien.  You know, I\\'d love to, but I\\'m a little tired.  You\\'re on!  He could be alone. This morning I heard him do push-ups, and then talk to his triceps.  She\\'s cheating on Joey with Ross!  Wow!  How about the dinosaur twins in the other room? No-one is manning that wall!  Anything?  You do realise that\\'s your brother?  That\\'s not true. I came with Monica and I\\'m leaving with Weird Al.  Okay Buckwheat!  And she\\'s... turning on the TV... and watching... Miss Congeniality!  You got it!  Okay, well we\\'ll go back in there, but will you do one thing for us? The people that care about you?  Enunciate!  Hey!  Not quite. Monica\\'s still at the salon, and I\\'m just finishing packing.  You\\'re not supposed to take that. Besides, it\\'s a New Testament, what are you gonna do with it?  Hey!... aaaaaahhhh!  I think.... I think I can see your scalp.  What d\\'ya know... It\\'s a treat for the eyes and the ears.  Yeah, it\\'s almost if Air Barbados doesn\\'t care about your social life.  Wish I could switch with someone. I really don\\'t wanna sit with Allen Iverson over there.  You go back to work tomorrow night, right?  So if you want people to see them, then by definition you\\'re not having them taken out... say, at the break of dawn?  What are you singing?  It\\'s \"Ride of the Valkyries\" from \"Apocalypse Now\"... See, here\\'s the thing: The corn rose were really a solution to your frizzy hair problem. And now that we\\'re home, we don\\'t have that problem anymore, so if you think about it... I hate them!  Did I? Let\\'s refresh. I believe what I said was that I could see your scalp.  Again, let\\'s journey back... As I recall what Rachel said, was she had never notice the shape of your skull before. And Joey... Well, Joey didn\\'t realise that there was anything different.  Hit yourself in the tooth?  Honey, you\\'ve been in there for a long time... Is everything okay?  Really? What happened?  You can\\'t move at all?  If I untangle you, will you please get rid of the corn rose?  Now that I untangled you, how \\'bout you doing a little something for me?  I think you know.  This is what I want to do.  \\'Cause he was just so darn cute.  Hey, what did your agent say?  And I\\'ll be using his dead body as a shield.  I may have.  Well, we haven\\'t exactly met, we just stayed up all night talking on the internet.  I like this girl, okay, I seriously like this girl, you now how sometimes I tend get a little defended and quipy...  Well she totally called me on it, okay. She said, \\'cut it out, get real\\', and I did.  It\\'s like this, me, no jokes.  Well, I think you should seriously consider the marriage thing, give Rachel another chance to dress up like Princess Bubble Yum.  Joey, no means no!  I\\'m sorry we, we don\\'t have your sheep.  I\\'m afraid I might just be.  Okay, it\\'s not a guy, all right, I know her.  How do you not fall down more?  I can\\'t believe she\\'s married.  What\\'s wrong? What\\'s wrong? You\\'re married that\\'s what\\'s wrong.  What?  Hey, look, Phoebe I wanted to meet her in person too, okay, but she\\'s married, she has a husband.  Okay, I\\'ll do it!  Hey!  I’ll give up my ticket.  And I think Ross is generous too.  Hey!  Ross.  Phoebe and Rachel! So the people that knew about our wedding before me were you, Phoebe and Rachel, Heldi, and apparently some band called Starlight Magic 7 who are available by the way!  Okay.  Yes, if it really doesn’t mean anything, because you know that I’m just not ready…  Totally.  Yeah, it’s beautiful.  I know.  Oh my God!  I’m gonna miss being able to afford food.  Yeah well, too bad we’re gonna have to return them.  I have you.  Hey-hey.  Now sweetie, I know you don’t like my office parties, but you can wear your new boots. See? Every cloud has a…supple leather lining.  Why not?  Do you think I work at some kind of boot pricing company?  You said that you paid all that money because those boots go with skirts, dresses, and pants!  Okay.  Y’know, that party wasn’t bad.  I don’t see any uh, cabs. Maybe we should just walk?  What honey, it’s like fifteen blocks to the subway. Let’s go.  What’s going on?  What?  Hop on.  Honey, I know you’re in pain right now, but I’m a little turned on.  Okay, ten blocks down. Five to go.  Oh I’m sorry! Do you need a break?  I can see it from right here. It’ll cost you one husband.  Well, why don’t you check in one of my saddlebags while I chew on a bale of hay!  Honey, are you seriously ever gonna wear the boots again?  Y’know what? You can say goodbye to the tan ones.  You\\'re flingin\\'-flangin\\' right I am!  Well, it\\'s official there are no good movies.  Hey, man. What\\'s up?  Well, I\\'ll tell ya I do enjoy guilt, but, ah, it wasn\\'t me.  Is anybody else scared?  Get the woman a pad! Get the woman a pad! A pad! A pad!  Okay, last night at dinner, when the meals came, she put half her chicken piccata on my plate and took my tomatoes.  Noo.  No, it\\'s like all of the sudden, we were this couple. And this alarm started going off in my head: \\'Run for your life! Get out of the building!\\'  Look what do I do? I wanna get past this, I don\\'t wanna be afraid of the commitment thing. I wanna go through the tunnel, to the other side!  You think?  Yeah, Joe, I assure you if I\\'m staring down the barrel of a gun, I\\'m pretty much peeing every which way.  Yes, I did. Yes, I did. Because, you\\'re my girlfriend, and that\\'s what girlfriends should, should get.  Well, not me. But that\\'s what\\'s happened, and, ah, and, and there\\'s more. We should take a trip.  Yep, we\\'re a couple and that\\'s what couples do. And, I wanna meet your parents. We should take a trip with your parents!  I am, I actually am. I mean this is amazing. My entire life I have feared this place, and now that I\\'m here it\\'s like what was the big deal. I could probably say \\'Let\\'s move in together.\\' and I\\'d be okay.  It doesn\\'t scare me!  So, I finally catch up to her and she says this relationship is going to fast and we have to slow down.  Then I got all needy and clingy.  She said she\\'d call me.  Oh God.  This ice cream tastes like crap by the way.  So, you don\\'t think I\\'m terminal?  Okay, okay. So, should I call her?  So I\\'m not, not gonna lose her?  I said, \\'So I\\'m not gonna lose her?\\'  Well, I\\'m sorry if my friends aren\\'t as sophisticated as yours.  Here in Chelsea.  A woman\\'s  Can I be that guy?  ....And then I just, you know, threw the bag of barley at her, and ran out of the store.  I\\'ve actually ruined this haven\\'t I? It\\'s time for the good ice cream now, right?  Hello!  Ahh, Hotties of the Paleontology Department, there’s a big selling calendar, eh?  A hot girl’s at stake and all of the sudden he’s Rain Man.  Oh, is that against the rules?  I see.  Oh yeah, Dana Keystone. She was in my Movement class.  Oh, I don’t know man. I haven’t talked to her in like ten years.  You do owe me so much. You owe me three thousand, four hundred…  Oh okay, I’ll-I’ll try.  Yeah so, Tuesday?  You just thought of that in there?  What are you smiling about? What is so funny?  How’s your room Rach?  Have you figured out what started the fire Mr. Fireman?  God, it’s great to catch up! I can’t believe how long it’s been!  Hi.  Honey, it is not a date! I haven’t talked to her in ten years! You can’t just call up somebody you haven’t talked to in ten years and ask them for a favor. There are rules, y’know? You gotta, you got to put in some time.  No, we only went out once.  Not once!  Yeah, I’ve always hated that Howie.  The nerve huh?  Refill?  I couldn’t do it.  Hey, relax I just need more time. We’re going to dinner tonight.  Uh, Dana Keystone from college.  No, that was Dana Caplin.  Great story again! The yarns that you weave! Woo-hoo-hoo!  Oh no-no-no! Stay! Stay! Because you-you should you-you-you should stay!  Oh no-no-no, that’s not—No-no-no!  No-no—Really?!  Well maybe there is one thing you can do.  Well, I umm, I mean this is just off the top of my head now, umm but I have this friend. This actor friend and he would kill me if he thought I was doing this umm, but umm would it be possible for him to get an audition for your movie say on Thursday?  Really?  Hey!  So?!  It’s Thursday! How was the audition?!  What?  Okay, let me just jump in and ask, at what point did you think this was a successful marriage?  Ross, just for my own piece of mind, you’re not married to anymore of us are ya?  You left a shoe here?!  Oh good, when he comes back for his keys, I’ll be sure to give him your shoe.  Whoa-whoa-whoa! What?  Yeah, I’m gonna pass. ‘Cause I was kinda iffy when it was puppies.  See that’s where I think that you’re wrong. We’ve been playing these babies man for man; we should really be playing a zone defense.  Okay, I’m a rookie. I should not be in the end zone.  Hey!  Shocking! Since you still have the keys.  What equity investments?  You don’t even have a car!  And?  There you are.  He can do more than that! He can destroy the universe!  They’re not gonna swallow anything, you guys are being way over protective. When I was a kid, my mom used to just throw me into a pile of broken glass!  I swallowed the sonic blaster gun.  But you found the keys to his clothes?  That is true.  Ahh, I think it just moved. It’s really poking me.  I think that’s gum.  Okay, listen this really hurts. Let’s go.  Well, let’s just say that Krog will be fully equipped to destroy the universe again in twelve to fourteen hours.  And protected them from a tornado?  Was the setting of Phoebe’s triumph.  Is not as important as the fact that Phoebe took care of the babies all by herself.  Ohh. Mmm.  Hey, you have got to try this cheesecake.  I—no! I didn\\'t read the box before I opened it. And you can\\'t return a box after you\\'ve opened the box.  Because it\\'s too delicious.  So…  Oh, what’s at 8:00?  Well, maybe since the age of 9, Frannie’s made some new friends.  Another cheesecake came! They delivered it to the wrong address again!  I can’t seem to say goodbye.  Well I’ve forgotten what it tastes like okay?!  Good idea. Where do you want to go to lunch?  Well, thank you for lunch.  By then, the cheesecake may have gone bad. We don’t want her to come back to bad cheesecake.  Well, we don’t want that.  But we should take it.  Why?  I’m full, and yet I know if I stop eating this, I’ll regret it.  What are you doing tonight?  Oh really? Uh, Monica said she had a date at 9:00.  That’s what Monica said.  Are you eating the cheesecake without me?!  Oh yes!  Oh yes!  Oh yes! Oh yes!  Well that’s not fair, you’ve already had some!  What do we use to split it?  Stick to your side!  What are you crazy? That\\'s a baby!  Hey, you\\'re gonna be fine. You\\'re one of the most caring, most responsible men in North America. You\\'re gonna make a great dad.  Well, only if you order stuff.  There it is! So what\\'re you gonna do?  And your friend Phoebe?  Man, if you tried something like that on my birthday, you\\'d be starin\\' at the business end of a hissy fit.  Alright, what have we learned so far?  Did you see Betty?  Okay, worst case scenario. Say you never feel like a father.  Say your son never feels connected to you, as one. Say all of his relationships are affected by this.  You know, you think I would.  What\\'s up with the simian?  No, no, you got zero points for \\'IDNEY\\'.  Marcel swallowed a Scrabble tile.  We think he was trying to spell out \\'MONKEY.\\'  Hey, come on, you came through, you did what you had to do. That is very dad.  So he has to be a male who has at least $50.  So, why is she leaving? Is it a school night and she has a lot of homework to do?  Oh, tell her good luck with that.  Yeah. Do we have any Fruit Roll-Ups?  Oh that’s so funny because we found someone too.  Why would our guy be a weirdo?  A face ass?  No, our guy is just a floating head.  Our guy has great hair.  Our guy smells incredible.  Hey.  Well, you…don’t look good Joe.  That’s still in there?!  Is this a service you’re providing me?  Our new fridge? I don’t live here anymore.  Uh-huh.  Just tell her the truth! Tell her you’re not ready.  Then you distract her with a Barbie doll.  Joey, I saw you push him!  Uh-huh.  Hey!  Yeah.  Are you sure?! Because our guy smells incredible!  Are you funny?  Yeah, but Sebastian? What is that? A cat’s name?  Okay, so you will meet our guys?  Okay now it doesn’t matter which one you choose, y’know? It’s completely up to you. Our guy is perfect, or you can go out with the guy Phoebe deemed not good enough to go out with herself.  You know the hotels?  Well, maybe you don’t marry this one.  Good-good-good-good.  Hey!  So what was it for anyway?  Yeah.  All right Joey, be nice.  So does he have a hump? A hump and a hairpiece?  Sounds like a date to me.  Alright, so I\\'m back in high school, I\\'m standing in the middle of the cafeteria, and I realize I am totally naked.  Then I look down, and I realize there\\'s a phone... there.  That\\'s right.  All of a sudden, the phone starts to ring. Now I don\\'t know what to do, everybody starts looking at me.  Finally, I figure I\\'d better answer it, and it turns out it\\'s my mother, which is very-very weird, because- she never calls me!  Cookie?  Please don\\'t do that again, it\\'s a horrible sound.  Ooh, this is a Dear Diary moment.  I\\'m sorry, I didn\\'t catch your name. Paul, was it?  It\\'s a beautiful thing.  I would have to say that is an \\'L\\'-shaped bracket.  I have no idea.  All finished!  Yes, please don\\'t spoil all this fun.  Oh, God.  Oh my God!  Look, Ross, you gotta understand, between us we haven\\'t had a relationship that has lasted longer than a Mento.   You, however have had the love of a woman for four years.   Four years of closeness and sharing at the end of which she ripped your heart out, and that is why we don\\'t do it!  I don\\'t think that was my point!  Angela\\'s the screamer, Andrea has cats.  That is amazing.  If can invade Poland, there isn\\'t anything I can\\'t do.  Hi, Paul, is it?  All right, kids, I gotta get to work. If I don\\'t input those numbers,... it doesn\\'t make much of a difference...  \\'Look, Gippetto, I\\'m a real live boy.\\'  And yet you\\'re surprisingly upbeat.  Oh, how well you know me...  Did you make it, or are you just serving it?  Okay, so, I\\'m in Las Vegas... I\\'m Liza Minelli-  Wow, it\\'s, it\\'s like porno for clowns.  Or maybe she doesn\\'t steal stuff and Joey just slept with her and never called her back.  Ya know, my cousin went to hell on a football scholarship.  Why her mom?  Excuse me?  This isn\\'t your first surprise party, is it sir?  So, basically just a Chinese guy.  Yes because uh, you look so young.  NO! No, I\\'ll take that for ya.  Ok, think, what would Jack and Chrissy do?  Uhh, yes, absdolutely, um. Why again?  Yeah, this more than anything else, is the staging area.  Well, we could count again.  Look, are you gonna be ok?  Well, actually just one birthday flan.  It\\'s a traditional Mexican custard dessert...Look talk to Monica, she\\'s on the food committee.  Joey, Joey. Hey, some girl just walked up to me and said, \\'I want you Dennis,\\' and stuck her tounge down my throat. I love this party.  Volleyball.  Joey, a woman just stuck her tounge down my throat, I\\'m not even listening to you.  Well, I relied on a carefully regimented program of denial and, and wetting the bed.  Becasue it reminded you of the way our forefathers used to bitch at each other?  Well, uh, Dr. Greene, where are you going?  Sorry, we\\'re on a major flan high.  Yup, get ready for the gelatenous fun.  No-no-no-no, I\\'ve supported you one hundred percent and I want to prove that to you in person!  Forgive me? You haven\\'t been taking my calls in a week!  Uh, what was that?  I know. Can you believe it? One year ago today I was just your annoying friend Chandler.  Huh.  Oh, but it\\'s not \\'til tomorrow!  Okay.  Wow!  Do we have to?  Okay this is great, but Joey said he didn\\'t want any of us out there.  Yeah, I think we should see other people.  Yes.  I said art lover.  I don\\'t know, I\\'m very tired.  So it\\'s pretty much the same Pheebs.  Yeah, I guess it\\'s a little better now.  Can I give you a present now?  How do you feel about the, \"I really did forgot the present, please forgive me\" not fake out?  Ohh that\\'s the worse thing that can happen on an anniversary ever!  What-what Richard thing?  What Richard thing?  Oh my God.  Love your condoms my man.  Why?! What happened?!  No-no, that\\'s okay, apparently there\\'s a new policy where we don\\'t have to share everything with everybody.  No! Her boyfriend Richard!  When you go lunching with hunky moustache men and don\\'t tell me about it!  There\\'s not gonna be a next time! You can not ever see him again!  That\\'s so funny, because I think I just did!  Fine with me!  What are you talking…  Really?  Whoa!  Good luck!  I see.  What\\'s an identical hand twin?  Again I must go back to, how?  No! No! I support you 100%! I just didn\\'t, I didn\\'t get it right away. Y\\'know now I\\'m caught up! Identical hand twins! It\\'s a million-dollar idea!  No!  That was Joey!  Yeah, well, she\\'s probably talking to Richard.  Really?  What does it look like? I\\'m going home.  Really?!  Yeah, I wanted to make a dramatic scene, but I hate packing.  Yes! I\\'ve-I\\'ve never seen a roll like this in my life!  Okay, ah umm, ah, a 8. Ah, a 6?  8. 8!  If you get this one, we buy everybody here a steak dinner!  Noo!  Ahh, ooh, try a hard 8.  Two fours.  Another hard 8.  You roll another hard eight and we get married here tonight.  Yes! I love you! I\\'ve never loved anybody as much as I love you.  Okay, so if an eight comes up, we take it as a sign and we do it! {Whoa! Where have I heard that before? Matthew Perry talking about signs in Las Vegas. I guess it must\\'ve been some movie I saw.} What do you say?  Okay! Come on! Let\\'s go! All right!  All right!  Here it is! Here it is!  It\\'s a four.  Ohh, great, I have condom in my wallet I\\'ve had since I was twelve.  I don\\'t think so.  No, we\\'ll-we\\'ll bring it back! Just put it under your dress.  Hello! One marriage please!  Oh, that\\'s The Wedding March. Does, does that freak you out?  I didn\\'t know it was a big secret.  You bitch.  C\\'mon, there\\'s nothin\\' to see, it\\'s just a tiny bump, it\\'s totally useless.  Joey was in a porno movie.  If I\\'m goin\\' down, I\\'m takin\\' everybody with me.  Why yes Ross, pressing my third nipple opens the delivery entrance to the magical land of Narnia.  Huh? Are, uh, any of these cultures, per chance, in the tri-state area?  No, no the gravel capades. Yeah, the turns aren\\'t as fast but when Snoopy falls. . . funny.  Oh I see, I see, because of the third nipple thing. Ha ha ha ha. . .  Uh, Julie.  Sorry, you had a paleontologist on your face. But, uh, it\\'s gone now, you\\'re alright.  What\\'s this in my pocket? Why it\\'s Joey\\'s porno movie.  OK, now wait a minute. That is the craziest typing test I\\'ve ever seen.  Nice work my friend.  Well, listen, this has been great but I\\'m officially wiped.  I got the time to get to know Julie.  I\\'m goin\\' home.  So did Monica tell you about this great band called the Swing Kings that we’re trying to get to play at the wedding?  Oh since forever! I used to go all over town listening to bands!  Do you want me to call?  Staying out of the way.  Sure! That’s one of the great things about being engaged. I’m not nervous talking to pretty girls anymore.  So Ross, how was your date the other night? Did you tell her about the magical ride that starts with the flush of every toilet?  Huh.  Hey!  Uh Joe, when it’s one o’clock in the morning and you don’t come by? That’s okay!  Really? Right across the street?  When’d you meet her?  Excellent! Y’know Ross met somebody too!  Hi! How’d it go?  But I love swing music!  Look all I know is when Monica and I went to see them, we had fun! And there’s another reason too.  I don’t want to say.  Well it’s just while Monica and I were dancing to them it was…the first time I knew that…you were the woman I wanted to dance all my dances with.  Hi, honey! I’m home!  Why? Do you another boyfriend in there or something?  Y’know it’s funny I started it but, now it’s scary me. So could you come out here please?  Oh you got a wedding dress? That’s great!  Well then why can’t I see it?  Yeah, that’s like the most ugliest dress I’ve ever seen. Wh-why do you to return it?  Oh that’s great! Great! Thanks! But that dress I mean it’s like yuck! It’s terrible! It makes me wanna just rip it right off of you!  Okay!  Oh, uhm... I have to work too. Yeah, I\\'m stuck at the office all day.  Those are all really old!  Hi!  I was in the car with Nancy all day.  Well, at least the perfume is not mine, be thankful for that!  It’s perfect. It’s everything we’ve been looking for.  And the fireplace in the bedroom.  This is bringing out a lovely color in you!  I don’t know. What do you think?  I do too.  I know.  I don’t know what you mean, giant talking cigarette! Oh, by the way, Phoebe called just as I was getting into Nancy’s car, so if she asks you, I was at work all day.  We don’t. Not until it\\'s a hundred percent. I mean, why upset everybody over nothing.  I know. Gooooood luck with it.  Hey!  Is it me, or have the greetings gone downhill around here?  ...and a street where our kids can ride their bikes and maybe an ice-cream truck can go by.  Actually, we already found a house we love.  Bet you wish I was having an affair now, huh?  I know this is really hard and we\\'re really sorry.  Hey, that\\'s...\\'joincidence\\' with a \\'C\\'!  If you win, we give up the birds.  But if we win, we get your apartment.  Dangerous Liaisons.  Fancy.  Fancy guest.  Thanks man.  Would you all stop yelling in our apartment! You are ruining moving day for us!  Well, I think, I think Ross knows about me and Monica.  Look, we\\'re not just messing around! I love her. Okay, I\\'m in love with her.  Sure!  Little toast here. I know this isn\\'t exactly the kind of Thanksgiving that all of you all planned, but for me, this has been really great, you know, I think because it didn\\'t involve divorce or projectile vomiting. Anyway, I was just thinking, I mean, if you\\'d gone to Vail, and if you guys\\'d been with your family, if you didn\\'t have syphilis and stuff, we wouldn\\'t be all together, you know? So I guess what I\\'m trying to say is that I\\'m very thankful that all of your Thanksgivings sucked.  Here, here!  Hello? It\\'s Nancy, they responded to our offer.  I know.  That\\'s okay, we understand.  Yeah... Well, it\\'s a good thing we got it then.  We got the house.  I just didn\\'t want to tell you in front of them.  We\\'re growing up.  So who\\'s gonna tell them?  Not it! Damn it!  You\\'ll see.  Well, I didn\\'t know how to tell you before, but... We got the house.  Yeah, because if I was at my old job we\\'d say 300 million? No thank you!  Still on Amelia Earhart?  Yes but there\\'s six of us so we\\'d only have to get struck by lightning 7 times.  Kinda like Joey.  Pie eating contest?  No, I saw a picture of you covered in blueberries.  One of the slots got filled.  Sense the tone! No that kid Nate got it.  Yeah I know.  Yeah...I mean I want this so much! I mean, I wanna get one, I want my friend Charlie to get one...Except I don\\'t care about Charlie.  I can see the headline now: \"Lottery winners\\' friend filled with regret eats own arm\".  Well you wouldn\\'t, but we own the paper, we can print whatever we want.  Ok, so now that you\\'re in, what are you gonna do if we win?  Ooh! Calm down ...  You know, I\\'m not sure a sports team is the way to go.  You\\'re right, it has been you dream for over 15 seconds.  Well no, Charlie\\'s gonna get that.  He\\'s the boss\\'s son.  What about the ones you have on the nightstand?  Yes there are, I just saw them a few minutes ago.  Honey, there are like 20 tickets on the nightstand!  Oh, yeah! Thanks for inventing the lottery!  Can I come a little bit closer, valuable things are getting squished...  This is..shhh!  Oh, is she related to Ralph Lauren?  I got that!  No.  Oh no no no no, I\\'d love to be somebody\\'s assistant! Answering phones, getting coffee, I live for that stuff! And I\\'m not too mature... farts, boobies, butt cracks!  Me, that guy who just said butt cracks?  Does that mean I get the good loving tonight?  Thanks, man.  Really? What?  Wow, you\\'d think we should get that over 20 years or go for the big payout.  Me too.  Yeah, it’s two guys in a ring, and the rules are: “They’re are no rules.”  Yes, but there’s two in martini, soo everybody back to my office.  Oh it’s Bing, sir. I’m sorry , I was just ah...  Thank you! Today, my boss keep slapping my butt and he was acting like it was no big deal.  Well, I didn’t do anything. I didn’t want to be the guy who has a problem with his boss slapping his bottom.  Yeah, I know, for a really great stew you just y\\'know, stick your head in between ‘em.  Well, that’s not true, he-he smacked you once.  No sir.  Nine times! Okay, I had to put on lotion! But, it’s gonna be okay, because as of tomorrow I’m conducting an experiment, and if all goes as planned, my butt will be smack free.  No, I ah, I didn’t do them.  No, no I just ah, didn’t do them. Instead, I ah, hung out with a couple of friends and had a couple of beers so I certainly don’t deserve any praise, verbal or otherwise.  Doug!!  I’m a little bit uncomfortable with the that way you express yourself.  No, no. It-it’s not about the swearing, it’s more about ah, the way, that you ah, occasionally, concentrate, your enthusiasm on my buttock.  Oh, and don’t get me wrong, I appreciate the sentiment. It’s just that I, I have a rather, sensitive posterior, and ah, besides, it’s making all the other guys jealous.  Thank you, sir.  No. No, not at all, that’s-that’s ridiculous.  Ye-ye-yeah, yes I do!  Run! Run you crazy, rich freak!  This coming from the man who couldn’t split our 80 dollar phone bill in half.  Hey, what are you doing here? Shouldn’t you be at work?  I’m so sorry you’re sick.  I’m gonna grab you some tissue.  Yes?  Oh my God, introduce us!  Yeah, I don’t you should say that even when you’re healthy.  Don’t take this personally okay? It’s just that I just can’t have sex with a sick person.  That’s the thing, see I would like to stay in the pribe of mwha-ah-libe.  Oh Jeez honey, I thought, I thought you were asleep.  Would you please get some rest!  Really? Struck down in the pribe of libe!  No-no-no-no-no-no-no, you are not getting me this way.  No-no-no-no-no!  Okay.  So you’re just, kinda rubbing it on yourself?  It’s nice.  Oh come on you big faker!  Well that was before all the vaporizing action.  We got some Vap-O-Rub in some places.  He’s taking off her coat!  Well, how do you find clothes that fit?  Ok, that\\'s Eric.  Ok, this could be tough.  Ooh, you almost had it.  Hey.  Your boyfriend is so cool.  Yeah, he let us drive his Jaguar. Joey for 12 blocks, me for 15.  I think they get it.  There\\'s the man.  Just tryin\\' somethin\\' here, ya know.  Hey listen, we\\'ve gotta go, I promised Richard we\\'d meet him downstairs.  Yeah, didn\\'t he tell ya?  You hear that? We\\'re the guys.  Uh, yeah, I just got my pick-up sticks back from the shop. Bring your nerves of steel.  Kick save and... denied.  Oh really, I didn\\'t know they had foosball in the 1800\\'s.  See, that\\'s why we don\\'t let her play.  Oh hey listen, don\\'t be mad at him, it\\'s our fault. I\\'m sorry we\\'ve been hoggin so much of his time.  No.  Your just, your just clearly not familiar with our young persons vernacular. See, when we say dad, we mean buddy. We mean pal.  No no, seriously, Joey\\'s my dad, Monica\\'s my dad. I\\'ve even got some dads down at work.  You\\'re not a dad. You\\'re not a dad.  Hey.  Monica and I are engaged.  Thanks.  To Monica!  So when you said, \"Get up early,\" did you mean 1986?  Okay.  Know what I mean?  There’s gonna be a wedding. You’re gonna be the bride. Two hundred people are going to be looking at you in a clean white dress.  You look great!  You okay over there?  Oh, don’t worry about it I mean you probably were tired, you had a lot of champagne, it happens to everybody.  Yes, on a scale from 1 to 10, 10 being the dumbest a person can look, you are definitely 19.  Young! You’re a man-child okay?! Now go get changed because everybody’s ready and please, oh please, keep my underwear!  Joe?  Uhh, you’ve had a lot of sex right?  Well, it’s just the reason that I’m asking is because I kind of eh, uh, I was unable to—I mean I really wanted too, but I couldn’t…. There huh—hmm, there-there was an incident.  It’s happened to you?  Well, what’d you do?  What?!  Yes, you can pass for 19.  Yes!  Seriously? Seriously, no! You can play your own age which is 31!  Now Monica, I know you’re upset, but don’t forget. There is going to be a wedding, you are going to throw the bouquet, and then there’s going to be a honeymoon, maybe in Paris.  Then we will sprinkle rose pedals on the bed and make love. Not just because it’s romantic, but because I can!  Okay, don’t say anything, you might scare it away.  It’s Paris, who knows we’re here!  Pheebs, we’re not giving you a deposit for our wedding!  Oh, give her the deposit! Give her the ring! I don’t care!  How is that ever going to happen?!  Thanks.  It could’ve been worse, he could’ve shot her.  Hey.  Oh wow, I hope you don’t take this the wrong way but, I know we had plans to meet up tonight and, ugh, I’m just kinda worried about what it might do to our friendship.  Seven times!  In a foreign, romantic country…  Well, I don’t see that we have a choice. But, when we’re back home, we don’t do it.  Y’know, I saw a wine cellar downstairs…  Okay!  Forget it, that’s off.  The man’s got a point.  Listen, in the middle of everything if I scream the word, \"Yippee!\" just ignore me.  Oh, hello Rachel.  Yes, we do. But, we have to change first.  Yeah, we’ll be down in like five minutes.  Oh, yay…  Wow, you look…  Well, I’ve got a girl in here.  Well, we’re-we’re hanging out in here!  Well, I suppose I’d have to say you!! But, what if we’re watching a movie in here?  Well, Ross and Emily aren’t gonna use it.  Oh Mon-Mon-Mon-Mon-look, this is the honeymoon suite. The room expects sex. The room would be disappointed if it didn’t get sex. All of the other honeymoon suites would think it was a loser.  Okay!  Nope, not under here!  Well, you couldn’t have looked everywhere or else you would’ve found her!  Yeah, for about 30 minutes.  Yeah, we’re gonna go.  Yeah, it’s a very large plane.  But, we’ll stay here with you.  We have to leave for New York in an hour.  We can’t do that that’s insane. I mean ‘A’ he could wake up and ‘B’ y’know, let’s go for it.  ‘Kay!  Uhh, no.  No.  Yes.  Hey!  No we didn’t!  Yes! Good thing we have that, ‘Not in New York’ rule.  Right.  Oh. Y’know, that night meant a lot to me too, and it wasn’t because I was in a bad place or anything, it just meant a lot to me ‘cause, you’re really hot! Is that okay?  And I’m cute too.  Bye.  Hey!  Sure! Just give me a second to get all huffy and weird like you! Do you believe that who ever  No!  Our balcony? Seriously? That\\'s so funny because I told Monica we should put lights on our balcony. And she said  So are you gonna...talk to her?  You know when \"That\\'s fine\" sounds true when someone yells it and spits!  No no no. Good. So you\\'re moving on? Do you have any idea where you\\'re moving?  Dude, don\\'t rub my face in your crazy single life!  Why did I get married?!  Hey it\\'s the most eligible man in NY. How\\'s the moving on going?  Well maybe you\\'re going about this the wrong way. You know I mean think about it. Single white male, divorced three times,  What are doing? You know I can only dish it out!  Maybe she didn\\'t move on, you know...maybe that kiss was just an impulsive one-time birthday thing  Did she go out with him?  Ah! The high road...  Are you trying to get everybody divorced?  I thought I had to make the jokes!  Oh come on! Hello! Hi! My name is Chandler, here\\'s my friend Ross right here, and we were wondering you know if you\\'re up for it.  We still got it!  I don\\'t get it neither, I mean you\\'re obviously desperate, you\\'re asking women how they want to be killed  By drowning or...?!  Well...  Wow, it seems serious. What seems to be the problem, Ashley Judd?  I am sorry, moment to make fun of that, please!  It�s like a baby caterpillar chasing its mama!  Ok. First of all, this is green!  All right, I will help you out but you have to promise me you will not tell anyone what I am about to tell you.  Ok, you know how most kids get their allowance from mowing the lawn or taking out the garbage, well I earned mine  Yeah, well, I guess you don�t need my help Victor Victoria!  Oh, not with my combination of ice cubes, aloe Vera and my gentle self-loathing touch.  And done!  Thanks. You wanna see what it looks like?  Yeah, yeah, I think it looks pretty good. I was a little worried I was uncovering a birthmark right about  No problem.  Yeah.  I am sorry I am late. You�ll understand when you�ll see Joey.  Really? In front of all this people?  Oh my God!  Are those my wife�s nipples?  I gotta stop this.  You, touching yourself, out!  �Jeremiah was a bullfrog. Was a good friend of mine, never understood a single word he said, but I helped him  Y’know what? It seems like all of the sudden; so much has happened.  Phoebe is, making people.  And we just sit here. I mean if I die the only way people would even know I was here, would be by the ass print on this chair! Look, we have to do something. Okay? Something huge!  No-no, not something stupid, something huge.  Why not?! I mean it’s just, it’s just climbing! It’s just, it’s just steep!  We’re going to Everest! Okay, it would be nice to leave an ass print on Everest!  Yeah baby!  Yeah, we could do that without y’know risking our lives at all!  Yeeeeahhhh.  But I’ll tell you something. One of these days we’re get off of our buts and rent Die Hard again!  Uh-oh.  She was not good. Not good.  Uh-oh.  I didn’t know that.  See, maybe that’s the one we should’ve actually hidden.  This isn’t one of those uh, y’know \"If she doesn’t come, we-we don’t, we don’t come?\" Right? Because I already bought my ticket…  Oh, that\\'s Ross\\'s.  Come on, Ross? Remember back in college, when he fell in love with Carol and bought her that ridiculously expensive crystal duck?  I KNEW IT!!!!  Ahh, so how many cameras are actually on you?  Well, You could, but... probably just the one time.  If we do that, we gotta get Die Hard.  Oh! Look at that, time\\'s up! My turn!  It\\'s your timer.  All right, then massage me up right nice!  Ah! Ahh!! Ahh!!  It\\'s so good I don\\'t know what I\\'ve done to deserve it!  Good-bye muscles!!  I\\'m telling you, she gives the worst massages ever!! Okay, it was like she was torturing me for information. And I wanted to give it up I just—I didn\\'t know what it was!  Look, for the first time in my life I\\'m in a real relationship. Okay, I\\'m not gonna screw that up by y\\'know, telling the truth.  And you\\'re gonna make them all disappear.  Done.  Hey.  Hey!  Wow! You look just like your son Mrs. Tribbiani!  Pulling flowers out it makes the bag look a lot more masculine.  Oh my God!  And a date with a man!  I\\'m sorry but, ow-owww-owww!  Hey, is Rachel here?  Okay, but now see you\\'re crying!  What?  It\\'s okay, you don\\'t have to be the best at everything.  Okay, you give the worst massages in the world.  Okay, hear me out. Okay? You give the best bad massages. If anybody was looking for the best bad massage and they were thinking to themselves, \"Who\\'s the best of that?\" They\\'d have to go to you.  Oh, it would be you! You! Monica! And you\\'d get all the votes!  Absolutely!  Hey man, how did the audition go?  Oh my God!  Yeah umm, they\\'re called wallets.  Okay listen, just give me anything I can make two of.  Yeah! You wanna come?  Come on Chloe! Finish up with your customer first. Come on Chloe! Come on Chloe!!  Uh-oh.  Well ah, ........y\\'know.  Hey, y\\'know what, maybe we should get going. I mean what time did Chloe say we should be there?  What time is it now?  Yeah all right, so we’ll hang out.  Yes. Vividly.  Yeah. Yeah, I mean what, what would we do?  She was kidding.  She was.... But y\\'know what, just in case, maybe we should come up with a set of ground rules.  Right. Right. Well ah, y\\'know we could flip for it.  Well it you don’t know that, then I don’t want to do this with you.  And that’s the only colour that comes in.  So, what are you doing here? I thought tonight was your big anniversary dinner.  Hey, no way! Come on, this is you guys, call her and work it out.  Hey, this isn’t like swimming after you eat, pick up the phone!!  Y\\'know that whole swimming thing is a myth.  Why? What happened to him?  Actually, in Oklahoma smoking is legal in all commune areas and offices with fewer than fifteen people.  No! I just happened t�do a lot trivias about smoking in different states. For example, in Hawaii cigarettes are called Leyhallalookoos.  Uch, do you think, Monica is gonna be able smell it?  Pheebs?  No thanks, I�m good.  But, those are for you.  I messed up, it was a meeting, everybody was smoking.  �kay, look: Can we just drop this? I�m not gonna smoke again.  You forbid me?  You know, I flew a long way t see my loving wife? Is she here by the way?  Oh, would you say this was the most upset you could be?  Fine. What!?  Right, fine, I�ll do it, but no talking.  And no kissing your neck.  And lots of kissing your neck.  Look, I can�t do this. I can�t make luv to you while we�re fighting this way.  That was a celebration of life. Alright, look, I�m not gonna do this. Alright, is this really the way you want a baby to be conceived?  Mean it?  Yeah, let�s celebrate life!  Uhh. You are welcome.  What?  But you said you forgave me. It was just a couple of cigarettes�no big deal.  Leave it.  You tricked me to get me into bed?  I feel so used.  I would never lie to get someone into bed.  I suppose that Monica will have the � manipulative shrew.  You mean the lully story?  Oh yeah, that�s what she says. But maybe you�re not ovulating at all, maybe it�s just a clever ruse to get me into bed.  What�s the matter with me? Why I�m such a girl?  So you never had sex with a Kennedy, have you?  Ohh, she\\'s pretty. Pretty ahh, pretty girl, the pretty--she\\'s pretty.  I could die.  I tell people secrets. It makes them like me.  All right, I\\'m gonna do it! I\\'m gonna get shot down. Any advice?  Uh Kathy, with K or a C?  Oh-oh-hey!  Hey, come on, give me a break, I\\'m out on a limb here.  Yes-yes, I was just trying to figure out a way to uh, demonstrate how I could get my exceptionally large feet into my even bigger mouth.  Jeez, at 2:30 in the morning, I didn\\'t expect to have to fight over the remote.  Oh my God! That\\'s why I got up too!  Hey, listen, I\\'m sorry about this afternoon, y\\'know, if I would\\'ve known you guys were... I never would\\'ve...  So ah, Joey tells me you two met in acting class.  That\\'s a good thing actually, because ah, he used to have me rehearse with him.  Is it on?  Oh! It\\'s on! It\\'s on!  There we go little fella.  Well the duck can swim.  Oh yeah, me too, she\\'s so cool and pretty.  She\\'s smart and funny, y\\'know? We were up all last night talking, she said the funniest thing about--what?  No, I don\\'t.  Thank you, Ross.  All right.  All right.  Oh, I just wanted to say, \"Hey!\"  Really?!  Hey!  Ohh, umm, y\\'know what, I already ate.  Y\\'know I had a big meal on Monday, y\\'know. So that\\'s just gonna get me straight through the week.  You-you do?  You got me.  Yeah. Right.  Okay.  Ohh, she\\'s-she\\'s not really my type.  Y\\'know what I think it is? It\\'s the fishnet stockings. Y\\'know? Whenever I see a girl in fishnet stockings it reminds me of my father in fishnet stockings.  Uhh, no-no thanks.  What?  Hey, look, what do you want from me?  I am pretending.  Can I sleep on your couch?  Morning.  Yeah, like there\\'s any way I could ever do that.  Hey, you know what, here\\'s a thought. Why don\\'t you stay home from work today and just hang out with me.  I can not believe that I am going out with someone that is getting divorced. I\\'m such a grown up.  Well, maybe I won\\'t kiss you, and then you\\'ll have to stay.  Nope, not this time.  I\\'m not yanking you.  Yeah, I know. She makes me happy.  Hey!  Of!  You know, you should really go on this show. All right, listen, I got three tickets to the Rangers tonight. What\\'d ya\\' say?  No, Janice.  You know, I may be way out on a limb here, but do you, do you, have a problem with Janice?  Ooh, that girl that I hate, eww, drives me crazy, eww, eww, oh!  Well, there you go.  I want you to say that you like her!  Umm, yeah.  Girth? Why, why, why, wh-why, why, why, why would they do this?  We\\'re not gonna talk about girth are we?  Yeah, okay.  Yeah! All right! You go first.  Okay.  Princess Leia in the gold bikini.  I know!  Okay.  Okay, you know, you know when your in bed, with a woman.  And, ah, you know, your fooling around with her. And you get all these like, mental images in your brain, you know, like Elle MacPherson, or that girl at the Xerox place....  You said...  What are you guys doing together?  Really.  You still can\\'t stand her can you?  Well, you know, I appreciate you giving it a shot.  Well, I guess that\\'s something.  Okay.  Oh God!  Really?  Ok honey. that was close.  Hi honey I\\'m home!  oh it was great.  well, well, well it must be five in Tulsa because it\\'s six o clock IN NY.C!  no I\\'m not quite sure you got the right movie that\\'s all.  does what always have to be sharks.  What\\'s going on?  let ME be a part of this!  no they don\\'t  OH MY GOD! When you came in I switched the channel, I was just watching regular porn  yeah just some good old fashion girl on girl American action.  And you wonder why Ross is their favorite?  What are you doing?  It’s a dog.  It’s your parents’ anniversary and you’re going to talk about their dead pet?  Ha!  Yeah.  I don’t think the flash went off.  Somewhere there is someone with a tranquilizer gun and a huge butterfly net looking for that man.  What are you doin’?  I know, me too. Hey! Y\\'know what if we went away for a whole weekend? Y\\'know we\\'d have no interruptions and we could be naked the entire time.  Yeah, I can say that I have a conference and you can say you have a chef thing.  I\\'m not in charge of where the conference is held. Do you want people to think it\\'s a fake conference? It\\'s a real conference.  What\\'s going on?  Uh, hey!  We\\'re flipping Monica\\'s mattress.  Oh yes, somebody just said, \"Can you hear anything?\"  Condoms?  And condoms are the way to do that?  Oh, you should live with Joey, Roll-os everywhere.  Oh yes! Monica, get in here! There\\'s a high-speed car chase on!  Half a tank? We still got a lot of high-speed chasing to do!  What? Why?  Oh, I\\'m sorry, am I getting in the way of all the room switching fun?  Oh, who should I blame? The nice bell man who had to drag out luggage to 10 different rooms?  Do not speak ill of the dead.  I just want to watch a little television. What is the big deal? Geez, relax mom.  I said, \"Geez, relax Monnnnn.\"  Damn Rollos!  Hey.  Uh, no, I got to see Donald Trump waiting for an elevator.  Well, maybe it was the kind of food that tasted good at first but then made everybody vomit and have diarrhea.  Okay, fine, $300.  Yeah, just think of it as $25 per room!  Hi!  Okay, Ross is in the bathroom.  Kip, my old roommate, y\\'know we all used to hang out together.  Yes that was mine.  Yes that would have made more sense.  I just came over to drop off…nothing. So that weekend kinda sucked, huh?  So, I guess this is over.  Well, y\\'know, you and me, it had to end sometime.  Because of the weekend, we had a fight.  So, this isn\\'t over?  Really? Okay. Great!  Okay.  It happened in London.  The reason we didn\\'t tell anyone was because we didn\\'t want to make a big deal out of it.  No-no-no-no-no! You can\\'t!  Fun\\'s over!  You!  Oh, I can uh, check that for ya.  I can check that for ya.  Well… we-we do. You can only eat Tic Tacks in even numbers.  Okay, ten bucks says that we can name every item in that bag.  Yes!  Diet soda.  Orange juice.  Well, we used there’s up last night making scary faces.  All right! Ten buck! Fork it over! Cough it up! Pay the piper! Gimme it.  Fears and Pet Peeves.  His legs flail about as if independent of his body!  She has a real name.  Althea?! What are you doing?!  You\\'re shooting with Althea?!  Nice shooting!  Actually, it’s Miss Chinandolor Bong.  Unfortunately that is correct.  I majored in lightning rounds. All right, we’re gonna destroy you.  Well, I’m so confused as to what we’ve been doing so far…  Say 200?  But if we win, we get your apartment.  Dangerous Liaisons.  Fancy.  Fancy guest.  Thanks man.  You can’t just call Monica’s room.  Oh, I would never bet this apartment. It’s too nice.  Hey!  Yeah, but I bet it works.  Well believe it baby!  I knew it!  Cool, girl roommate.  Would you all stop yelling in our apartment! You are ruining moving day for us!  What?! What-what is it?!  I can’t believe we live here!  Hi, my name’s Chandler. I just moved in next door and I was wondering if you would be interested in battling me in a post-apoplectic world for control of the galaxies last remaining energy source?  So, is Janine around?  Can I check out what she did to my room?  No! Ok, this is not good. You are a guy. Ok? This is a guys place. If you let this go, you’re going to be sitting around with your fingers soaking in stuff.  Yes talk to her. Be a man.  Defend yourself.  Hey, how was your breakfast with Hillary?  Ohh, yeah.  That’s weird. I don’t think my boss likes me either.  Yeah let’s head off to work.  You know…Oh My God.  Yeah, what was wrong with your old…human teeth.  What???  I am proud of all my friends today.  Hi, I’m Chandler. Your live-in boy  Yes, God forbid we throw out old underwear. You-you know what? I’m going to go over to Joey’s.  Yes, but I feel like I’ve really gotten in touch with my feminine side enough today. You know. In fact I think we’re two sachets away from becoming a lesbian couple.  Nah, Nah, it’s okay. I feel like I need to be in guy place. You know, do kind of like a man thing.  You know when guys hang out they don’t just drink some beer and hammer up drywall?  No thanks, Josephine.  Hey Ross, I was wondering if… Oh my God!! Where are all the men???  Monica, could you excuse us for a second? I need to talk to the girl with the flowers.  What is the matter with you ?!?  You’re turning into a women.  Now I’ve upset you? What did I say?  Yeah.  Twenty percent is a pretty generous tip Joe.  I see where you’re goin’!  Hey-hey, is Monica here?  Okay, look I need your help, I don’t know what to get her for Valentine’s Day.  Yeah, I thought so to until I paper mached one of my eyes shut.  Nothing!  Well, have you guys made anything that maybe I can take credit for?  Hey! Honey, can I ask you a question about the Valentine’s Day gifts?  Do we have to make the entire thing?  Of course, of course not. I just have to uh, go over to the place where I-I made it and pick-pick it up.  Hey.  What?!  I can’t figure out what to make Monica.  I’m going crazy! Okay? Do you have any thing around here that looks homemade?  Yeah, I guess I could use that. I could say that your love sends me to the moon.  Wait a minute, I can’t give this to her.  Because it says \"Captain Ross\" on the side and \"I hate Monica\" on the bottom.  Hey! Hi! You uh, ready to exchange gifts?  Okay, come here! Come here.  Now, it’s not wrapped because I just, just finished it.  But I made you a tape of what I think are all romantic songs.  Okay!  Yeah!  It’s a sock bunny.  Not really.  I see. Y’know umm, Phoebe makes sock bunnies.  Oh, it’s okay. I don’t…  You are totally and completely 100% forgiven.  You have done enough!  No you don’t—get it in black, not brown.  Oop!  Well, it’s like that old saying, have some sex, eat some cake.  Who the hell is Carl?!  Y’know sometimes the good ideas are just right in front of you, aren’t they?  Oh my good God.  Look, you have done enough! Okay? You have to stop this now.  Oh, the mixed tape.  I am so, so, so, so sorry!  Come on Monica, it’s our Valentine’s Day. Please? Please-please, please?  So, are we going in there?  No, see, I\\'m trying this new screening thing. You know, I figure if I\\'m always answering the phone, people\\'ll think I don\\'t have a life. My god, Rodrigo never gets pinned.  What?  Bob here.  I\\'m back.  Um, absolutely. Uh, how \\'bout tomorrow afternoon? Do you know uh, Central Perk in the Village, say, five-ish?  Ok. Ok. Having a phone has finally paid off.  I\\'m hoping that when Bob doesn\\'t show up, she will seek comfort in the open arms of the wry stranger at the next table.  Ok, pure evil, horny and alone. I\\'ve done this.  Ok, while Ross is on the phone, everybody owes me 62 bucks for his birthday.  Hey, come on, we got the gift, the concert, and the cake.  Look guys, I know it\\'s a little steep.  But it\\'s Ross.  I\\'ll see you guys later, I gotta go...do a thing.  You know, I think I might just.  Oh, come on. I can never get a girl like that with conventional methods.  We don\\'t know Bob, ok? We know me. We like me. Please let me be happy.  All right.  Hi.  Listen, I have to, uh, um, I have to, I have to confess something.  Whoever stood you up is a jerk.  I don\\'t know. I just had this weird sense. You know, but that\\'s me. I\\'m weird and sensitive. Tissue?  No, you keep the pack. I\\'m all cried out today.  Oh, see, I had to tell her that my number was your number, because I couldn\\'t tell her that my number was my number because she thinks that my number is Bob\\'s number.  I will have the uh, Cajun catfish.  Yes, how \\'bout a verse of Killing Me Softly. You\\'re gonna sneeze on my fish, aren\\'t you?  Whoa, whoa, prom night flashback.  You can tell us.  We can talk about that.  So um, how come you guys haven\\'t talked about this before?  No, the thing was, we were gonna go see Hootie and the Blowfish.  Together.  So, the ebola virus. That\\'s gotta suck, huh?  Gee, Monica, what\\'s in the bag?  By the way, this didn\\'t seem so dorky in the hall.  Why, it\\'s six tickets to Hootie and the Blowfish! The Blowfish!  If you guys feel this big, maybe that\\'s not our fault. Maybe that\\'s just how you feel.  Why did you look at me when you said that?  Fine.  Yeah?  Yeah. Just let me grab my jacket and tell you I had sex today.  Wow, it sounds even cooler when somebody else says it. I was awesome, ok? She was biting her lip to stop from screaming.  Now I know it\\'s been awhile, but I took it as a good sign.  I had sex today. I never have to answer that phone again.  Bob here.  So, uh, you met someone, huh?  So, uh, how was he?  Eh?  Well, that makes me feel so good.  Well, maybe he had some kind of uh, new, cool style, that you\\'re not familiar with. And uh maybe you have to get used to it.  So, let\\'s go.  Yeah, I mean, it would be rude to them for us to leave now.  I can\\'t believe the guys missed this.  Chandler.  Yeah, we really missed you guys.  Yes, apparently Stevie and the band are like this.  I don\\'t know what to say. I\\'m sorry that we make more money than you. But we\\'re not gonna feel guilty about it. We work really hard for it.  I\\'m just saying that sometimes we like to do stuff that costs a little more.  Yes.  No.  Oh, I can\\'t believe my sperm have low motility because, let me tell you, when I was growing up they sure seem to be in a hurry to get places!!  Hi.  Oh, DAMN IT!  I think I can safely say that we all have family issues, work stuff and/or are sick.  But you come first!  Not as much fun as last time. Apparently you only get porn if you\\'re giving a sperm sample.  Well... there\\'s surrogacy, but Monica has dreamt her whole life of carrying a child, she has felt that watching a surrogate would be... too hard for her.  Yeah.  Aside from adoption the only other choice is insemination, so... we\\'re talking about sperm donors.  I wish there was an easier way for us to have a child but I don\\'t think there is one.  Hey! Look I brought a friend for dinner, this is Zack, from work!  So, how would you like to have a baby that\\'s half yours and half his!  Well, we\\'re talking about sperm donors and Zack may be the guy! I mean, look, he\\'s intelligent, he\\'s healthy, he\\'s athletic, I mean, he is \"spermtastic\"!  No, I invited him to dinner so you could get a chance to get to know him! I mean, if we go through a sperm bank you never meet the guy, get to check him out.  I\\'m telling you, he\\'s great! I mean, even if my sperm worked fine, I\\'d think he\\'d be the way to go!  Ok!  So what do you think? I want that guys genes for my kid! Those eyes, those cheeckbones!  You don\\'t like him.  Alright! Just follow my lead!  Oh! Thanks, I\\'m crazy about our place. Hey! speaking of crazy... do you have a history of mental illness in the family?  I noticed you were enjoying that Ravioli with a beautiful set of teeth. Did you have braces as a child?  You sure you don\\'t wanna stick around a little longer?  Are you just tired now or are you always tired, \\'cause that could be a sign of clinical depression.  Ok.  I think we\\'ve found our sperm!  Yeah, you think so, well? Should I ask him?  Why not, just because his great-grandmother was obese, our kids are gonna get that from you anyway!  Yeah, he\\'s better!  Really? Are you sure?  So you know this leaves us with...  How do you feel about that?  Me too. I wanna find a baby that needs a home and I wanna raise it with you. And I wanna mess it up in our own specific way.  We are gonna be great parents.  Wait, if we\\'re lucky, and we\\'re really really really quiet, we may be able to hear the sound of a condom breaking!  Hey, Zack!  Look, I just wanted to apologize for last night. I got the feeling we made you a little uncomfortable.  Really?  My wife and I have some boundary issues, you know, sometimes we ask inappropriate questions. We\\'re working on it.  You wouldn\\'t know if Jeanette\\'s planning on keeping her baby, would ya?  What’s the matter honey?  Oh, I got some thoughts on that.  What in God’s name is that?!  Why are you napping over here instead of over at your place?  Now, do I get to look at this book or is it just for people who are actually involved in the wedding?  Okay.  Centerpieces!  Uh-huh!  Oh yeah, I should probably call them.  Oh, I don’t think I ever heard that story.  What a sweet story.  Honey, it’s gonna be okay.  Look, it really is gonna be okay. The important thing is that we love each other and that we’re gonna get married.  Well, I have some.  Well, you’re not suggesting that we spend all of the money on the wedding?  Well, come on, I’ve been saving this money for six years and I kinda had some of it earmarked for the future, not just for a party.  No, I realize that honey, but I’m not gonna spend all of the money on one party.  Look, I understand, but I have to put my foot down. Okay? The answer is no.  Yes, I am!  Hey.  Ehh.  Look, I thought about it too, and I’m sorry. I think we should spend all of the money on the wedding.  Yeah, I’m putting my foot down. Yeah look, when I proposed I told you that I would do anything to make you happy, and if having the perfect wedding makes you happy then, then that’s what we’re gonna do.  Eh, forget about the future and stuff! So we only have two kids, y’know? We’ll pick our favorite and that one will get to go to college.  Yeah.  Uh, four, a boy, twin girls and another boy.  Well, stuff like where’d we live, y’know? Like a small place outside the city, where our kids could learn to ride their bikes and stuff. Y’know, we could have a cat that had a bell on it’s collar and we could hear it every time it ran through the little kitty door. Of course, we’d have an apartment over the garage where Joey could grow old.  Sure you do.  You sure?  I love you so much.  Oh yeah, totally!'},\n {'character': 'Monica',\n  'concatenated_lines': 'What’s the matter?  Oh, my mom called, they’re gonna run our engagement announcement in the local paper, so we’re looking for a good picture of us.  That’s not true, there are great pictures of us!  I know, but look at me all tan.  Chandler what do you say?  Chandler, listen to me sweetie, I know you can do this. Okay? You have a beautiful smile.  Or not.  That’s it! Take it! Take it! Take it!  Do you really want to pull at that thread?  Are you okay?  What?!  Chandler, what were you thinking?  Chandler?  Hey guys check it out! My mom sent me the paper!  Yeah, we really do!  Wow! Imagine what our kids would look like!  Do you really want a job with Popular Mechanics?  Hey, guys.  Lots of responses.  Oh, please, that is such a lame excuse!  I mean, that\\'s a typical guy response.  So I wouldn\\'t need any, right? Cause I have a straight.  Alright, here we go. We\\'ve got salmon roulettes and assorted crudites.  Alright, you know, we got it, we got it. Let\\'s play for real. High stakes... big bucks...  Hell no, we\\'ll pay!  And you know what? We want a rematch.  Yeah, I know. He can get really competitive.  What?  Please! I am not as bad as Ross.  That was not an incident! I-I was gesturing, a-and the plate slipped out of my hand.  You\\'re kidding! Where? Where?  Oh, Rachel!  Well, what\\'s the job?  I don\\'t think so.  What?  Really?  Uh, Aunt Iris? This is Phoebe, and that\\'s Rachel...  OK, great. You\\'ll tell us and we\\'ll laugh. Let\\'s play poker.  Ha, ha, very funny, very funny. But I think we\\'d like to give poker another try. Shall we, ladies?  You know what? This is not over. We will play you again, and we will win, and you will lose, and you will beg, and we will laugh, and we will take every last dime you have, and you will hate yourselves forever.  OK, we done with the chit-chat? Are we ready to play some serious poker?  Excuse me, where are you going?  Do you want to go to the bathroom, or do you wanna play poker?  Me too.  Sorry, Rach.  Alright, check.  Rachel, there\\'s nothing in it.  OK, here you go. Good luck.  That, you get? That, you get?  It\\'s a stupid game and I wasn\\'t playing against other people, so technically I didn\\'t lose.  \\'Cause you invited your assistant.  Oh! Why didn\\'t you tell me? I made him his own individual sweet potato stuffed pumpkin.  All right, I\\'m out of oven space. I\\'m gonna turn on Joey\\'s. Please, watch him! Do not let Joey eat any of the food!  Ross, I\\'m gonna use yours, okay?  Ross’s apartment is nice! How come we don\\'t hang out here more often?  That\\'s my pie!  Uh-oh! Uh-oh!  Phoebe, why is there a dog in our apartment?  Phoebe, there\\'s a dog sitting on my couch!  I\\'ll be right there!  Oooh, I wish she could stay here, but Chandler is allergic!  Chandler, if that dog\\'s been here that long, and you haven\\'t had a reaction, maybe you\\'re not allergic to this dog?  Don\\'t do what?  1250.  Yeah.  Really? I\\'d say 3 to 4.  When it\\'s your assistant, I would say never.  Please, don\\'t listen to Joey, okay. Would you look at him? He-he’s obviously depressed. He\\'s away from his family; he\\'s spending Thanksgiving with strangers.   What he needs right now is for you to be his friend.  Okay Phoebe, we should probably go back now.  Stop it. Stop! Okay let\\'s go. We can be strong.  That\\'s not gonna work.  Hey! I didn\\'t know either.  Yeah, I knew.  Relax, Ross. She\\'s not made of ice cream!  Hi, honey.  What? Why, why would...  That\\'s right, she came back all by herself.  Do you realize that four weeks from today we’re getting married? Four weeks baby!! Four weeks!!!  There’s still so much to do. Have you written your vows yet?  Sweetie, you know I have no sense of humor when it comes to the wedding.  No! But I know exactly what I’m going to say.  Thank you.  Ennnh.  Ooh, are we allowed to lie in the vows?!  It’s kind of an important one!  No fair. I don\\'t even have one. How come they get two?  Oh yeah? When?  Why won\\'t I be married when I\\'m 40?  Ok, hypothetically, why won\\'t I be married when I\\'m 40?  What is it? Is there something fundamentally unmarriable about me?  Well?  What?  You said you loved me! I can\\'t believe this!  Yes, you did!  You love me!  Then all your stuff would be here.  Then you’d be going back and forth all the time, I mean it doesn’t make any sense.  You wanted it to be a surprise.  Yes.  Chicken? I could eat some chicken.  Yes, but you cannot tell anyone! No one knows!  Please? Please?! We just don\\'t want to deal with telling everyone, okay? Just promise you won\\'t tell.  Bye!  Actually, I did!  Ohhh, oh my God! Oh my God! She knows about us!  Them?! Who\\'s them?  Joey!  Oh man, they think they are so slick messing with us! But see they don\\'t know that we know that they know! So…  She\\'s bluffing!  You go back out there and you seduce her till she cracks!  Of course.  Well actually, Ross doesn\\'t.  Let\\'s see, 1939... yeah, 24, 25?  Hey, you guys!  Oh that’s so sweet.  Yeah, I don’t hear Chandler’s and he doesn’t hear mine.  Chandler!!  Ok, um, I\\'ll go with you.  It\\'s gonna be a problem, isn\\'t it?  But I\\'m...  Yeah, uh, it\\'s actually not that big a deal.  You\\'re welcome.  Phoebe, listen. You were with me, and we were shopping all day.  We were shopping, and we had lunch.  You had a salad.  Yes. Uh, yes, I did. That was my friend, Eddie Moskowitz. Yeah, he likes it. Reaffirms his faith.  Hey, where is everybody?  Just out. Had some lunch, just me, little quality time with me. Thanks for your jacket.  Okay.  You know what probably happened? Someone musta stolen my credit card.  That is an excellent excellent question. That is excellent.  Judy.  Julie.  Jody!  Look, when it started I was just trying to be nice to her because she was my brother\\'s girlfriend. And then, one thing led to another and, before I knew it, we were...shopping.  Honey, wait. We only did it once. It didn\\'t mean anything to me.  Really, Rachel, I was thinking of you the whole time. Look, I\\'m sorry, all right. I never meant for you to find out!  That is not true!  Did it ever occur to you that I might just be that stupid?  I don\\'t know what else to say.  I feel terrible, I really do.  It\\'s that terrible?  Look, I know that you\\'re in a place right now where you really need to hate Julie\\'s guts, but she didn\\'t do anything wrong. I mean, she was just a girl who met a guy, and now they go out. I really think that if you gave her a chance, you\\'d like her. Would you just give that a chance, for me?  You guys, Joey just saw Janice kissing her ex-husband.  So, do you want me to watch Ben for you?  He’s not gonna say anything, because we’re not gonna tell him.  No we’re not.  Okay.  Oh my God! Well push it in! Push it in!  Okay, we’re gonna need a distraction.  I got it!  A hat! Yes! We need a hat.  Where are we gonna find a tiny little hat?  Give it. Give it.  It just makes more sense as an ensemble.  Besides, it takes the focus off the hat.  Sure, we have no money, go ahead.  Oh my God! He just said my name! Did you hear that?  Did he just say ‘Monica bang’?  Oh my God! He’s gonna rat me out!  You okay?  Okay, Ben, I won’t tell your daddy that you had ice cream for dinner, if you don’t tell about our little bonking incident.  Oh that’s right, that’s what I’d sound like if I exploded.  All right, we should call somebody.  How are we gonna do that? There’s no way.  Yeah.  No. Why?  Really?!  And yet, we’re still poking him.  Hey guys!  We need to talk to you about something.  No, it\\'s not!  Thank you, Pheebs!  What? You are way off, lady!  That\\'s my favourite kind! Okay, we are doing this!  Hey, stay out of this, Chandler! This is between me... and ME!  You guys, I ordered some chocolate pies from that bakery on Bleecker. Could you pick them up for me?  No, no, no, I don\\'t make chocolate pies. When I was younger I-I enter in this pie-eating contest. I ate so many that just the thought of them made me sick.  2 minutes, 12 pies and a part of one tin! Okay, I see you guys at 4.  This dinner is gonna be so great! In your face, last year \"me\"!  You don\\'t know that.  Yeah, but we haven\\'t heard a thing from the adoption agency and it has been weeks!  Name one of his books.  Ok, let\\'s see... uhm, okay, the turkey is in the oven, the stuffing is ready...  Oh, Chandler, that\\'s sweet. But you don\\'t have to do everything Doctor Phil tells you to do.  Ok, let\\'s see... Oh, the cranberry sauce, it is easy to make and no-one really cares about it.  Where is everybody? They\\'re forty-five minutes late!  Ohhh! Let me see! Oh God, I can\\'t believe this! They\\'re an hour late and they\\'re just staying out there, talking!  Oh! They\\'re late and they\\'re sloppy!  No! Everything\\'s cold. The turkey\\'s dried out and the... the stuffing is all soggy.  That\\'s all the turkey you\\'re gonna get.  Hey, you touch that and you will be sorry.  Stinky?!  Oh! Enough! A monkey could have made \\'em!  Yeah, they do seem to feel pretty bad.  Yeah, I asked you and Phoebe to pick up the pies. You did remember, right?  Grand Supreme Little Darling?  Oh my God! YOU FORGOT THE PIES? Well, I cannot believe this. You force me to make dinner, then you\\'re an hour late and you forget the one little thing that I asked you to do.  It\\'s too late for apologies.  The three of us?  Joey, that is not gonna work.  Bring it.  Here you go!  Okay, try it.  Alright, we\\'re gonna have to unscrew the chain.  Chandler, where are your tools?  I do, but Rachel borrowed them.  Oh!  Okay, I have to get that. Now when I get back, I want you and your friends to be gone. Thanksgiving is over. The Vein has spoken.  That was the adoption agency...  WE\\'RE GETTING A BABY!  There\\'s a pregnant woman in Ohio, and she picked us!  This Thanksgiving kicks last Thanksgiving\\'s ass!  Okay, look, this could be a really long game.  Ross, that’s my jacket.  Ross, your little creature’s got the remote again.  Great.  Ah no, you see, someone was supposed to take them down around New Year’s... but obviously someone forgot.  I can’t believe you. You still haven’t told that girl she doesn’t have a job yet?  Congratulations, I think you’ve found the world’s thinnest argument.  I’ll get it.  Oh. Hi, Mr.Heckles.  We’re not doing anything. We’re just sitting around talking, quietly.  Okay, I think I get how to do this.  Are you alright?  Hon, you gotta talk to Joey.  Rachel, what are you doing? It’s freezing out here. Would you come back inside?  Oh, some idiot customer put a suggestion in the suggestion box.  That was you?!  Wow! You’re a lot sturdier that Chandler. He crumpled like a piece of paper. So how was you’re trip?  So what did you do today Pete?  Can you believe he just offered me a restaurant?  Hmm, no. I mean how can I accept a restaurant from him? I-I-I-I can’t. I couldn’t even accept a necklace from Stu Vincent in the seventh grade.  Oh, please.  What? Honey.  Oh God, I’m so sorry.  Oh God!  What-what was it you were gonna tell us?  Okay. Here’s the thing.  I can’t do it. I’m sorry, I wish I could, but umm, see you have these feelings for me....  Huh?  Oh?  Oh, that’s great! I mean I’m-I’m sorry, but I’m so happy for you. And now I can work for you!  Hey!  Hey, guess what I’m doing tonight.  I’m checking out the restaurant with Pete.  I know.  What?  Okay, but wouldn’t it be easier if you had to tell me something that you could tell me.  Okay. Does it have to do with Ross and Rachel?  Does it have to do with Joey?  Does it have to do with-with Chandler and that sock that he keeps by his bed?  Does it involve travel?  Does it involve clogs?  Clogs.  Claws?!  Okay, so it doesn’t involve Ross or Rachel or Chandler or Joey. But, what about Pete?  What is it?! What about Pete?  Okay, I feel like I’m talking to Lassie. All right, Phoebe would you just tell me!  Okay, does it involve something to do with Pete’s computer company?  I don’t believe this! Wow, look at this refrigerator! It’s gigantic! I mean I could live in this thing! I’d be cold, but I’m always cold. Oh my God, look at these spider burners! I love spider burners.  Did you just smell my hair?  Oh God.  You still have feelings for me don’t you?  Pete.  No, it’s not bad. It’s not bad at all. It’s-it’s really nice.  You may be okay about getting hurt, but I am not okay with being the one who hurts you. That’s why I can’t take this job.  And well, we probably shouldn’t see each other anymore. I’m sorry.  Okay, bye.  What?  Hi.  Hey-hey-hey. You wanna hear something that sucks.  Chris says they’re closing down the bar.  Yeah, apparently they’re turning it into some kinda coffee place.  Got me.  Hey, did you pick a roommate?  Is it the Italian guy?  He’s so cute.  Oh look, the pool table’s free. Rack ‘em up. I’ll be back in just a minute. Get ready for me to whip your butt.  Oh my God, you can’t even see where the Titanic hit it.  Awww, just like you always wanted. Congratulations  Aww, not right now.  I know.  So, I’ll get-get back to my friend.  Oh, that’d be great.  Thanks.  What are you doing with the lamp?  Oh, well don’t take it to the same place you took the stereo, ‘cause they’ve had that thing for over a week.  Hi, again.  Thank you soo, much.  You want some help with that?  Whoa! Are you okay?  Do you wanna come in for some lemonade?  Thank you. Just make yourself comfortable.  Oh my God!!! What are you doing?!!  So?!  Yeah huh!! Cover yourself up!  I don’t believe this! When someone asks you in for lemonade, and to you that means they wanna have sex?  It’s okay. I suppose it could happen to anyone, not anyone I know, but... By the way I can still see it.  Pheebs?  Where’s your bed?  What?  What are you talking about?  Everybody knows!  Well, you-you coulda just turned the cushion over.  What?!?!  You can spill. In the sink.  I love you, too.  What? I’m just said.  Hey.  Phoebe moved out.  I don’t understand, I mean am I so hard to live, is this why I don’t have a boyfriend?  Well, I think so.  I know, it is isn’t it?  Yeah! And I got it on sale, too.  Well, if you wanna get a drink later we can.  Hey, are you okay?  Really?!  Sweety, what are you talking about?  Oh.  Ennnh.  Jellyfish sting! Oh, it hurts! It hurts!! It hurts!!  It’s like two miles!  Oh damn the jellyfish. Damn all the jellyfish!  What?! What is it?!  What?!! Gross!!  Nothing, I don’t know.  Nothing. I’m gonna take a shower.  Pass the cheese, please.  My God, you can’t even look at me! Can you?  What? We took a walk, nothing happened. I can back with nothing all over me.  I was in too much pain.  You bet.  Hey!!  Will you stop!  Okay, all right, I think you’re great, I think you’re sweet, and you’re smart, and I love you. But you will always be the guy who peed on me.  Um, well, I was going to, I-I-I really was. But um, then somewhere, just out of nowhere, I didn’t.  Well, um, because mainly, um, they don’t like you. I’m sorry.  Maybe because you used to be aloof, or that you’re really sarcastic, or that, y’know, you joke around all the time. Or that you take off your clothes and throw them on the couch.  Look, I know that I should’ve told them. I know I shouldn’t care what they think. I’m sorry.  You really think that’ll work?  Nothing.  No, sweetie, I-I trust you.  You’re not gonna mess it up.  Well, it’s done about two minutes before it looks like that.  Whoa whoa whoa! Where’re you goin’?  Oh, Janine, the really hot dancer girl?  You’re not gonna go anywhere, you said you were gonna eat here, and you’re gonna eat here!  Dad, Chandler was just laughing at your joke.  Y’know dad, Chandler is one of Ross’s very best friends!  Mom, uh, Chandler was just saying how beautiful your sweater is.  Ross, I can’t believe you’d do that!  You! It’s not like it’s a big deal! You-you don’t still do it or anything!  Dad, please don’t pick your teeth out here! Alright, and if you’re gonna put your feet up, why don’t you sit on the-  Ross, if you don’t tell them, then I will!  Really?  Okay.  It’s so good, that I feel really selfish about being the only one who’s eating it, that I think we should have everyone taste how good it is. Especially Ross.  Ross? Let’s go.  Alright, you know what? That’s it. You’ve had your chance.  And Dad, y’know that mailman that you got fired? He didn’t steal your Playboys! Ross did!  Ross hasn’t worked at the museum for a year!  Ross married Rachel in Vegas! And got divorced! Again!!!!  Well actually, I-I didn’t eat mine. It’s still in the bathroom.  Oh no, wait! Joey!  Happy New Year.  She has a better chance of sprouting wings and flying up your nose than you do of not making fun of us.  Hey Rach, maybe your resolution should be to umm, gossip less.  Well if Ted Kopel talked about his coworkers botched boob jobs, I would.  Hi Ben!  I like \\'em.  I like them a lot.  It\\'s my New Year\\'s resolution!  No! To take more pictures of all of us together. I mean I really think it\\'s the best resolution because everyone will enjoy the pictures.  We heard about your pants, I\\'m so sorry.  See? Ben doesn\\'t think you\\'re a loser, he thinks you\\'re a cowboy! Now that\\'s something.  Okay, now that everything\\'s wrapped up here, I think I\\'m, I\\'m gonna go do my laundry.  Hey how was dinner?!  Okay!  Okay!  Uh Tim? This is Phoebe. Phoebe this is Tim, my new sous chef.  Hey Tim? I need a calamari and a Caesar salad. And umm, could you get me the pesto?  All right, I still need a calamari and a Caesar salad.  Hi!  I…I have to fire him.  Because he’s terrible! Okay, he’s slow, he burns things, last night he lit my pastry chef on fire!  Well, now she has no eyebrows, mission accomplished.  I paid to have this done.  Hey. Okay, I gave him another chance, but Tim has got to go!  No! No-no! He is totally incompetent. I called the chef who recommended him to me. He said, \"Ha-ha! Gotcha!\"  Why not?!  What?! You said he was sweet!  Just don’t pick up your phone.  What? So now I’m not allowed to fire him?  Okay well then, I’ll fire him today and you go out with him for another week.  Okay well, then we’ll both do it today and he’ll just have to deal with it!  What do you mean?  I wanted to do this days ago so I think I should go first.  Hey.  Uh well that depends, how are things with Phoebe?  You’re fired.  Yeah and-and I’m sorry too. But, well I just—I like things done a certain way and the chemistry’s just not right.  Tim wait!  Umm, I think I spoke too quickly. There-there’s a learning curve with this job and maybe we can try it again.  Yeah.  Okay.  And it’s a magnet!  Ohh! Yeah, I forgot.  Wow! Uh what, did he uh, say?  Hey!  Phoebe that’s crazy!  No-no, I-I just, I liked them so much that I went out and bought some for myself.  I loved them!  Hey!  How’d the lecture go?  That you’re not funny or sexy?  Yeah, but y’know we could sneak in and watch.  What the hell are you doing?!  Gimme ‘em!  You stole them from me!  Gimme them!  You just wanna each take one?  Why don’t you phase it out? Yeah, fade the accent out and people will think you’re, y’know, that you’re adjusting to life in America.  I think you look fine.  Okay, come on, do it one more time!  Yes!  Six? I just had it for one night. It’s three.  Y\\'know in a weird way, you have too much power. Look, you’re gonna have to help me out here, ‘cause I only have three.  Right.  What?  It’s good to see you too.  You see that guy? He’s in classics now, but y\\'know as soon as we leave he’s going straight to the porn.  Yeah.  Me too.  Oh, um, I don’t know if that’s a good idea.  No, I just I think that it’s too soon.  Yeah well, I ran into Richard.  Oh, um, around 8:02. We ah, talked for a little while, and then um, we went out for an innocent burger.  Tomorrow night.  It’s not a date, okay. I’m just gonna teach him how to make lasagne for some pot luck dinner he has.  We’re not gonna have sex! Okay, nothing’s changed here. He still doesn’t want children and I still do, so that’s why we’re just gonna be friends.  You say ‘Thank you very much,’ and then you buy me something pretty. Come on, we’re gonna put are hands in this bowl, and we’re gonna start squishing the tomatoes.  You touch people’s eyeballs every day and this feels weird.  Oops.  Gotta keep squishing.  Okay.  Oh, gosh, you got some on your shirt.  Umm, you’ve got some on your pants.  So we can be friends who sleep together.  Sounds smart and healthy to me. So um, just out of curiosity, um, do you currently have any other racquetball buddies?  Oh.  ‘Cause if you do that means you’d be cancelling it for me, and we’re just friends.  Hi.  What are you smiling at?  Yeah, right.  I love this friend thing!  Ow!  Why not?! I mean this has been the most amazing week. Would it be so terrible? Even if we were friends who lived together. Or, maybe someday friends who stood up in front of their other friends, and vowed to be friends forever.  That’s not true, you don’t have a moustache.  Y\\'know what, I’ve got to walk out of here right now, ‘cause getting over you is the hardest thing that I have ever had to do. I don’t think I could do it again.  How ‘bout one last game of racquetball?  Watch the thorns!  Well, we-we had to go back because I forget my jacket.  Oh man! I did it again!  What?  That\\'s what it sounded like.  Umm, why don\\'t you give me something that would be a good reason and-and then I\\'ll tell you if it\\'s true.  Harder than it sounds. Isn\\'t it?  Umm, listen there\\'s something I think you should know.  Umm, actually I was about to tell you that I was, I was going to get out of it, but hey, if we\\'re just goofing around then uh, maybe I will go out with him.  Feeling a little better sweetie?  Me too.  Hello Dan! I\\'m really looking forward to Saturday night! Really, really!  Chandler!  So, why wait \\'til Saturday, are you free tomorrow?  Oh, great!  Bye Dan!  Great!  Well uh, you and I are just goofing around, I thought, why not goof around with him.  I think you\\'re better than you think you are.  I think you\\'re my favorite.  I don\\'t care.  Phoebe, we are so proud of you! You\\'re amazing!  Chandler, that’s like your fourth cup of coffee!  He’s in a different room! He’s really that loud?  Y’know I used to go out with this guy that was a really light sleeper, and whenever I started to snore, he would just roll me over…  He would just roll me over and I would stop snoring.  Have you guys picked a date yet?  Ugh, she’s upstairs not doing the dishes! And I tell ya something! I’m not doing them this time! I don’t care if those dishes sit in the sink until they’re all covered with—I’ll do them when I get home!  I’ll pick it up for you!  Okay.  Oh my God! Ohh! Look at this one! It’s so beautiful!  Oh, yes, umm, I’m here to pick up a dress that you have on hold.  Emily Waltham.  I am, aren’t I?  Yes?  Phoebe?  Can you just hold on for one minute?  Are you alone?  All right.  Okay, ready?  Okay.  Congratulations!  Okay! My turn! My turn!  This isn’t even my dress.  I’m changing out of this.  In like a half-hour?  Okay, throw it straight this time.  I’m getting married next!!  Yeah. I mean it was kinda fun for a while, but didn’t you start feeling silly?  Oh God.  Hey!  So, is Joey gonna stop snoring?  No, seriously.  Oh my God!  Well, are you asleep right now, Joe? ‘Cause I don’t think you have to wear it unless you are!  Again. Y’know what? I think we all did.  Oh God! He’s gonna come by and borrow some candles for his big date!  No-no, Rachel, don’t get it! He can’t see us!  Hey!  Oh, So you can move them!  It\\'s nice to meet you. Janine...?  Joey, did you even interview this woman before you asked her to move in?  Uh-huh, what exactly did you ask her?  Oh, so you like her too Chandler?  Wait a minute...Joey. Joey you can\\'t ask her out, she\\'s your roommate. It-it\\'ll be way too complicated.  Yeah and you better watch the flirting too, cause you know, in such close quarters, it could be trouble.  Did you also have his album, It\\'s Not Easy Being Green?  So, Phoebe runs weird huh?  Why don\\'t you just be straight with her? Tell her the truth.  I don\\'t know. Rachel I\\'m-I\\'m sorry that I hurt your ankles.  We\\'ll see.  Terrible. If-if I want something done right, I have to do it myself. Other people just wreck stuff. I really think I might kill someone tonight.  It\\'s worse. The only thing that\\'s getting me through is knowing that I\\'m gonna be seeing you soon. I think I may even try to get out of here early.   Well, are you just hanging out with Ross?  What?!  Why is Ross naked?  Naked?  Is it the same thing that Chandler had?  Okay, listen, there\\'s still some of Chandler\\'s medicine under the sink in the bathroom. Bye!  Is it okay for me to come in now?  Why is everything different?  Well, the end table is wrong, The couch looks bizarre and don\\'t even get me started on the refrigerator magnets.  It\\'s okay. Chandler, are you afraid of me or something?  Of course not. I mean gosh, Chandler what you did, it\\'s, it\\'s a wonderful thing and I really appreciate it. I know I have this weird thing where I want everything to be in the perfect place, but I\\'d never expect you to worry about that.  Of course!  So, did I hear Poconos?  Yeah, that\\'s a big step.  And Monica knows...  Carol called me to thank me for the lasagna, I asked, she told me.  I\\'m sorry, I\\'m just excited about being an aunt!  Phoebe, what\\'s the matter?  Phoebe, what is it?  Well, what happened?  Are you sure?  Was it...?  Oh!  So how does this work, you going to balance the plates on these little guys\\' heads?  Oh, you\\'re right.  Ooh...hey honey, are you all right?  Yes! And that would be a shut-down!  Where are you guys going? Come on, one more game!  Of course! Joey wouldn’t let you have one?  Hey, have you figured out a way to tell him you’re moving out?  Y’know, I really have to tell Rachel, but I… We just have to get it over with! Y’know, the next time we see them we’re just gonna tell them. Okay? That’s it.  Pretty much.  Hi!  Joey, we have something to tell you.  Wait! Joey! Joey! Are you okay?!  Hey Pheebs!  Hey, have you seen Rachel?  I have some pretty exciting news!  No! Chandler and I are moving in together!  Hey!  Well umm, Chandler and I are moving in together.  Ugh, I thought you were Rachel!  I just tell her, I have to get it over with. I told Ross and Phoebe and she’s the only one left!  No.  Really?!  Yeah, he’s gonna work on that.  Soon! I-I just couldn’t before. You saw how upset Joey got! I couldn’t do that to her, she’s my best friend!  I’m not your best friend?  All right, all right, at least I’m prepared.  These aren’t for you! Are you upset?  Rach, there’s something uh, important I have to tell you.  No! But, I’m throwing this shirt away! I think there was a little misunderstanding before.  Umm, when I said that uh, that Chandler and I wanted to umm, live together we meant alone together.  Oh no sweetie, no! This is my fault, I wasn’t clear! I’m really sorry. And listen, you take as much time as you need to move out okay? There’s absolutely no rush.  Okay. Don’t you want a cookie?  Maybe, do you need a tissue?  I made them!  So I, I told Rachel it was just gonna be the two of us.  I mean, all I’m asking for is just a little emotion! Is that too much to ask after six years?! I mean what? Are-are-are Rachel and I not as close as you guys?! I mean do we not have as much fun?! Don’t I deserve a few tears?!! I mean we-we told Joey, he cried his eyes out!  Hey. So um, I was thinking that maybe we should start dividing up our stuff.  Y’know, no point in dragging it out. Dragging out the long process of you moving out and us not living together anymore.  Something to remember me by!  But still, it’s a big change. The end of an era, you might say!  I’m fine! I just, I’m thinking how much it’s an end of era.  An era is defined as a significant period of time. Now, it was significant to me, maybe it wasn’t significant to you!  What is the matter with you?!! Why aren’t you more upset?! Aren’t you gonna be sad that we’re not gonna be living together anymore?! I mean aren’t you gonna miss me at all?!  What’s hard to believe?  Rachel, it’s going to happen. Chandler is gonna move in here.  No-no, wait! Just let me finish, okay? This isn’t something that we just, we just impulsively decided in-in Vegas, this is something we both really want. And it is going to happen.  Yeah, sweetie.  No.  I know!  That place in Vermont? You can take a hint!  Well, can\\'t you just have the party when we get back?  Well, I\\'m sorry, but Chandler and I could really use a weekend away. You know, to reconnect... emotionally.  All right, we\\'ll stay. We can just drive up after the party.  Believe me, that is not why we won\\'t be doing that!  Hey!  All right... you\\'re right. We\\'re sorry. Now let\\'s wake up Emma and get the fun time started!  Are you freaking kidding me, Green?  So glad you came!  I can\\'t believe Emma is still asleep!  I\\'ve got a plan. I\\'ve got a plan. I\\'m going to ram this platter really hard into your ribs. You\\'re gonna scream out and that\\'ll wake her up!  Oh my God, that place has the creamiest frosting! I use to hitchhike there when I was a kid.  Oh, did you do a picture of Emma?  Oh. So nice of her to pull my hair, \\'till I dropped the key!  We\\'re Aunt Monica and uncle Chandler, by the way. You may not recognize us, because we haven\\'t spoken to your parents in seventeen years!  Ross, Rachel promised it would be over by now. We seriously have to go, if we want to get to Vermont. I called them and the last train leaves in a half hour.  Alright, 5 more minutes.  No, he didn\\'t! He pretended to be a Quaker to get out of Korea.  Yeah, and we\\'ve paid for a room, that we\\'re supposed to be in right now!  No! no! Let\\'s figure out a fair way to decide who\\'s staying.  Ok, how about this: We got wind up toys for Emma for her birthday. We can make them race, and whoever comes in last, stays!  Wha... How the hell is that gonna help?  Now another way to organise your stuffed animals, is by size.  Game?  That\\'s how old you are.  ...and head to Canada!  I wasn\\'t. Let\\'s get going!  What about your massage client?  Thanks!  Hey.  How’s the big anniversary dinner?  Ohhh, nice.  Oh no!!  Rachel, you and Mark?!  Hey.  Oh, there’s banana on it.  Oh, good. Thanks.  Okay, all right don’t judge me to much. Okay? Um, but I saw this info-mercial, and um, I swear to you I have never-ever bought anything on TV before, except for this mop. But there was this stuff on leg waxing, it just, it looked so amazing....  Yes! Have you seen it?  I know!!  Hello! Organic substances recently discovered in the depths of the rain forest!  Did that!  No. It was painful. Oh my God , they should call it Pain-zine, now with a little wax.  That’s because their nerves are probably deadened from being so stupid. But hey, y\\'know if you don’t believe me, please, by my guest.  Now, are you glad we didn’t start with the bikini strips?  Ow!  Ow!! Ow!!  It’s okay, it’s okay.  We were just waxing our legs.  That’s right.  What?  Oh my God.  Because they’ll know we’ve been listening.  What if they don’t?  Hey. It’s three in the morning. They don’t know that I’ve come home yet. You notice how neither one of them are wondering where I am.  And the fact that they\\'re both monkeys.  This wasn\\'t addressed to Days of Our Lives, this is, this came to your apartment. There\\'s no stamp on it, this woman was in our building.  I can\\'t believe Joey\\'s having lunch with his stalker. What i-, what is she like.  Ah, and I mean, he\\'s going out with her? He can not persue this.  Excellent!  Rachel, it\\'s a world where Joey is a neuro-surgeon.  Ross, there he is.  Oh my God, oh my God, oh my God.  Jean-Claude Van Damme. I didn\\'t know he was in this movie, he is so hot.  The muscles from Brussels, wham bam Van Damme, did you see Time Cop?  Rachel, he like, totally changed time.  Oh, yeah.  He could hear me.  Oh Rachel don\\'t, don\\'t you dare, don\\'t, don\\'t. Tell him I cook.  So what\\'d he say?  Well, thanks anyway.  Rachel if you, if you want to go out with him, you can. Sound like a big jerk to me but if that\\'s what you want to do...  Oh, I\\'ll have an espresso. Oh acutally, I\\'ll get it. If I ask you to, you\\'ll probably end up drinking it yourself.  What did you say?  Ya know, you had no right to go out with him.  You sold me out.  Yes you did. Absolutely.  Did you just flick me?  You flicked me first.  Uh-huh.  OK.  Yes.  Fine,  This is so wild. Ya know, I gotta admit, I was kinda surprised that you agreed to go on a blind date.  Well, what made you make the exception for me?  Say you\\'re sorry.  Say it.  Rachel, you say you\\'re sorry or your sweater gets it.  Say you\\'re sorry.  What\\'re you gonna do?  You don\\'t have the guts.  I\\'ll help you fix your sweater.  I\\'m sorry that I made you stop seeing him.  OK.  But no. Maybe if I were baking.  Hey!  Yep! You got the tickets?  Okay, if you need the vacuum, it’s in my closet on the left-hand side. Ah, the garbage bags are next to the refrigerator…  Yeah, okay, give that a try!  All right, y’know what? We really are late! Let’s go! Let’s go! Let’s go!!  Chicken Kiev?  It’s nice.  They torn it down a few days early.  Oh my God!  Hey!  Umm…  She said that?!  Why?!  Oh my God. You’re even dumber than I am!  Ross, how long have you been planning this wedding?  Sometimes we were.  Okay.  You’ll see.  Ohh. And I don’t even have a date.  Hey.  Ha ha, a joke that’s funny in all countries.  Well I didn’t want everyone to think I was stupid.  Well, thanks, we like him.  Then why would he say it?  Oh, my mother’s right. I’m never going to get married.  Ohh, Please?! I’m a single mom, with a thirty year old son!!  Yep, yep...You?  Well...I’d better get going.  Well, I love it. I only hope my wedding looks this good.  Stupid.  What were we thinking?  Oh yeah. Definitely.  Hey!  You got out of the whole Tulsa thing?  It\\'s great! How?  No. I can\\'t be away from you for that long.  Yeah, you\\'re my husband. I\\'m not gonna live in a different state than you for 208 days out of the year.  Honey, thanks for trying to figure out a way, but if you\\'re going to Tulsa, I wanna go with you.  Excuse me?  Why don\\'t you go see Dr. Gettleman?  He didn\\'t die. I saw his daughter last week. Said he was fine. Her on the other hand, botched Botox.  Oh, maybe he was getting him confused with his childhood therapist.  Yeah, he used to have this recurring nightmare, just really freaked him out.  That I was going to eat him.  Hey!  What are you doing?  That\\'s so sweet. Find anything?  Nothing, huh?  \\'Slim Pickings\\'...That is so cheesy.  Honey, that\\'s okay. I actually know this woman, Nancy, who\\'s a restaurant biz head-hunter. Maybe she\\'ll know of something.  Manhattan.  I\\'m gonna miss this hand! Okay I know it\\'s a lot to ask, but oh my God Chandler, this is a once in a lifetime opportunity.  Well, if you really think about it, I mean four days is not that long. I mean, I see you Monday before you go to work, and I see you Thursday when you get back, and I always work late on Tuesdays, so really if you think about it, it\\'s really just one day. And well, if we can\\'t make it one day, we\\'ve got real problems my friend.  Really?  That\\'s the nicest anyone has ever said to me!  How was the pediatrician?  Are you serious? You still see Dr. Gettleman?  Where have you been?  Promise to call me when you land.  I love you so much.  Can I talk now?  Joey?  Ok, I don’t wanna be negative so I’ll say that most of the signs you bought are good.  Honey why don’t you go lie down.  Phoebe did the signs!  Phoebe! But I could take one of those little feet and put it in a pita pocket.  Wow, he’s really not letting this go, is he?  Breaks your heart doesn’t it  Alright here’s something, it says to try holding the baby close to your body and then swing her rapidly from side to side.  It worked!  Umm, she Rach, not it, she.  Oh my god, I am losing my mind.  Try feeding her again.  I know, that’s why I said again!  Hey.  Okay what’s up  What? Who says that?  What’s going on?  Excuse me?  Chandler, I don’t even wanna see the musical Oklahoma!  Are you trying to tell me that we’re moving to Oklahoma, or that you’re gay? All right, not that this matters, but did they at least offer you a huge raise?  Thank you.  Oh she misunderstood, she thought she was moving to Tulsa.  About a week and a half.  Rach, try holding her a different way.  You’re just new at this, it’ll get better, think about your first day at work. I mean, that couldn’t have been easy but you figured that out.  It worked! Ooh baby baby baby, ooh baby baby baby!  I can’t believe it!  She’s asleep!  I got her to go to sleep!   I have actual magical powers!  Yes I did, I’m Monica, Super Aunt  Yes I am!!  Say what?  What?  Shhh! We just got her to go to sleep  No.  Hey Phoebe... how you doin\\'? You feelin\\' better?  Ok, you got it!  Really? If that\\'s what you want...  Damn it! Rookie mistake!  What are you doing?  Okay if Mike were here what would the two of you be doing?  What are you, animals? It\\'s 4 o\\'clock in the afternoon!  And now your cell.  This is your cellphone?  This is your current cellphone?  Phoebe, where\\'s your purse?  No, no! Give it to me!  Give it to me!  I\\'ll go in there.  Phoebe come here  Haha!  Haha!  So Phoebe, why are there men\\'s shoes by the door.  Oh, when you get over this breakup we need to go shopping.  Phoebe!  Damnit Phoebe! How did you even call him?  Base Unit! Think Monica! Think!  Look, guys, you can\\'t do this, it\\'s just going to make getting over each other, that much harder.  I\\'ve been pretty good!  Oh no no no no... this is dangerous territory. Keep it clean!  You know, on the way over here, I saw this drunk guy throw up. And then a pigeon ate it!  Alright you two, I\\'m gonna go to the bathroom. Now I don\\'t want anything going on while I\\'m gone. Here\\'s a few things you can discuss: mucus, fungus and the idea of me and Ross doing it.  Didn\\'t you hear that speech? If you don\\'t kiss him then I will!  Hi, that\\'s what I\\'m doing for Phoebe!  Excuse me?  Hey, at least I knew where my guy was.  You didn\\'t hear the speech!  Hey, it was very moving! You\\'re just heartless!  You\\'re... weird!  Damn it!  And I blame you too.  Hi, glad you could come.  So, did you know Ross well?  I look like a man??  You are married though.  Awww, look at Aunt Monica\\'s little boy!  Oh, Joey, please tell me you\\'re only donating your time.  OK, we got the cole slaw, we got the buns...  Oh Joey, Melanie called, said she\\'s gonna be late.  Yeah? What does she think of your little science project?  Man\\'s got a point.  Joey... we always know what you mean.  Hey.  You\\'re going to China?  Yeah.  Oh no, she\\'s out having drinks with Carl.  You know, that guy she met at the coffeehouse.  Hey, hold on there, tiger. How\\'s it going? How you holding up?  So, uh, have you ever thought about being there for her?  Y\\'know, just be there for her.  Think about it.  I can\\'t believe he did this.  I think this is so great! I mean, you and Ross! D-did you have any idea?  From here to the airport?  Rachel, what\\'re you gonna say to him?  Yeah, but if it\\'s good news, you should tell him now.  Uh, so, uh, Rach, uh... do you wanna save this wrapping paper, I mean, it\\'s only a little bit torn... so are you gonna go for it with Ross or should I just throw it out?  Oh my God, me too! Oh! Oh, we\\'d be like friends-in-law! Y\\'know what the best part is? The best part is that you already know everything about him! I mean, it\\'s like starting on the fifteenth date!  Another good point.  Why isn\\'t it working out?  Is he not cute enough for you?  Does he not make enough money?  Is there? Is there someone else?  Then why the hell are you dumping my brother?!?  Hey, great skirt! Birthday present?  Oh, from who?  Well, it\\'s the thought. Hey, doesn\\'t Ross\\'s flight get in in a couple hours? At gate 27-B?  Oh, why?  I am not \\'so\\'! OK, I was a teensy bit weird at first, but... I\\'ll be good. I promise.  That’s also like the tenth time you told us.  What?  I thought that was a good thing.  Hey!  Yeah, there’s one right under the cabinet.  Why do you need it?  What Phoebe meant to say was umm, how come you’re having a party and we’re not invited?  Sooo?  Nooo!  The baby shower for Phoebe!  I know! Phoebe is gonna love dressing them in these!  Because she’s not gonna get to keep the babies.  Wait a minute! Unless, we give her all gifts she can use after she’s done being pregnant. Like-like umm, regular coffee, Tequila.  Oh, she’s gonna love that!  Hi Phoebe.  Hormones.  Wow, you seem to be doing so much better. That’s great. So how-how are things going?  I’m so glad you liked it.  What?!  Oh my God!  Wait, you can’t have the baby here! I mean I haven’t sterilised it since the guys moved out!  Rachel, get the book! The book!  The Bible?!  How do you feel?  Some moms do that.  Aww, sweetie, but it’s not like you’re not gonna have anything. You’re gonna have nieces and nephews, and some ways that’s even better.  I mean, you’re the one they’re gonna come to when they wanna run away from home, and the one they talk to about sex.  Yeah.  Oh my God!  What about the second minister we meet with? I kinda liked him.  Come on! It wasn’t that bad!  All right, what about the third guy?  Can you blame him?  Well then we still have a problem.  Phoebe, we’re getting married, married; not sixth grade married.  Are you serious?  We’re never gonna find anybody.  Joey look it’s really sweet…  That is true.  It might be kinda cool.  Hey Pheebs, how’s it going?  Oh, I’m sorry. Can I get you something?  It’s Hexadrin.  No Phoebe, those are like the side affects and stuff.  Y’know, the possible side affects.  Phoebe, relax none of that stuff ever happens! They just put it on there for legal reasons!  In case it happens.  You did it! You got ordained?!  Yeah!  Phoebe, your face is fine! Come on, none of this stuff is going to happen to you! Stop being such a baby!  How about receiving?  It doesn’t say that!  There you go!  No that is not what happened with us. Well, I was umm, I was really sad that night because this guy that I was Ross’s mom.  And then Chandler was, was really sweet and he consoled me. And well we drank too much…  Wouldn’t you be?  Really?  Well, not anymore.  I know, I just thought it would be fun.  Drunk enough to know that I want to do this. Not so drunk that you should feel guilty about taking advantage.  Okay!  This doesn’t feel weird!  You’re a really good kisser.  Hm-hmm!  Wow! You are really fast!  We’re gonna see each other naked.  Do you wanna do it at the same time?  One!  Two!  Eh, we weren’t that close anyway!  Okay, can we change the topic? Because it’s really doing nothing for me.  What?!  No because it-it didn’t seem important.  Noo!! The point is that is was you that was there that night! It is you that I am marrying! It is you that I feel in love with!  Chandler, please! Do you know how unbelievably glad I am that Joey was not there that night?!  Wait Chandler come on, let’s—it’s not a big deal!  Hey-hey.  Honey! Dinner’s ready!  Your favorite!  Yep! And lot’s of it!  Okay, in we go.  Oh, Larry.  Okay, knock yourself out, Larry.  Larry?  Uh, look, Larry honey, umm, I wrote the book on Section 5 and I know that you don\\'t have to wear your hat unless you\\'re in the kitchen.  It\\'s in the kitchen, I\\'ll go get it.  Thanks.  Hmm?  He\\'s not great umm, but he\\'s dealing with it. Oh wait a minute, you\\'re not gonna try…  Right, you only go for them 5 minutes before they get married.  Ohh, fun!  Well, I guess we won\\'t be warming his house.  And you\\'re not gonna do that.  So-so there is no party.  I think so. Se, he-he\\'s not inviting you to his party because he likes you.  Oh, thanks! We\\'ll try to stop by.  You are?  Okay.  What one? You wanted him to invite you to the party and he did it!  Great. So the ball is in his court?  Hey!  I don\\'t know, clean places?  The fake kind!  Okay, great!  Just go over and say hi.  Hey, Danny!  I thought there wasn\\'t a ball?  I think I need a drink.  What was it for?  Wow!  Yeah. But a part of me also can’t wait ‘til it’s over. Chandler and I have this pact not to have sex again until the wedding.  Hey Phoebe, will you give me a hand?  Uh-hmm.  Ross, she’s 25 years old.  Hey!  Subtle guys!  I know you’re planning my surprise bridal shower.  Hey! What did you decide to do about the movie?  That’s what you say about porn.  No! No you should! A lot of major actors do nude scenes! I mean the chance to star in a movie? Come on!  Hey!  Oh boy me too!  Yeah?  The wedding is off, sloppy and immature!  Shrill?! The wedding is back on!  So, are you ready to go?  Because Purvry Perverson over here can’t stop staring at her.  You were staring about eight inches south of there.  She looks exactly like Aunt Marilyn.  Wafer thin ice!  So to get this part you can’t be?  But you are?  But you told them you weren’t?  Joey! This is not like learning to ride a horse! This is like learning to…grow a turtleneck!  Oh my God, what are you gonna do?!  Unless!  Well, this may sound crazy, but there maybe something we could fashion.  Well I’m not sure yet, but umm of the top of my head I’m thinking double sided tape and some sort of luncheon meat.  Well uh, I’m trying to make something for Joey. Do you mind if I raid your fridge?  No it’s umm, more like a wrap. Okay so uh, I’m gonna go guys.  Okay, we have a lot of options here, a number of prototypes for you to try on.  Oh, just until the glue dries.  Toothpick?  What are you trying on now?  And?  Joey!  What?! Which one?!  For what?  You al-you already had it?  Well no wait a minute that’s not true! No, what did, that was really sweet. And it kinda works out for the best.  Are we gonna take a limo?  Oh I love taking limos when nobody died!  What are you doing here so early?  Well, well Ross didn’t care enough to be here, so I think he’s out. You snooze you lose.  Star in a movie.  Wait a minute, just because he paid for your head shots you’re gonna take him? Joey, I don’t think you’re comprehending just how slutty this dress is!  She’s over a week late! She gotta have it today, right?  Hmm, care to make it interesting? I’ll bet you that she’ll have it by this time tomorrow.  Okay, how much?  How about fifty bucks?  Now stop it! Double or nothing that she has it by tomorrow!  Okay.  She’s in the bathroom.  I’m actually with her on this one.  Hey!  What did the doctor say? Any news on when the baby will come?  Well what is it? What is it? If it’s gonna help bring the baby here, like today. I mean, I think you should do it.  Do it!  I’m just saying it’s been a really long time for you. I mean, women have needs. Do it, get yours!  All right, let’s be practical, if Ross isn’t willing to do it, he’s not the only guy in the world you can have sex with. You can borrow Chandler—Chandler is good!  Nothing. I just want the baby to be born today.  Okay fine! I keep betting Phoebe that you’re gonna have the baby and I don’t want to lose again!  Wait a minute! Now I’m betting against all three of you?  Oh, okay!  Two hundred.  That’s it. I’m done. I don’t care when the baby comes, no more betting.  Why?  He\\'s coming. Be cool, be cool, be cool.  We are not going to whistle.  No!  No!  Why did I \\'woo-hoo\\'? I mean, what was I hoping would happen? That-that he\\'d turn round and say \\'I love that sound, I must have you now\\'?  Phoebe, what are you doing?  I wish we at least knew his name... Look at that face. I mean, even sleeping, he looks smart. I bet he\\'s a lawyer.  Okay, he\\'s a lawyer, who teaches sculpting on the side. And- he can dance!  I wish all guys could be like him.  He doesn\\'t have anyone.  Last night.  Let\\'s see. Congress is debating a new deficit reduction bill... the mayor wants to raise subway fares again... the high today was forty-five... and- oh, teams played sports.  Nah... not-not special enough.  Waaay too special.  Yeah.  ...What did I ask?  Hi.  What are you doing here?  I\\'m not really here. Just thought I\\'d drop these off...on the way.. my way... Do you come here a lot? Without me?  How would I know? I-I wasn\\'t here.  Hey.  Hello.  No, you?  You just asked me.  Oh! You\\'re awake!  You look good!  Oh, sorry.  I\\'m Monica Geller. I\\'ve been taking care of you.  I got you the foot massager.  I read to you.  Oh, my pleasure.  \"See you around?\"  Oh, I don\\'t know. Maybe, um, \"That was nice?\" Admit something to me? \"I\\'ll call you?\"  This is so typical. Y\\'know, we give, and we give, and we give. And then- we just get nothing back! And then one day, y\\'know, it\\'s just, you wake up, and \"See you around!\" Let\\'s go, Phoebe.  What\\'s a \\'niffle\\'?  She’s sleeping.  Deep Impact was the one with Robert Duval, Armageddon is what’s going to happen to you if you wake me up.  It is in the living room where there is also a light! And no one will kick you in the shin.  Here, let me make the milk, I’m up anyway.  Okay that does sound like fun.  The second sister dies?!  The second sister dies in Archie and Jughead Double Digest?  Are you still awake?  What?! What are you doing?!  Yeah. We-we had sex and then we fell asleep.  What?!  Okay. Okay, I’m ready. Come on big fella!  Give me the good stuff.  Okay, I’m up! I’m up!  That really was some of your best work.  I have to be up in seven minutes.  Really?!  Okay! You get the vacuum cleaner and I’ll get the furniture polish!  Having a perfectly decorated tree is not what Christmas is about. It’s about being with the people that you love.  Oh, here.  Aw, I’m sorry sweetie that she doesn’t feel the same way.  Hold it! Are you talking about Dick Clark’s New Year’s Rocking Eve?  Oh my God! We love that show! I mean Ross and I have been watching it since I can remember!  We are there!  What are you talking about? She just invited him to the biggest party of the millennium!  We are going to Dick Clark’s New Year’s Rocking Eve!  Oh my God!  Okay, here comes another camera.  If we wanna get on camera, I think we have to get up on one of those platforms. They’ve been taping those people up there all day.  Oh yeah? Well when you learned how to dance did you forget how to put on underpants?  Hey, see that snippy guy over there? He’s the one who decides who gets up on the platform. We should go dance by him.  Excuse me, sir, would it help if I weren’t wearing underpants?  Man, this sucks! Y’know if Mom and Dad don’t see us on TV after we made them so jealous, I mean, who’s gonna be the losers then?  What?  Ross, we haven’t done the routine since middle school.  Was it really that good?  Okay, let’s do it. Mom and Dad are gonna be so faced!  5 6 7 8!  I know! Hey, you haven’t been practising the routine, have you?  Me too!  Ross, I think we should stick to the routine, we don’t wanna look stupid!  Hey guys! You found the presents? Chandler, you let them find the presents? Great! Do you know how long it took me to find you that water purifier?  We were on the platform, ready to dance the world into the new Millennium, and the guy yelled ‘CUT!’  What? We could do it!  Hey!  I know.  Wow!  Hey.  Oh yes, it is. I\\'m sorry I borrowed it, I was cold. I hope its okay?  I\\'m sorry, I\\'ll give it back to you.  Are you saying I smell bad?  What\\'s with him?  What is going on with you?  What was the dream about?  Wait, Joey! Joey! That doesn’t mean that-that you\\'re in love with me!  No!  Or, it could mean that-that you saw Chandler and me together and we y\\'know were being close and stuff and then you just want to have that with someone too.  Um-hmm.  You become friends after?  Joey, I thought you were gonna try to be friends first!  What about the closeness?  Who is it?  Still crying?  Y’know, I only know of two surefire ways to shut a man up. And one of them is sex.  I don’t know, I’ve never had to use the other one. I’m just saying y’know, if we’re having sex, he’s not gonna be talking.  Oh, we have some…  Um-mm.  He took up the carpet, and now you can hear everything.  I have like five times, but the guy is so charming, that I go up there to yell and then I end up apologizing to him.  All right, be my guest.  Honey, what’s the matter?  It’s Joey’s birthday.  Sush!! I cannot believe she is still up there.  I know honey, I’m sorry.  I know, he’s too charming, but if you two start going out, then it’s just gonna make it so much harder for me to hate him.  Joey, where are the Jell-o shots?  Oh my!!  How hammered are you? Huh? These, these are Joey’s sisters.  Hi.  Isn’t that great?  How ya feelin’?  What is the worse part?  Are you insane? I mean Joey, is going to kill you, he’s actually going to kill you dead.  I mean, was it Gina?  No, no, no, that’s Dina.  That was me.  That’s okay.  Y\\'know which one was she again?  No honey, I’m sorry, but the weekend’s not over yet.  I guess they’re back from their date.  Oh my God!  I am good. I finished my book.  I don’t remember. Do you wanna take a walk?  Yay!  Oh, that is amazing!  What?  Are you crazy?!  What?! Ross y\\'know this isn’t even about you! I mean this is about Rachel and something wonderful happening for her. I mean you know even if you’re right, what if he wants to sleep with her, does it mean he gets too?  I mean don’t you trust her?  Then get over yourself! Grow up!  So ah, Phoebe, how was your date?  Yeah, I do know.  Hey, Joey, I don’t think that you should leave Chandler alone. I mean it’s only been two days since he broke up with Kathy. Maybe you can go fishing next week?  What’s Phase Two?  You stink!  Uh-oh, what’s the matter?  I don’t know sweetie.  I can’t! I have to work!  No, Chandler’s still in Phase One, and Joey’s that thing you smell.  I think she’s here.  I-I-I think you look great.  What?  Oh my God!  Oh wait, Joey, you can’t go like that! You stink!  Yeah. Run ten blocks, that’ll help the smell.  So? How did it go with Joshua last night?  What?  So you hit her in the face?  Hey! You’re wearing pants!  It’s 9:30 in the morning!  Oh-oh, my God!  He’s with Emily at a Bed and Breakfast in Vermont!  He had to go, there’s a deer just outside eating fruit from the orchard.  Why do you care so much anyway?  Well, when you first met Barry, you flitted off to Vail.  A couple of days.  What are you doing?! Chandler! You can’t just go back a phase!  Yeah, come on, we can be guys!  Oh! And don’t let me leave without getting the name of that carpet guy.  So, we did okay at the strip club, right?  What, he doesn’t like Josh?  Yeah. And y’know, if you wanna cry, that’s okay too.  Come on! Chandler!  Oh, Candy! She was so spunky!  Oh, Chantal!  Really?!  That’s-that’s not Phase Three.  Hey!  Wait, now, what am I doing again?  Phoebe, you have to lift it and point.  That\\'s very nice.  Is anyone thankful for anything else besides a thong?  Oh, let\\'s not tell this story.  What-what are you doing? Is this supposed to be funny?  Well, get it off now!  Well, I don\\'t care! That-that turkey has to feed 20 people at my parent\\'s house and they\\'re not gonna eat it off your head!  Okay, count to three. 1. 2. 3!  That\\'s it. That\\'s my worse Thanksgiving.  Umm, I-I really don\\'t want to tell this story.  Look umm, of all people, you do not want me to tell this story!  Well, I do.  Yes, it was!  Hi, Chandler.  So Chandler, I guess I\\'ll see you at dinner.  Well it didn\\'t!  Yeah, I mean yeah, I look great. Yeah, I feel great and yeah, my heart is not in trouble anymore! Blah, blah, blah! Y\\'know I still don\\'t feel like I got him back, y\\'know? I just want to humiliate him. I wanna, I want him to be like naked and then I\\'m going to point at him and laugh!  How?  What?! I mean, I didn\\'t work this hard and-and-and lose all this weight so that I can give my flower to someone like him!  Yeah.  And when he\\'s naked I can throw him out in the front yard and lock the door and all the neighbors will just humiliate him!  Okay, so how do I make him think I wanna have sex with him?  What do you mean?  What?! What is it?  God, I\\'m sorry! I\\'ll go back and get it!  Wait, no-no-no, I can go really fast! Dad, give me the keys to your Porsche!  I didn\\'t mean to cut it off. It was an accident.  I\\'m sorry! It wasn\\'t your whole toe!  Chandler, I said I was sorry.  Oh wait, Chandler, come here is there anything I can do? Anything?  What?  You said you loved me! I can\\'t believe this!  Yes, you did!  You love me!  Erica, are you okay?  Oh my God!  She doesn\\'t have a stomach-ache. She\\'s in labor!  Breathe, breathe, breathe... Good.  No, last time you said it like Dracula, and it scared her! Can I get you anything? You want some more ice chips?  Alright, I\\'ll be right back.  To use the bathroom.  What?  What kind of social situation are you comfortable with?  You\\'ll be fine. Nah, you won\\'t, but I\\'ll be back in two minutes.  It\\'s just a little bit more, honey.  Oh! Oh my God! That is the most beautiful top of a head I have ever seen! Chandler, you have to see this!  Chandler, you don\\'t wanna miss this. This is the birth of your child! It\\'s the miracle of life!  It\\'s a... It\\'s a boy!  Oh, you did it!  I... I\\'m sorry, who should be along in a what now?  We only ordered one!  This is unbelievable.  What do you mean \"what do we do\"?  Chandler, you\\'re panicking!  We can\\'t split them up!  Okay, what if the person who adopts the other one is horrible?  Yeah, because I hear the king is looking to adopt.  That doesn\\'t matter! We have waited so long for this. I don\\'t care if it\\'s two babies. I don\\'t care if it\\'s three babies! I don\\'t care if the entire cast of \"Eight is Enough\" comes out of there! We are taking them home, because they are our children!  Okay!  Do you think they recognize each other from in there?  There\\'s something that we wanna tell you. We decided to name the girl-baby Erica.  Son of a gun, it is!  Okay, well, bye!  We\\'ll call you!  Oh, look at these little bunnies!  Okay.  Alright, let\\'s see..  Yeah, I\\'m good.  Yes, it\\'s twins!  Yeah, we named the boy Jack after dad.  I\\'m just so glad you got to see the babies.  I love you.  Call us when you get there.  Now, that you can do.  Oh, great! Just what you want for a new house with infants. Bird feces.  Actually, I\\'m gonna go check on the twins.  Oh God! What did I just step on?  Oh..  I\\'m sorry, I didn\\'t know to look for Chinese food on the floor.  Hello.  Oh my God! Ross, you wouldn\\'t believe the cute little noises the twins are making. Listen.  Oh, I\\'m sorry. Shoot, they were doing it before.  Oh, wait, wait, wait! Here they go again.  Isn\\'t that cute?  Oh, okay. Alright, it\\'s flight 421. Leaves at 8:40.  That\\'s what it says here. Flight 421, leaves at 8:40, Newark airport.  Newark airport. Why, where are you?  Hey! Did you find them?  Oh, well sure. This gotta be so hard. I\\'ll do it. Gimme!  Alright. My job here is done.  Yeah, they were just slowing me down. Alright, I have to get back to the babies. I\\'ll see you girls later.  Well, that\\'s it. Everything\\'s packed.  I know.  I put three lasagnas in your freezer.  Okay, please be careful with that. It was my grandmother\\'s. Be careful.  If that falls off the truck, it wouldn\\'t be the worst thing.  Oh, yeah, that\\'s true.  Wait a minute. What about that summer during college that you lived with grandma, and you tried to make it as a dancer?  Oh, honey, I forgot. I promised Treeger that we\\'d leave our keys.  We got some time.  Well at least, I’m going to mute it.  Hi!  Okay.  Hi.  Oh. Why didn’t you take her?  You must feel horrible. Hey! The guys have free porn!  Hey, cheer up! You’re gonna see her again, right?  Because! You could get to live out my fantasy!  No! Y’know, the fantasy! Meet someone from a strange land, fall in madly love, and spend the rest of your lives together.  Yeah that, plus his mom used to put sour cream on everything!  Do you love her?  You love her!  Ohhh, I knew you loved her! Then you need to go to the airport and tell her. You’re probably just gonna catch her just as she’s about to go to the gate. You’re gonna call out her name and say, \"I love you!\" And she’s gonna say, \"I love you, too!\" And you guys are going to have the most amazing kiss, everyone at the gate will applaud.  Where ya going?  How did it go with Frank and Alice?  Ohh! Did you do what I said? Did-did-did you tell her?  And well, what did she say?  Oh, you’re totally welcome! What’d she say?  It is not over! You’re over!  You know!  Hey!  Phoebe, they didn’t make you pay for those knives, did they?  Are you sure?  This isn’t how it’s supposed to go, there can’t be another guy.  Of course there’s another guy!! This is even more perfect! Now you have to prove your love!  You have to go to London!  Yeah, you have to go fight for her!  When Rachel was with Paulo, what did you do?  You sat back and let him have her, you didn’t fight at all. Am I right? Do you want the same thing to happen with Emily?  Come on! Surprise her! Show up at her doorstep! Don’t let her go without a fight!  All right.  Okay, good luck!  That’s sounds great, but how are you going to afford it?  Hello.  Oh my God! Ross, are you in England? Was Emily surprised?  All right. When is, when is the next flight out?  Okay, just stay there a couple more hours and if she doesn’t show up by then, then just come on home.  What are you doing here? You can’t be here!  Oh.  Who’s Denise?  Okay listen, y’know when you move in Rachel’s room is gonna be empty, you wanna talk about what we want to do with it?  Okay, I was thinking we should have a beautiful guest room, right? With a mahogany sleigh bed and bedside tables with flowers on them all the time! And we could have a roll top desk with comment cards on them so people could say how much they loved staying here!! Okay, whatever, I really haven’t thought about it that much.  No.  Oh, I’m sorry. Of course I mean that. Interesting idea, umm, talk about it, but no.  I just don’t think arcade games go in the beautiful guest room. The beautiful guest room is gonna be filled with antiques.  What do you have against the beautiful guest room?  Are you mocking me?  Hi.  Yeah! Oh yes!  Listen, we don’t have to make that a guest room, we can think of something to do with the room together.  Totally!  Oh good.  Changes?  You’re-you’re-you’re gonna bring the Barca Lounger over here?  Well, it’s a set and they should probably stay together.  See now-now you’re taking them away from their home.  Yeah-yeah, y’know what? Yeah, that’s it-that’s it, everything will be mine! Nothing will be yours! That’s-that’s what I said! Oh come on, Chandler! I’m talking about the barca lounger! It just, it doesn’t match! Where is it gonna go?!  Look it is not my fault that your chairs are incredibly ugly!  Ross, we can handle this.  Love is the best medicine.  Why do you do it?  Yes.  That’s very funny!  Ross, you were right before, it was just a stupid fight about a room.  Yeah, no, me neither.  You still want to move in together right?  Ross didn’t scare you?  Come here, I want to show you something!  This is where I thought the barca lounger could go! You see you could see the TV and it’s still walking distance to the kitchen.  Okay!  Uh-hmm.  Oh my God! I love that!  Uh, no!!  Rachel!  You just put an empty carton back in the fridge!  Third door on the left.  God! If you’re gonna cry about it! (She grabs the box and goes to through it out.]  Joey, please don’t do that. I think it’s best that we just forget about it.  What’s the matter?  So do them for free.  Wow! And you got a petticure. Your feet are all dressed up.  You’re gonna do some feet flirtin’!  What a minute, what did he say?  I told you not to go down there!  Rachel always cries!  Now Joey, you go down there and you suck up to him. I mean you suck like you’ve never sucked before!  His dancing partner?!  Oh, would you let it go already?! You’re fine!  Wait, now so you joined the gym?  Well, you could actually go to the gym.  Well, next time your massaging him, you should try and distract yourself.  Hey-hey, how goes the dancing? Gay yet?  Yes you did! You did like a little hop.  All right, then show me some manly moves.  So you didn’t leave the bank?  Oh my Gosh!  Are you sure you wanna do this?  Whoa!  What are you guys doing here?  Why else would we be here?  This is insane!  What are you talking about? If you get married in Vegas you’re married everywhere.  Yeah!  Hey.  How do I tell Chandler that it’s too soon. It’s gonna break his heart, he’s not gonna think that I don’t love him anymore.  Yes I do!  Oh hi! Hi! Y’know, we were just talking about bacon.  Rach! We weren’t gonna miss our friends getting married!  What are you guys gonna do?  So, what do you think we should do?  That’s a good question. Look umm, last night we let the dice decide. Maybe we should leave it up to fate again. I love you!  All right, eight we get married, but 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, 12 we don’t get married.  Ready?  Wow! I can’t believe I actually rolled an eight.  Wait a minute. That wasn’t a hard eight! Last night I rolled a hard eight.  That kid really kicked me hard on the plane.  He took my snack!  Okay! Oh God, y’know what? It’s really bad.  This doesn’t mean anything, does it?  Okay.  No, don’t say it! Don’t even think it!  I’m sick of the signs! It’s too fast, I’m happy the way things are!  I don’t want things to change! Do you?  All right then, then nothing changes! Everything is great! Everything stays the same! And you go unpack because it’s been three days and it’s driving me insane!  Then all your stuff would be here.  Then you’d be going back and forth all the time, I mean it doesn’t make any sense.  Live together? There have been no signs for that.  YES!!!!!!!!  Yes! Okay! Okay! Wait-wait-wait!  Here’s your key. All right, you have to christen it! Now, go out and come back in!  Ready!  Wait! Oh my God! I can’t get out!  No, it’s not a sign! It’s a very old key!  Oh my God it’s old!  I love you!  No.  You look cute in bubbles.  Chicken? I could eat some chicken.  Wait, what that place, that pub he took us too?  Bodington\\'s!  No, but she likes me. You abandoned her on a plane to Greece.  Rach, that\\'s great! It\\'s so good that you had a good time in Greece!  I\\'ll do it!  Oh, Rachel, sweetie, look, here\\'s a really cute picture of Joey and you at the reception.  Honey, sweetie, by the edges.  Sweetie! Edges! Fingers! Smudgey! Pictures!  Okay. That\\'s okay. I-I know that you\\'re very upset right now. I know, I know that wasn\\'t about me.  You\\'re going to talk to him! Y\\'know what? We made a deal, I make your decisions and I say you\\'re going to talk to him.  What happened?  See, didn\\'t I tell you?! You\\'re getting over Ross already!  What took you so long?  Oh, good.  Probably some y\\'know, European good-bye thing he picked up in London.  What is the matter with you?! Do you want to fall into the trap? Do you want to fall into the trap?!  I just ran into Dave and he told me that you blew him off! I mean, you listen to me! Now, I\\'m calling the shots! I say you leave Ross alone and go get Dave! What the hell were you trying to do?  I make the decisions, and I say no.  You can\\'t fire me. I make your decisions and I say, \"I\\'m not fired!\" Ha!  Rachel!! Come on! Let me in!  Rachel locked the door.  Rachel! Let me in! Rachel!  Thank you. Rachel, can I talk to you outside for a sec?  I really need to talk to you.  Okay, I will. Remember that thing that we just discussed that you wanted to do?  All right, Rachel, I know-I know you think I\\'m crazy, please, before you tell him you love him, just-just try to find one person who thinks this is a good idea. Because I bet you, you can\\'t.  Please!  Joey, I\\'m in!  Okay, well, why don\\'t we all meet upstairs in an hour?  Come on Rach, let\\'s go.  No! Rachel, you didn\\'t find anyone so you can\\'t tell him.  Okay, Rachel, do you have any idea how painful it is to tell someone that you love them and not have them say it back?  Oh my God! You\\'re water broke!  I can\\'t believe Phoebe\\'s gonna have her babies!  Do you know anything about women?  That\\'s all right.  Oh my God!  Why did they get divorced?  He’s not boring! He’s just-he’s just low key.  Thanks.  Oh no! What’s the matter?  Okay.  Bye.  Maybe Joey doesn’t have to give you the money, TV stars have assistants right?  No Joey! Chandler could be your assistant! See, he could answer all of your fan mail and stuff!  Hey Phoebe! Guess what?  Joey just hired Chandler to be his assistant!  Hey!  You are so sweet to notice! Yes, I lost three and a half pounds!  Oh my God, sit down! Sit down! How long as it been since we’ve seen each other?  Rach, he’s a friend of ours.  No.  You’re his bitch.  What?!  Yes!!  Oh my God!  Honey, having a heart attack is nature’s way of telling you to slow it down.  Sorry. So how’s it going with Joey?  Okay!!  It’s not mayonnaise!!  Hey Joey, Chandler sold a story to Archie Comics!  Yeah, a lot. A lot, a lot!  Well, y’know it’s none of my business, but aren’t you married?  Well, you’re not.  Say it louder, I don’t think the guy all the way in the back heard you!  It’s not like, I haven’t any opportunities. I mean, y’know, I’m just waiting for the perfect guy. I’m seeing this guy Roger, all right? He’s not perfect, but umm, I think maybe I should just get it over with. Y’know, give him my flower.  Y’know what? You are right?!  Rachel! I’m never gonna think it’s okay for you to cheat on your husband!  Phoebe, why is smoke coming out of the bathroom?!  Phoebe! Put that cigarette out!  Put it out!!  But, I put some honey in it.  Well, you used to like playing the guitar.  I hope you’re hungry, we’re starting with oysters. And y’know what they say about oysters, don’t you?  No! Umm well, some people say that Oysters are an aphrodisiac.  And then we’re gonna have a little Middle Eastern cous-cous. Something we can eat, with our hands.  No-no-no, no! It’s sensual!  Yeah, me too.  Stop it!! That’s not funny!!  I’m sorry, okay? It just—tonight was supposed to be y’know, it was supposed to be a big deal.  You don’t want to know what tonight was.  Well, tonight was—was going to be my first time.  All right relax Mr. I’ve Had Sex Four Times!  How many?  I was just waiting for the perfect guy.  No. He’s not a horrible guy.  Chandler, I’m gonna die a virgin!  Oh really? When? Do you wanna do it with me?  I was kidding.  Yeah but see I have nothing to compare it too. So even if you’re horrible, how would I know?  It’s harder for me! I have those four other women to compete with!  Noo!! Okay!!  Umm, do you have any uhh, moves?  Chandler?  That’s the couch.  I know! I’ll tell you something, we are gonna do that again!  Hey!  Hey, check me out, I’m a slut!  Oh I can’t. Dr. Roger is coming over again.  Are you okay?  Great! It’s so amazing! I mean, last time Dr. Roger came over, I was so nervous, but then after being with you I’m all like, \"Can the doctor see me now?\"  Yeah, come on, eat, whatever you want. Dr. Roger got beeped again.  What?!  Why would you do that?  Really?  Chandler!  There was just one woman, wasn’t there?  Including me?  What is it hon?  Aww, honey I’m sorry.  I don’t know how museums work in England but, here, you’re not supposed to take stuff.  Oh no, two days, you must be bummed.  You changed?  And lucky means, more cleavage?  Or if you want to kiss him, umm, you could use mistletoe.  Or Spin the Bottle?  Oh my God! Have you lost your mind?  I think you’re done.  Sweetie, I think the glasses look great. They make you look really sexy.  Yeah!  Oh, I already have one.  Hey, I know I what I want!  No, you don’t want this. I want to have your grandmother’s cookie recipe.  Uh-huh, yeah.  I wanted it for years! I was gonna make cookies for my children.  Okay. I’m gonna be the mom that makes the world’s best chocolate chip cookies.  Oh, so you finally took it out of the marina huh?  What?  Wow! That’s great! Dad must really like you, he doesn’t ask just anyone to play.  This is so cool, maybe this is something you can do every week.  Oh, just so you know, you-you have to let him win.  He hates to lose.  What’s wrong Phoebe?  No!! Why didn’t you make a copy and-and keep it in a fireproof box and keep it at least a hundred yards from the original?!!  No! Wait! I think I can figure out the recipe from this cookie! I do stuff like this at work all the time.  Yeah! I bet I can do it.  All right, I definitely taste nutmeg.  Hey! How was sailing?  Hey! How was it?  Oh my God Chandler! I can’t believe it!  You gave my father a lap dance!  Listen, I’m sure that dad doesn’t care. He probably thought this was funny; he’ll be telling this story for years!  I wasn’t escaping.  I was trying to help out a squirrel.  Okay, here’s batch 22. Ohh, maybe these’ll taste a little like your grandmother’s. This has a little bit of orange peel, but no nutmeg.  Okay. Man, I have not made this many cookies since I was in the ninth grade.  No, just a Friday night.  The ones we had right after you almost threw up.  Well, I’ve tried everything. I give up. I guess I’m not gonna be the mom who makes the world’s best chocolate cookies. I do make the best duck confit with broccoli rabe.  Kids love that right.  Well, I mean what about friends of your grandmother’s? Wouldn’t they have the recipe?  What was her name?  Nestle Tollhouse?!  I cannot believe that I just spent the last two days trying to figure out the recipe and it was in my cupboard the whole time!  What does the red X next to Bob Greenmore\\'s name mean?  Hey, you wanna go to see a movie?  Oh, right.  Oh, well. Now that I\\'m here I might as well help you with the cleaning and organizing! Just happen to have my label maker!  Uh, Chandler did! What does he want you to give up?  Well, of course I do. What\\'s not to like! I\\'ll take her in a minute! But, you know, I think that you\\'re giving up too easy, honey. I think that you need to fight for her!  Absolutely! Yes, you say to him \"I\\'m sorry Mike I can\\'t live without her, she means too much to me!\"  Damn it, I did not think this through!  Hey, how did it go with Mike, is he gonna let you keep the painting?  Wow, what\\'s the bad news!  Huh!  You know, I would give her up, for you.  But I want to.  But I insist!  No, that landed in your food!  Hey! I sold that to Joey.  No you can\\'t. She\\'s yours!  SHE\\'S YOURS!  She\\'s m-i-i-ne!  She\\'s mine!  She\\'s mine!  She\\'s mine!  Oh my God!  Wh-what are we gonna tell him?  And I have costumes.  Phoebe, do you think that your favorite animal says much about you?  Still get a discount on wedding dresses?  I’m so happy for you!  What?!  Oooh!  I can’t tell you. It’s a secret.  Really? Okay, so why don’t you tell me what happened to Ross Junior year at Disneyland?  If you tell me, I’ll tell you what Phoebe said.  Okay.  Oh my God. He threw up?  Oh, Nancy Thompson from Phoebe’s old massage place is getting fired.  Hey! Good, you’re home!  I made you a surprise.  Yeah, tacos! Ever since you told me that story I’ve had such a craving for them.  Ross!  Excuse me Mr. Mexico.  Ross used to stay up every Saturday night to watch Golden Girls!  It’s hard for some people!  Chandler one time wore my underwear to work!  Ohh, I’m sorry I couldn’t think of anymore for Ross!  Y’know, in my defense, umm there was no glitter on the macaroni and very little glue.  No!  Yeah?  Ohh, absolutely.  Yeah, definitely!  Then, I’d steer clear of Phoebe.  That’s not ‘til Thursday.  They won’t be ready for weeks.  Okay.  Ross has never checked out of a room a minute before he had to.  Hey!  A tiny salt shaker!!!  Oh wow! Okay. Well that was fun.  Good. Okay, I’m just gonna wait for Chandler to open the rest of them.  Whew. Although y’know, this is part of a salt and pepper set. I mean… I guess y’know it may just count as a half a present. What do you think?  Hey, how are you feelin’? Any morning sickness?  No! Joey and Ross don’t know anything and Chandler still thinks that Phoebe’s pregnant.  Wow. Y’know it is so weird. I mean, you’re gonna tell this guy today and he has no idea what’s gonna happen.  What was that bam?  Who’s David Lynn?  No! No! I shouldn’t have even opened these! I mean I—Joey I am out of control!! Joey, you have to do me a favor. No matter what I say, no matter what I do, please do not let me open another present! Okay?  Give me one more.  Oh my God! Joey!  You can’t marry him!  Phoebe!  She’s not pregnant. It’s Rachel. Rachel’s the one who’s pregnant.  Phoebe I think he would notice if you didn’t have a baby in nine months!  There’s a dude?  People have got to finish their stories!  I know! I know! I am a terrible person! I mean, Chandler is never going to trust me with anything ever again!  Yeah. What is that?  Hey! How’d it go?  So are you ever gonna tell whoever it is?  What?!  Wow! That is a great picture!  That would be a good idea.  You kissed another woman!  Ohh, everybody at the restaurant still hates me.  I mean they’re trying to do everything they can to make me quit, and if there were any other job, I would. But this is something I’ve been waiting for my whole life.  I would love too, but I can’t! I mean I just can’t, you know that I’m not good at confrontation.  That’s a good idea! Wait, do you know how to waiter?  All right, you’re hired!  Didn’t your dad used to call you Pumpkin?  You want a problem? I’ll give you a problem!  You bet your ass, I’m gonna fire you! Thank you.  Hey.  They baked it. I can’t take this anymore. I’m gonna call a meeting tonight, I’m gonna fire you tonight.  What are you doing?!  Hey, Joey, could you pass the cheese?  Okay. Could the waiters gather around to hear tonight’s specials? Okay, first there is a Chilean Sea Bass prepared with a Mango relish on a bag—Why is nobody writing these down?  Because your all gonna make up fake specials and make me cook them like you did the other night?  What the hell happened?!  Joey, we had a deal. That-that’s why you’re here! I’ve got to fire you!  What kinda things have you been saying?  You did a minute ago!  Fine!  That’s not funny.  You do?  Well if you want a problem? I’ll give you a problem!  How about if I dance around all covered in sauce? Huh? You think it’s funny now?  Thanks.  Enough!  Ooh, Phoebe, you look great!  Hang on a second I just got in.  Rach, did you check the machine?  What if it\\'s new? I mean, we agreed not to talk again, unless we had something really important to say. Shouldn\\'t I call him back?  Huh?  If it is a new message, what is he calling to say?  So, should I call him back?  I called him.  Yes. Well I got his machine and I left a message. But it\\'s okay, it\\'s okay, it\\'s okay, because you know it was like a casual, breezy message. It was breezy! Oh God, what if it wasn\\'t breezy?  Here, I got it. I\\'ll will play my message for you guys, and you can tell me if it\\'s breezy enough.  I know the code to his answering machine.  He\\'s seeing someone. I can\\'t believe he\\'s seeing someone.  Well, who\\'s voice was that?  Michelle! Of course, it was Michelle! Did it sound like Michelle?  It was Michelle. It was definitely Michelle.  Okay. That was her right?  See there you go. Woo! We\\'re out of the woods. Okay, I\\'ll get dressed now.  Not any more!  Hi, uh, Richard it\\'s Monica, um, listen I did something kind of crazy tonight, um, maybe I\\'m getting my period or something, I don\\'t know. Um, anyway, I, I, I beeped into your machine and I heard a message that, that freaked me out, and um, you know what Michelle will tell you the rest. I, I, um, I\\'m sorry, okay, I, I hope that we can forget the whole thing. Okay, bye.  Outgoing! Did that say outgoing?! Not, outgoing!!!  I don\\'t know!  Noooo!!!!  Maybe we could call the phone company. Maybe they could change the message. Maybe they can change his number.  Well, instead of being sad that tonight is my last night together with Rachel we thought we’d go out to dinner and celebrate the fact that Rachel is moving in with Phoebe.  It’s not your birthday.  You’re not dressed yet?! We’re supposed to start having fun in 15 minutes!  Rachel, you are packed though right, I mean please tell me that you’re packed.  What?  You’re plans were with us.  All right, Chandler can make boxes, Ross can wrap, and Joey can lift things. Now Phoebe, go tell the guys they have to help out!  I thought you said you were going to do nothing.  Okay fine, now Ross…  Why not?  It’s almost 8 o’clock, it’s almost past his bedtime. Where-where is he?  Is he really coming? Because I can see right into your apartment!  No.  I’m gonna miss you so much.  I don’t think there’s anything.  Nope, she’s perfect.  Aw, sometimes. Always, actually.  Not just the phone pen. I never get my messages.  Yeah, well I don’t think it really counts if you have to read them off the back of your hand after you fall asleep on the couch.  Oh, put him on!  \"Hi I’m Rachel, is my sweater too tight? No? Oh, I’d better wash it and shrink it!\"  \"Oh my God, I love Ross! I hate Ross! I love Ross! I hate Ross!\"  I’m not talking to her!  Well, maybe you’re right—She made fun of my phone pen!  What?!  It needs to go about 20 blocks to the left!  Because it’s my apartment!  No Phoebe I am mad!  Well, this is the last box of your clothes. I’m just gonna label it, \"What were you thinking?\"  Whoa-whoa-whoa, Phoebe you gotta take her! Y’know I-I-I said some really bad stuff about her, but y’know Rachel has some good qualities that make her a good roommate.  Y’know she has 147,000 pairs of boots…  She lets you borrow them.  When I take a shower, she leaves me little notes on the mirror.  When I fall asleep on the couch after reading, she covers me over with a blanket.  Hey. Call me when you get there. Okay?  I’m really gonna miss you.  Thanks.  Yeah.  Bye.  She really left.  Thank you.  Can I ask you a question?  What’s the big deal?  Ross let me ask you a question. All jokes aside, where is this relationship going?  Do you really see this as a long-term thing?  Hi guys.  What are you doing?  Are you okay?  Yeah. I’m okay. I’m actually—I’m a little cold, can I have your jacket?  Ohh that’s sweet!  Oh God, maybe he won’t see us. Richard!  Hey, it’s good to see you!  Yeah—Oh that’s right. You, you always wanted me too. Hey, I see you got your mustache back.  Chandler, wh-why don’t we sit down?  And so, we’re hiding in the bathroom.  So I hide in the shower and the next thing you know they’re going at it right on the bathroom floor.  Ohh.  I thought you were going out with Elizabeth.  Oh Ross, sometimes grown-ups have commitments they just can’t get out of!  If the school finds out you’re fired.  She’s leaving for three months.  Okay well I think…that’s your answer.  Why do you want to see my hand?  What are you up too?  Well that’s a little crazy. Although I am y’know glad to hear that you’re branching out on what you look at on the Internet.  Why?! To celebrate your relationship! To solidify your commitment! To declare your love for one another to the world!  Okay well that’s good to know.  Richard!  Ohh… Oh, that’s okay I hate when people come back to complement the chef. Like I have nothing better to do! So what’s up?  Oh, good to see you too. Did you come down here to tell me that?  What uh—What did you—What?!  Y’know you’re really not supposed to be back here!  What the… Yes you’re too late! Where was all this three years ago?!  What were you doing in Africa?  Ohhh! What are you doing to me?! Oh look, I-I… I’m sorry but umm, this-this-this-this is not going to happen.  Well he is! Yeah, I mean marriage is all he talks about! My goodness, in fact, I’m the one that’s making him wait!  Yeah!  Why? Because of the government.  So that marriage stuff that you were saying yesterday, you don’t really believe that do you?  Yeah, but that’s pigs not people!  Wait a minute. Are you honestly telling me that-that you may never want to get married?  Oh my God! Then-then-then what are we even doing?! What is this?!  Y’know what?! I gotta go! Ugh!  Have you seen Rachel? Or a mirror?  Yeah, it’s great.  I’m just having one of those days where you realize you’re in a dead-end relationship!  It’s not like I want to get married tomorrow! It’s just that I-I’d like to believe that I’m in a relationship that’s actually going somewhere, that I’m not just wasting my time!  No I don’t know Chandler! Not anymore! It’s like it’s like something’s changed.  I didn’t change!  What?!  Is that some kind of boat talk?  What does he think? Does he think I’m just gonna wait around for nothing?  Yeah! Richard!  That’s right.  You just told me that he hates marriage! That-that he’s a-a complex fellow who’s unlikely to take a wife! That-that he’s against marriage and always will be!  Hi.  I don’t know why I’m here.  I don’t know.  Yeah, I’ll have a scotch…  No that’s, that’s okay.  Uh yeah, I-I actually I thought about you a couple months ago.  Yeah but it was because I-I had an eye exam and I don’t like my new eye doctor.  Edward Nevski?  No.  But getting over was the hardest thing that I’ve ever had to do. And I never let myself think about you.  I missed this apartment! Now, this is a grown-up’s apartment! Y’know, I-I should be with a grown-up, do you know what I mean?!  Y’know, let’s face it, I’m not a kid anymore! I-I need to be with someone who-who wants the same things that I do! I mean coming to my place of work and telling me that you love me, I want that! Talking about pig sex over lunch, I don’t want that!  Fair? Please don’t even talk to me about fair! Fair would’ve been you wanting to marry me back then! Or fair would’ve been Chandler wanting to marry me now! Believe me, nothing about this is fair! Nothing! Nothing! Nothing! Nothing! Nothing! Nothing! Nothing! Nothing! Nothing! Nothing!  Y’know, I-I… I have to figure…some st—Y’know, some stuff before I can…  You wanted it to be a surprise.  Yes.  I knew you were likely to take a wife!  Oh…  So, you think you\\'ll do it on his couch?  Hey, how long are you in the city?  Hello?  C\\'mon up.  Wait-wait, go back to that sibling thing.  Oh! So you think I\\'m a failure!  Y\\'know, all these years, I thought you were on my side. But maybe what you were doing was sucking up to Mom and Dad so they\\'d keep liking you better!  You\\'re welcome.  Hi...May I help you?  Okay...who are you?  Oh, c\\'mon in.  How\\'s it going?  Nothing, um, it\\'s just, um... It\\'s Roger.  So you talked to your dad, huh.  How\\'s it going?  Joey!! What the hell were you doing?!  Hello, Joey.  Chandler gets pedicures!  There. Here\\'s their card.  Hey Phoebe!  I know, Amanda! Ah! She called me too! She\\'s the worst!  I know, and she\\'s always bragging about all the famous people she\\'s met.  Oh, what are we gonna do! I don\\'t wanna see her!!  What?  It could be Amanda!  You\\'re from Yonkers! Your last name is Buffo-Martisis!  We weren’t picking up, it’s Amanda!  Well, I said \\'no\\' to her coming over now! I couldn’t say \\'no\\' twice! I get this uncontrollable need to please people!  And you would?  How could you mess this up? It\\'s so easy? You go into the booth, you count to five and you turn around!!  One Two Three...  Wow, really? One time he just looked at my bra and it popped open.  Well, you guys have been friends forever. Remember the first time that you kissed Ross? How weird that was? You couldn\\'t stop laughing? You got through that.  Hey Phoebe!  Is Amanda here yet?  Well, what do you think of Mike and Chandler being in a car accident?  Hi!  When were we not friends?  Ehm, we were friends in 1992.  Oh My God!  We are not friends with Phoebe anymore.  I have nothing to say to you.  I can\\'t believe you tried to cut me out. Why Phoebe, why?  I\\'m still all those things!  It\\'s because I\\'m scrappy.  I won\\'t know what I would do without you.  Well, I guess we should go back in. When you gave me another chance, I guess we should do the same for Amanda.  Okay, the reason why I asked you guys out to brunch today is because I have been doing some thinking about who should be my maid of honor.  First of all um, I love you both so much and you’re both so important to me…  Well umm, I was thinking that maybe we could come up with a system where we trade of being maid of honor for each other. Like hypothetically, if Phoebe were mine…  If Phoebe were my maid of honor…  Rachel would be Phoebe’s, I would be Rachel’s, that way we all get to do it once and no one would get upset.  Because then I don’t have to!  I’m really not deciding!  Yeah that’s right.  Yeah hey, a weird thing happened today whey I was at brunch. This woman overheard that I was marrying you and-and then she…she wished me good luck.  She was like 30, dark hair, attractive.  Come on, was it somebody maybe you dated in college?  What are you doing?  Oh my God yes! Who is she?  Did you break up with her?  Why?  Fat?!  You broke up with a girl because she was fat?!  Well, apparently she does.  You’re Lewis Posin.  Lewis Posin! He was my best friend in fifth grade, and-and then one day I asked him to be my boyfriend and he said no. Do you know why?  No, I know. But y’know what? It would make me feel better if Lewis apologized to me.  It’s pretty clear.  Why don’t you just stop doing stupid things? Then you wouldn’t have to apologize.  All right, I…I have to ask.  Are you gonna break up with me if I get fat again?  Well, you broke up with Julie Grath! How much weight could she have gained?  In one year?! My God what did she eat? Her-her family! That’s not the point.  Well… That’s not the only time this was an issue. You remember when umm, you spent Thanksgiving with us? You called me fat.  How?  What if I have babies, okay? I mean I’m gonna look different. I’m okay with that, but I’m not sure that you are!  Keep going.  Even if I shrink down to two inches tall?  Did anybody else feel they just wanted to peel the skin off their body, to have something else to do?  Well, go over to her! She\\'s not with anyone.  You could do that!  Oh, right, right. How was your date, \\'Chand-lrr\\'?  Oh. I\\'m sorry it didn\\'t work out.  Didn\\'t you listen to the story? I mean, this is twisted! How could you get involved with a woman like this?  What? So you guys don\\'t mind going out with someone else who\\'s going out with someone else?  Good for you, Joey.  We\\'re kidding. C\\'mon, tell us!  ...Oh! I-I see you moved the green ottoman.  How-how did that happen?  You guys, I am not that bad!  That is so unfair!  Okay, so I\\'m responsible, I\\'m organised. But hey, I can be a kook.  Why not?  I could do that.  Why would someone do that?! ...One might wonder.  STOP IT!! ...Oh my God. It\\'s true! Who am I?  Well, what\\'s the part?  Alright, alright, alright...  For what?  Oh my God. Okay, go into the bathroom, use whatever you want, just don\\'t ever tell me what you did in there.  He\\'s in the bathroom. I don\\'t think you wanna go in there!  I warned you...  Oh, you got the whole night, huh?  Sure. Oh, um, Chandler? Y\\'know, the-the old Monica would-would remind you to scrub that Teflon pan with a plastic brush...But I\\'m not gonna do that.  Hey, waitwait, aren\\'t you the guy that plays the butt in the new Al Pacino movie?  Maybe this wasn\\'t your shot.  I\\'m sorry, Joey. I\\'m gonna go to bed, guys.  I’m glad you’re here, we have a couple of things to ask you about the wedding ceremony.  Uh, so anyway, we thought one of you could read something during the ceremony.  Okay, so Ross will be doing the reading.  Do you mind telling us what it is?  What is DOOL?  Who are they killing off?  She’s my favorite character on DOOL.  And the way she slaps all the time!  What is that?  It sounds like it’s coming from across the street.  What?  Nooo!!  He cannot play at our wedding! I mean everyone will leave! I mean come on, that is just noise! It’s not even a song!  Do you want some shortbread? Eh that’s Scottish like you are.  No! No-no they’re not. They’re still very angry! But y’know Chandler is also half-Swedish. You know what the Swedish people are famous for? Sitting down and being quiet.  Nice to meet you! My God you’re great!  Hey, Rach, you\\'re leaving tomorrow, shouldn\\'t you be packing?  Oh, yeah, right! And after I took a shower this morning I just threw my towel on the floor! Oh God, it hurts to even joke about it.  Oh, wow, can you believe you\\'re like three weeks away?  You don\\'t mind me touching your belly, do you?  Yeah, and I wanted her to get to know the doctors and get settled into the hotel.  Because we\\'re moving in a couple of days and it just didn\\'t make sense.  Ross! She\\'s giving us her baby. She can eat you if she wants.  Oh, I know. I know. Hey, you know, you can take it if you want! The lease is still in Nana\\'s name.  Yeah, it takes two incomes.  Oh, no. He doesn\\'t have time for that. But if you want, you can go help him and Joey pack up the guest room.  Mhm, helpful brother - creepy loner at teen movie.  From?  All right, Rachel\\'s party is in a couple of hours and there\\'s a lot to do. Now, Ross, you got Geller blood, you\\'re in charge of these yahoos!  Hey! Where\\'s Mike?  Well, I thought this would be a great opportunity to use up all the food that I don\\'t want to move to the new house with me! So, enjoy: smoke oyster casserole with a breakfast cereal crust, kidney beans in their own juices, and for dessert, a questionable orange.  Yeah.  Come here, I\\'ll make you a drink.  What are you talking about? These aren\\'t mine.  That would be a terrible punishment. But, I\\'m serious, I\\'ve never seen these before.  Rachel used to live in that room.  Joey\\'s bare ass!  Yeah?  Sure.  No.  I know what you mean. You\\'re like a sister to me too.  What?  You cried yesterday at the six o\\'clock news.  Well, maybe she thought that with all of your history it could be, you know, implicit.  Yeah. Mine too.  And say what? \"You owe me a goodbye\", I mean, he\\'s got more pride than that.  I hope Ross isn\\'t too upset.  Uh, where do you think you\\'re going?  We\\'re moving in a couple of days and we\\'ve got a lot of packing to do. It would be great if you guys could pitch in.  Oh no! You and Phoebe are gonna help me in here.  Okay, we\\'re gonna start in the kitchen. Plates get put into plate protectors and stacked ten to a box. The silverware gets bundled in rubber bands and then bubble wrapped. Got it?  Good! Now I need you to be careful and efficient. And remember, if I am harsh with you, it is only because you are doing it wrong.  You did? How?  Nana liked it rough!  Erica, are you okay?  Oh my God!  She doesn\\'t have a stomach ache, she\\'s in labor.  Okay, okay... Okay, I feel a little better.  Oh... Yes, I\\'m sure. Oh honey, let\\'s go. Okay bye everyone.  God, this adoption stuff is so overwhelming. There\\'s inter-country adoption, dependency adoption.. There are so many ways to go, and this is like the biggest decision of our lives.  Hey.  That\\'s sweet. Drink your hair.  Oh, they\\'re brochures from different adoption agencies.  That\\'s not really how it works.  I don\\'t know!  Thanks, that would be great. Hey, honey, wouldn\\'t that be great?  Hi Frank.  Oh, my goodness, they\\'ve all gotten so big!  Which one is which again?  Thank you so much for seeing us. Phoebe has told us such great things about you guys.  Well, we appreciate anything you can tell us.  Oh my god!  It\\'s.. It\\'s just so pretty and white.  Can I adopt you?  They\\'re in the kitchen getting something to eat. Can you believe how nice they are?  Why? What did you do in the bathroom?  Oh my god, where\\'s my purse? No, you know what? I can replace everything in there. Get that binder, and let\\'s go!  Hey, Phoebs  Uhm, we just wanna give you a heads-up. Bill and Colleen hate us.  What?  I think our lover’s spat will start a little early this month.  We know how tough those parent/teacher conferences can be.  Ross!!  How crazy that we’d run into you!  Y’know, it is so strange seeing Ross here this time of day, ‘cause usually he’s got the children’s hospital.  And he’s a great brother!  Ohh!  No, you said the baby creeps you out.  You said the baby.  Why would the little girl creep you out?  What?! Excuse me!  How was your first day?  Well y’know Joey, you’re a pretty charming guy.  No sweetie, you’ve got to win over the guy that controls C.H.E.E.S.E.! You’ve got to kiss some serious robot ass!  Yeah! That’s why I’m sleeping with him on the side.  Phoebe, stop writing about us!  Okay fine! Fine! Then you know what, I’ll just write about Phyllis! Hmm!  Chandler, we said we would meet at the coffeehouse at six.  We said six!  Yeah and if I had seven, maybe I would’ve said something like this, \"Wow! My boyfriend’s such a wise ass—seven!\"  Ugh!  What time?  Inside of telling us you decided to write in your stupid book!  Look at us all dressed up for the big office party! By the way, what are we celebrating?  I think this is so cool because none of our friends are here and we can be a real couple. We don\\'t have to hide.  Hi, nice to meet you!  What was that?  That noise you just made?  Really? Your work laugh?  All right, check me out.  Really?  Hey, I thought you already had one.  Hi!  What are you doing here? I thought you had to do inventory all day.  Uhh, not much. Uh, work\\'s good.  Okay. Umm…  Okay, what\\'s going on with you?  Well, I-I—there was this guy at the bank that I thought was cute umm, but I don\\'t anymore.  Yes, I\\'m sure! Rachel is there something that you want to talk me about?  Game!  Am I on fire today or what?! Those birds are browned, basted, and ready to be carved!  I\\'m sorry, I don\\'t understand what you just said.  Are you crazy?! We own those two! I mean look at \\'um, he can\\'t breath and she\\'s popping pills.  They have racquets don\\'t they?!  I\\'ll take it down to 95% but that\\'s the best I can do.  I got it!!  I can\\'t believe you let them win!  I was frustrated.  I was frustrated with you!  I\\'m telling you, something\\'s wrong! My brother does not stay out all night.  My turn? What-what are you talking about?  What?!  Well. Sounds like you\\'re writing yourself a little play there Rach. Wow! Let me know how that one turns out.  Mr. Bigot. He tells the most racist jokes.  Oh, none for me. Thanks.  Y\\'know, I-I-I don\\'t think that I can. So if you don\\'t mind, maybe this will be it for me on the work things.  I\\'d rather hang out with a sniveling work weasel guy when I can be hanging out with my boyfriend who I actually respect.  Yeah! I mean it was really funny, I-I just don\\'t think you got it. You see Kara\\'s coffee is-is-is weak tasting, okay? But-but what Doug was-was imply that it was weak physically. You get it now honey?  I thought you could use the help.  Sorry! I\\'m just—I\\'m not very good at this! I\\'m a terrible liar and I hate having to lie to Rachel!  I know! It\\'s just that…ever since high school Rachel was the one person I told everything too. Y\\'know? I miss that so much now. She\\'s my best friend.  Wh-wh-what are you doing here? (She tries to pull her shirt down to cover the fact that she\\'s wearing men\\'s boxers.]  Okay great!  Great! Umm, well what-what I was doing in Chandler\\'s room is that umm, I was cleaning it! In fact, he pays me to clean it!  Y\\'know when I said to you earlier that I was at work umm, I\\'m at my new work.  Okay.  I\\'ll get back to my new job.  Hi sweetie!  Oh, so much fun. But the best part is, we met this incredible couple on the way back.  No, they were really cool. They were on their honeymoon too!  Yeah, can we go call them? Is it too soon to call? I wanna call.  I know.  This is different! Greg and Jenny are in a relationship.  We didn’t get anything for anyone.  That you can have.  It was great! It was great! How about you?! I mean you’re having a baby!  All right, so now that Ross knows can you tell us y’know how it happened? I mean, when did it happen? How many times did it happen?  Do you still wanna call ‘em? I wanna call ‘em.  What?! People don’t do that!  They gave us a fake number? Why? Why would they do that?  And you’ve never been funnier. Joke, joke, joke, you were a hoot!  Yeah, definitely.  I still don\\'t get why Greg and Jenny would give us a fake number.  Okay, maybe people give out fake numbers, but they don’t give out fake names.  I know! Although, you did tell an awful lot of jokes.  What about my questions?  Oh, I’m sorry. Was that another joke?  Hell yeah!!!  I know.  You used the Europe story!  I\\'m telling you, she went to the airport, and she\\'s gonna go for it with Ross!  Guys, you got your hair cut.  This is amazing. I mean, how, how did this happen?  Pheebes, you know what I\\'m thinking?  No, although now that\\'s what I\\'m thinking.  Well, I was thinking, that you gave the guys such great haircuts, I thought, maybe you\\'d like to do mine?  Why not?  No you\\'re not.  Sweetie, I wanted you to have him too.  Rachel, how did this happen?  Honey, you\\'re not pathetic, you\\'re sad.  I promise.  What? I didn\\'t say anything.  I\\'m sorry. I\\'m sorry, Phoebe. It\\'s just a little shorter than what we had discussed.  How who wears it?  Demi Moore is not a he.  That\\'s Dudley Moore. I said I wanted it like Demi Moore.  Oh my God!  Oh my God!  She\\'s the actress that was in Disclosure, Indecent Proposal, Ghost!  I know!  Even Mary Tyler Moore would\\'ve been better.  Thank you. My hair is very amused.  David, can you help me?! I\\'m trying to explain to Chandler how a plane stays in the air.  Alright, I\\'m gonna go pick up a few things for the trip.  At least you took me down with you!  I guess, in time.  I mean, my feelings for Richard are certainly gone.  Wow! That Mike thing was interesting! I don\\'t know what\\'s gonna happen with Phoebe and David.  Ok, I\\'m sensing that this is some kind of word play, because you are pink with barely controlled glee.  Chandler, we have talked about this. You are not supposed to give people advice! Now couldn\\'t you just have made some sort of inappropriate joke?  They\\'ve only been going out for a few weeks and Phoebe is completely hung up on Mike! She\\'ll say \"No\", David\\'s heart will be broken, it will be too hard for them to recover from and then Phoebe will end up alone again.  Ok! When I go places with high humidity, it gets a little extra body, ok?!  Yeah, right!  Ok!  See what happens when you give people advice? I hope you told him not to?  Ok, my husband just gave your boyfriend some very bad advice. Look, David is going to propose to you tonight.  What are you serious? You wanna marry him? Wha... What about Mike?  Do you really think marrying someone else is the right answer?  Ok, Mike, enough is enough, now you love Phoebe and she loves you, so you need to get over your whole \"I never want to get married\" thing and step up!  This is Monica! I\\'m Phoebe\\'s friend. Listen, Phoebe is back with David and he\\'s going to propose to her, and she is going to say \"yes\" but I know she really wants to be with you!  Phoebe is going to say \"Yes\" to David. See, that\\'s what happens when you meddle in people\\'s lives!  No it\\'s not, b\\'cause she\\'s still in love with Mike!  No, I called him. It\\'s not gonna happen.  Well, if you hadn\\'t meddled to start with, I wouldn\\'t have had to go in there and meddle myself. Now, no matter how much we meddle, we will never be able to un-meddle the thing that you meddled up - in the first place!  I can\\'t believe she\\'s gonna say yes to David. She\\'s clearly in love with Mike.  Oh my God, he\\'s gonna do it now. Please, I cannot watch this, let\\'s go.  IT\\'S THE HUMIDITY!  The sun is out!  Ok listen, you go down to the pool and reserve the chairs, and I\\'ll get the magazines and the lotion.  Damn it!  Yeah!  So, what are we gonna do today?  I\\'m not always that bad!  ... Phoebe...?  I clunked your heads together!  C\\'mon guys, it\\'ll be fun!  But then how do we know who wins?  So, we\\'re just four losers... SUPER!  Sure! Got to!  Aww!  Hell, yeah!  How much were you thinking?  Make it fifty!  Heads! No, Tails! He-he-heads!  Ha! My point!  Ooh! I\\'m sorry! I think, I THINK, that may have missed the table!  Ah, yeah!  Ah, yeaaah!  AH YEAAAAH!  Oh, damn it!  NO, NO, NOOO!  Best out of three?  No, I have just to have two more points to beat him!  I can\\'t just walk away! I\\'ve put in four hours!  Look! You knew this about me when you married me! You agreed to take me in sickness and in health. Well, this is my sickness!  That\\'s just good sense!  What?  But... you suck!  Oh my God! You\\'re good!  Why?  This is so great! Now we can enter into doubles tournaments!  Oh, this is so great.  Hello, people who do not live here.  I gave you a key for emergencies!  He’s great! I mean we have such a good time together! He’s so funny, and sooo sweet, and I’m not attracted to him at all!!  Noo!! It’s driving me crazy. I mean every other way he’s like the perfect guy, he has everything. Plus! He actually has everything.  Two.  Sure.  Okay. Umm, y\\'know, I don’t think, I don’t think I told you this, but umm, I just got out of a really serious relationship.  So I did tell you. Okay, y\\'know, that really isn’t the thing. Umm, the thing is that, right now I’m just in a place in my life where I need to focus on me. Y\\'know what I mean?  I so wanna be attracted to you.  I’m sorry.  It’s not?  Well, um, look I-I don’t want this to come our wrong, but ah, you seem awfully confident for a guy I just told I wasn’t attracted too.  Hey, Rach, how was work?  By the way, Ross dropped by a box of your stuff.  Something wrong?  Y’know what? It really creeps me out choosing other people’s sex clothes.  Um-hmm.  Well, you’re making him a frieze salad with goat cheese and pine nuts, wild nuts, wild rice, roast asparagus, and salmon au croup.  So, you wore your nightie to dinner?  Oh, no!  Emily’s straight.  This totally makes sense!  Oh, sure it does! In high school, you weren’t jealous at all even though all your girlfriends were cheating on you!  This is so much fun!  Look, all we’re trying to say is, don’t let what happened with Carol ruin what you got with Emily.  Probably the only time I\\'ll ever say this, but did you see the ass on her?  Sixty guests.  Because I don\\'t have the money or the equipment to handle something that big on such short notice. I mean there\\'s no way.  I don\\'t know.  Really? Cause I\\'d need like $500 for all the food and the supplies and stuff.  Well, you\\'re not working either.  Yeah, that\\'d be great! Thank you!  Hey!  Oh my God, it was the best funeral ever! I mean, everyone loved the food, and guess what? I even got another funeral for tomorrow—the dead-guy-from-today\\'s best friend. I mean, it is like I am the official caterer for that accident!  Oh. Well, I didn\\'t realize that you needed it back right away. I mean, you told me to go and be a caterer. So I went. I beed. I mean, I... I used it to buy all this stuff. But look—I\\'ve got another job tomorrow, so I\\'ll pay you back with the money I make from that.  Okay.  Oh, is everything in the car?  No. I hate this part.  No, that\\'s not mine.  Excuse me, Mrs. Burkart? Well, we\\'re all cleaned up in the kitchen.  Um, and, well there\\'s the.. the the small matter of...  Just the matter of ...payment?  Oh, Phoebe, she couldn\\'t stop crying! With those thick glasses, her tears looked giant.  What?  Okay. So what do you.... you think she\\'s faking?  Phoebe, she sounded pretty upset to me.  Maybe I can try at intermission? Phoebe, come on... you know what? Let\\'s just go!  I\\'m gonna leave some cards here. Please think of us for you next event.  Oh, that\\'s great! Congratulations!  Oh, it was great! The widow wouldn\\'t pay, so Phoebe yelled at her \\'til she did.  And I\\'m a wuss. And we should be partners.  Wait a minute, Phoebe! We should be partners. We should be catering partners. I mean, think about it! You\\'re not working right now, and we have such a great time together!  I can cook and you can take care of the money.  Hi. Uh, you... you don\\'t know me, I\\'m Monica Geller... Ross\\'s sister.  Yeah. Anyway, he told me about your apartment. And, um, I couldn\\'t sleep, thinking about it. So, uh, would it be okay if I cleaned it?  No?  Who da wenny-Benny boy? You the Wenny-wenny-Benny-Benny boy, yes. Don\\'t cry. Don\\'t cry. Why is he still crying?  Maye it\\'s me.  He hates me. My nephew hates me.  What if my own baby hates me? Huh? What am I gonna do then?  Uh, I don\\'t know, butter, eggs, flour, lime, kiwi--  No I didn\\'t, I said kiwi lime. That\\'s what makes it so special.  No you\\'re not. You\\'re, you\\'re allergic to lobster and peanuts and--oh my god.  Oh my god.  Is your tongue swelling up?  All right, get your coat, we\\'re going to the hospital.  Yeah, he\\'s just gotta get a shot.  Jacket now.  Doctor, can I see you for just a minute please? My brother has a slight phobia about needles.  My brother, the PhD would like to know if there\\'s any way to treat this orally.  That\\'s good, have a seat. Um, the doctor says it\\'s gotta be a needle. You\\'re just gonna have to be brave, ok? Can you do that for me?  Ok. Oh boy. You are doin\\' so good. You wanna squeeze my hand? All right, Ross, don\\'t squeeze it so hard. Honey, really, don\\'t squeeze it so hard! Oh, Ross! Let go of my hand!  Are you sure he didn\\'t break it because it really hurts.  That\\'s ok. I\\'m sorry I poisoned you.  Remember it? What do you think this is, a freckle?  Wait, what about the time I hit you in the face with the Silvian\\'s pumpkin?  No. But I remember people telling me about it.  Yeah. I hope she can kick his ass.  That was you?  Aw, my little nephew. Come here, little one. There\\'s my little baby Ben. Hey, my little boy. Hey, he\\'s not crying.  She sent the chicken back again?!  Well fine! I want to meet this chicken expert! Send the Colonel in!  I’m fine.  Oh… Uh…  Well, she saw the ring.  Well, she was shocked when I told her, but then again so were most people.  Well, she actually has a boyfriend y’know herself, named Clark. Uh, she also kinda invited herself to our wedding. Clark too.  Huh?  Well, she corned me! She asked if the wedding was in town! I mean, what was I supposed to do?!  Come on! So she comes to the wedding! I mean it won’t be so bad.  Oh my God, she’s not gonna like the chicken that night either is she?!  Really?  So-so you would’ve just lied?  Would it really have been that easy?  Good, so do it Saturday night because we’re going to dinner with her and Clark.  He might still show up.  Is that all?  It’s actually going to be just family.  What are we gonna do?  Janice, what umm, what are you doing here?  Yeah, in-in-in the bathroom.  We’ll just…we’ll just let her stay.  Kinda like your Barca lounger.  I never stop thinking about it.  Oh my God! Oh my God! You have to go!  Because Chandler still has feelings for you!  That’s right. That’s right. And that is why you can’t stay here tonight. And probably why you shouldn’t come to the wedding.  I mean, I realize that his feelings may never completely go away, but you can.  Oh good, another dinosaur story. When are those gonna become extinct?  I was always Joanne.  What’s the part?  Not at these prices.  This is not the bed I ordered!  Phoebe!  Why is this car in my bedroom?  When did I sign for it?  Did you make brownies today?  Joey, you’re this guy’s teacher. I mean how could you do this?  Yeah, I talked to you on the phone, I’m the lady that got stuck with the racecar bed.  Okay.  Guys! I’m not pregnant.  You didn’t tell anybody I was did you?!  Because I’m not.  What are you talking about?  Yeah!  Why?!  Phoebe, come on, you have to tell us.  Honey, I’m going to put my hand in your pocket!  No.  What?!  Oh that is so sweet!  Yes.  What’s the matter?  Well, are you going to be able to do this?  Well, the good news is, I don’t think anyone’s looking at us.  Can you believe Phoebe got pregnant?!  This is so huge.  Of course not nothing is. Between me and you…  …in this day and age how dumb do you have to be to get pregnant?  How?  Well I-I talked to and uh, she’s definitely going to have this baby. Y’know, she said she was gonna raise it on her own.  Maybe. I just hope she realizes how hard it’s gonna be.  Well, there’s a lot to think about. I mean, how is she, how is she going to handle this financially? How is she going to juggle work? Does she realize she’s not going to have a date again for the next eighteen years?  Are you okay?  Oh really?!  How do you feel?  Yes! Maybe it’s a false positive. Are you sure you peed on the stick right?  You-you gotta take it now. Come on, do it as a present to me.  Okay.  Oh, wait a minute! Who’s is the father?!  Oh, come on it’s my wedding! That can be my present.  Hey, are you ready to get back on the dance floor?  Go ahead Rach.  Well… Well, great.  Oh God…  Are you really gonna do this?  Wow, you’re really crazy about her, huh?  Yes!! Yes! Yeah, yeah, yeah!  I get the dollhouse!  Y\\'know what, you can play with my dollhouse.  Any time you want. Y\\'know, when I was younger, all I wanted to do was to play with this dollhouse, but no!! It was to be looked at, but never played with.  Look at it! Ohhh! Wallpaper’s a little faded, that’s okay. Carpet’s a little loose. Hardwood floors!!  I know!!!  Okay.  What’s this?  Not one that can pee on the roof.  I don’t want a ghost.  Okay, Phoebe, y\\'know what? That-that’s it, that’s it, all right? No dinosaurs, no ghosts, no giant dogs, okay? They’re not the right size, they’re not Victorian, and they just don’t go.  It’s very interesting, Phoebe.  Hey, guys, guys, did you see my new, china cabinet?!  You’re kidding?! That’s great!  Oh my.  Come on Rach, when a guy says he’s going to call, it doesn’t mean he’s going to call. Hasn’t it ever happened to you?  Hmm, bite me.  Oh, that’s okay. By the way, I was just checking the shower massager.  Well, the giraffe’s okay. And so is the pirate.  Hey.  A mirror?  Wow, for a guy who\\'s recently lost his job, you\\'re in an awfully good mood.  Cache? Jaunty?  Hey.  Oh my God, it was incredible.  Rachel you have to read this book. It\\'s called Be Your Own Windkeeper. It\\'s about how women need to become more empowered.  It is nothing like the Hobbit. It\\'s like reading about every relationship I\\'ve ever had, except for Richard.  No.  Yes. But all the other ones.  Isn\\'t it.  Hey.  You go girl. I can\\'t pull that off can I?  Aaahhhhhhh! Aaahhhh!  I wa-  And I would have to say pah-huh.  Do you not remember the puppet guy?  And his puppet too.  Who?  Oh.  Woah, woah, woah, let\\'s go back to 29.  Huuh, alright, Danny Arshak, ninth grade. Oh, c\\'mon Rach, you know the bottle was totally pointing at me.  One hour? You are such a leaf blower.  We didn\\'t order cake.  You\\'re right.  We\\'re good.  Are you sure this time?  There is no alley behind Macy\\'s.  So on this road trip, did you guys win any money?  Nice.  I did.  Okay, I-I d\\'know, you-you just- you have a quality.  Hello? Hello? Oh! Rachel, it\\'s Paolo calling from Rome.  How-how are you, Mom?  What?  Nothing.  She is unbelievable, our mother is...  Oh God!  The fuzzy little mints at the bottom of her purse.  I know.  Ross!  We checked. A lot.  Dad!  You what?  Define fun.  ...And then we throw your body in the water... Gee, that does sound fun.  That\\'s probably what they\\'ll say.  Mom already called this morning to remind me not to wear my hair up. Did you know my ears are not my best feature?  Are these the shoes?  It was a really beautiful service.  Wow, those pills really worked, huh?  Well, sure, what with it being her funeral and all.  That sounds like Nana.  ...I can imagine.  That is a wonder. So tell me something, Mom. If you had to do it all over again, I mean, if she was here right now, would you tell her?  How she drove you crazy, picking on every little detail, like your hair... for example.  Do you think things would have been better if you\\'d just told her the truth?  Huh.  Oh, I think so.  Thank you. They\\'re yours.  Let\\'s see, 1939... yeah, 24, 25?  Pete\\'s breaking up with me.  I just checked my messages, and he said that when he gets back from Atlanta, we need to talk.  Well that\\'s it. People never say `We need to talk\\' unless it\\'s something bad.  Really?!  Yeah. Which one do you like more?  No-no-no, that\\'s a video-phone. But hey guys you\\'re not supposed to be here, so please, do not touch anything.  I know.  I guess that\\'s how.  Oh it’s umm, good! It\\'s umm, it’s good, just here watering the plants.  Ahh, Pete, the other day when you said you needed to talk, umm, just so I know, is it good news or bad news.  Oh no-no-no, it\\'s still me.  Oh, oh, okay umm, so I\\'ll see you soon.  I love you.  Okay. Well, it\\'s good news. It\\'s good news.  Oh my.  And that\\'s Pete\\'s Mom.  Would you stop? We’ve only been going out a couple of weeks, I mean we don’t even know if he’s gonna propose.  Well if-if that’s what it is, then it’s-it’s crazy.  Y\\'know when girls sleep with guys with weird things on their body, they tell their friends about it.  Brides magazines?  So then, are you going to dump Jason?  Ooh, nice.  Oh, right! I completely forgot about that.  Yeah?  Wow.  What’s that?  You wanna what?!  What are you talking about?  And I suppose you used a ring designer for that.  My parents will be so happy.  YOU BET YOUR ASS I AM! I just had the best first day ever! The kitchen: twice as big as Allessandro\\'s.  Yeah, a-a-and clean. Not just health department clean... Monica clean.  Maybe he didn\\'t give you a chance.  Oh, well... That had been your window.  Really? The scientist guy?  Continue...  Phoebe!  Wow, isn\\'t it ironic that David would show up on the same day that you and Mike exchange keys?  What are you gonna do?  You have to tell David!  Heeeeeey!  No, it just remind me of something this guy did today at work. I told you about that funny guy, Geoffrey, right?  Hi! There you are.  Yeah! I think that\\'s great!  Oh... How are they?  Yes... What is the end of that sentence?  Yeah, so?  Is that why he\\'s acting so weird...? He\\'s jealous...? Oh my God, that is crazy. It\\'s not like I\\'m attracted to Geoffrey...  I can\\'t believe he\\'s that upset about this...  Ohhh, ooohhh... you are on a roll, mister!  Honey, listen... You have nothing to worry about with Geoffrey.  Well, you\\'re... you\\'re different funny... I mean, you\\'re... you\\'re more sarcastic a-a-and... well, he does... bits... and impressions... and... and limericks...  Honey, you can relax. Last night at work, Geoffrey told this really sexist joke. After that, not so funny anymore.  Okay, don\\'t miss that flight. You know I love you.  Naaaa... He still kills me. Last night he had me laughing so hard, I swear... a little pee came out.  I can\\'t believe you guys are actually getting tattoos.  Ross, come sign this birthday card for dad. Rich is gonna be here any minute.  Well, he\\'s my parents\\' best friend, he has to be there.  Yeah. It\\'s my dad\\'s birthday, I decided to give him a stroke.  No, I don\\'t even know how serious he is about me. Until I do, I\\'m not telling them anything.  OK, wait, wait, wait, wait. You know what? Ross, let\\'s - let\\'s switch places. You get in the middle. No un-, ya know, unless this looks like we\\'re trying to cover something up.  Happy birthday dad.  Finger cramp. Oh God, sorry. Here, let me get that mom.  Are we still on that?  I\\'m a twinkie.  Oh, this is so hard.  Maybe we should just tell your parents first.  God, you are so lucky. I mean, I mean. . . you know what I mean.  Alright.  You remember that video I found of mom and dad?  Well, I just caught the live show.  Hey there.  Nothing, I just heard something nice about you.  Well, actually, I\\'m already seeing someone.  Well, uh, he\\'s a doctor.  Mom, it\\'s OK.  Dad, I\\'m the twinkie.  Al-alright, l-look you guys, this is the best relationship I\\'ve been in. . .  Yes, a relationship. For your information I am crazy about this man.  Yes.  Dad, dad this is a good thing for me. Ya know, and you even said yourself, you\\'ve never seen Richard happier.  Upstairs in the bathroom right before you felt up mom.  So, are you sorry that I told them?  Oh. Well did you get it? Let me see.  No he went out to get pizza.  That\\'s great.  Yes.  I know, how can you not be accross the hall anymore.  Danny? You know Rachel? She’s nice. She’s not bad to look at, right?  Do you want to go out on a date with her?  Friday’s perfect...She can’t wait.  I just wanted to see how it\\'s going.  Yeah!  Hey, what\\'s up?  Oh, honey, I\\'m sorry.  You had no relationship!!  Oh God, stop with the plan! So what, so what you saw him with a girl? Who cares?! That doesn\\'t mean anything! Now look, you\\'re going to go out on a date with Danny and you\\'re going to be so charming he\\'s gonna forget all about that stupid subway girl.  Come on, hurry!  No.  No.  Yeah, good for you. Y\\'know you\\'re tough, you lived on the streets.  Hey!  All the time. In fact, I was undefeated.  Still, I was quick as a cat.  Oh, you\\'re kidding.  Too strong for me?  You wanna go right now? \\'Cause I\\'ll take you right now, buddy! You wanna go?  That was unbelievable!  Hi, how are you doing Kelly?  It\\'s my new perfume. Why don\\'t you come closer where you can really appreciate it?  This is disgusting!  Hey!  Sure, we\\'ll do that. What are you up to?  Oh my god.  Just figured, \\'cause you and Ross are...  You want a job? Turn off \"Oprah,\" and send out a resume!  Oh, it\\'s perfect.  Okay, just so you know, I\\'m gonna be ovulating from tomorrow until the sixth, so don\\'t touch yourself in the next 48 hours.  Yeah.  No, it\\'s not.  Oh my god. Today\\'s the sixth?! I may be done ovulating! I may have also served some very questionable meat at the restaurant.  Okay.  Hey, where are all my ovulation-sticks? There\\'s only one here.  Chandler!  We\\'re okay. I\\'m still ovulating.  So, let\\'s do this.  Come on. I know you\\'re not eighteen anymore, but give it a minute.  Oh my god, Emma. Oh, sweetie, I forgot you were here. Oh, you\\'re right, we can\\'t do this. We can\\'t leave her alone.  Unless... Maybe we do it here. I mean, how much can she even be aware of at this age?  Canoodling?  I don\\'t know. I mean, I guess having sex in front of a baby isn\\'t so...  I guess you\\'re right.  But what kind of a sick bastard wants to do it in front of a deer?  She\\'s asleep. Chandler?  What are you doing?  She\\'s asleep.  Yes, but we have to be fast.  Well, that was weird. You were loud, and I was fast.  Oh, I wish I didn\\'t have to wait to take a pregnancy test.  Oh my god, where\\'s Emma? Where\\'s Emma?  Okay, okay, I\\'m sure that Rachel came home early and picked up Emma. You go look across the hall, and I\\'ll call her cell.  Hey, you better hope that we\\'re pregnant, because one way or another, we\\'re giving a baby back to Rachel.  Hey, did you stop by here?  Oh my god, then...  Oh, thank god! Emma, there you are!  Oh, we were playing \"peek-a-boo.\" She just � she loves it when I\\'m dramatic.  No, we weren\\'t!  No, please don\\'t. Please, Joey. She will kill us!  Unless what?  It sounds interesting!  Yeah.  No, I don\\'t think it ever works. Why?  No, no, Rachel?  Who do you wanna fool around with?  In the hall.  You wanna fool around with Joey?  Who? Who do you know that are friends that just fool around?  Who, who are they?  Both of them?  Which one?  Rachel, things can get incredibly complicated.  What the hell are you cooking!  Hey!  What\\'s so bad about that?  Hey, Rachel, Can-can I see you for a sec?  You\\'re not sick!  You just wanna stay home so you can make a move on Joey!  Ok, what is this?  Joey is having a secret Days Of Our Lives party up on the roof!  The game\\'s over! Take off your robe!  Oh my God! Kyle Lowder!  Oh yeah that\\'s what you want - my inhibitions lowered.  Oh man! If I had known I was coming to this party I never would have gotten married!  I guess you have forgotten all about Joey?  Don\\'t worry Joe, I won\\'t come next year!  Oh my god, honey, I\\'m so so so so so sorry.  You really liked it?  Oh really!  No!  So I got it when I was 13...  Hey!  No, you can\\'t! Friends hooking up is a bad idea.  That\\'s different! I was drunk and stupid!  What about all the guys that you\\'ve got the phone numbers from? Why don\\'t you just kiss one of them?  And I can\\'t stop you.  Oh, you\\'re so wonderful.  You don\\'t know military time?  Just subtract twelve.  Please... honey, leave the details to me. Now I wanna make this day as special for you as I can. Now, ok, I was thinking that the harpist should wear white.  Ooh... she backed out.  Yeah, I changed them. I-I sent you a fax about it!  Ah, well then there are gonna be a few surprises!  What?  Hi. About last night... I know you are under a lot of stress and even though the things you said hurt me a little bit... My point is, uh, well, I\\'m willing to take my job back.  Uh-huh, but I\\'m sure you can handle this. I mean, I have won awards for my organizational skills, but, uh, I\\'m sure you\\'ll do fine.  Mm-mh. I printed them out on my computer.  Hi.  She\\'s in her room, why?  I know.  Bye.  What?  You really want me to come back?  Ooh! But the band and the photographer are coming all the way in from New Jersey!  Level 1 alert. I repeat, level 1. This is not a drill. Okay we\\'ve got a situation. The minister just called. He\\'s snowed in. He can\\'t make it.  Really?  Okay, if Joey does the ceremony, then we have to find someone else to walk Phoebe down the isle.  Okay, Joey\\'s doing the ceremony and Chandler\\'s giving you away.  So, you\\'re ready to do this?  Okay Marjorie, hit it.  Tell him.  Just...please tell him.  Look at you, you won\\'t even look at him.  Is it like for dinosaur emergencies. \\'Help, come quick, they\\'re still extinct.\\'  Thank you.  He\\'s... our age.  Okay, he\\'s a senior in college.  No, of course not. It\\'s not even an issue. Cause I told him I was 22.  Oh, I can\\'t pass for 22?  I am 26.  What?  I don\\'t know. Look he\\'s a great guy and I love being with him but... you know. Things happen, and they happen. You don\\'t plan these things.  Yeah.  Did not.  How was that possible?  Okay.  Unless...  Uh, ah. Unless you wanna stay over? I mean, I\\'m going to, so...  Okay, is this like \\'I have an early class tomorrow\\' or \\'I\\'m secretly married to a goat?\\'  Ethan?  Are you a virgin?  Really?  You keep saying that.  Listen, uh, you told me something that was really difficult for you. And I, I-I figured if you could be honest, then I can to.  No-no. Nothing wrong about that.  Um, okay, here it goes. I\\'m not 22. I\\'m, I\\'m 25... and thirteen months.  But I figured, you know, that shouldn\\'t change anything. I mean, what the hell does it matter how old we are.  You\\'re not a senior?  Ok...ay.  What we did was wrong. Oh god, I just had sex with somebody that wasn\\'t alive during the Bicentennial.  Ethan, focus. How could you not tell me?  Well, that\\'s different. My lie didn\\'t make one of us a felon in 48 states. What were you thinking?  Really?  Well,fall out of it. You know, you shouldn\\'t even be here, it\\'s a school night. Oh god, oh god. I\\'m like those women that you see with shiny guys named Chad. I\\'m Joan Collins.  What?  Oh.  No. You know, sometimes just things doesn\\'t work out.  Ha,ha, ha, oh my life is just so amusing. Could we drop it now?  Aren\\'t you gonna...  That was gonna be my opener.  It was.  Ethan, it\\'s um... it\\'s icky.  This isn\\'t easy for me either. I wish things were different, I... If you were a few years older, or if I was a few years younger, or if we lived in biblical times, I would really...  ...love you.  I can\\'t belive it, I\\'m gonna be an aunt. I\\'m gonna have like a nephew.  No, but he told me, he thinks your a fox.  So, Chandler, who’s on your list?  First, I need a boyfriend, then I can have a list.  Hey! Where ‘ya headin’ in those pants? 1982?  Why, what’s wrong with my bathroom floor?  I can’t live like this! What are we gonna do? What are we gonna do?  That’s a little more than I wanted to see.  I can’t leave it! You gouged a hole in my dingy floor.  You know that’s nice, y\\'know we could put it back there after the surgeons remove it from your colon!  What kind of karate is that?  So how’s it going with you guys?  Oh, we used to drive each other crazy playing the shadow game.  Oh, how do you play the shadow game?  I just asked you.  No, that is what the game is.  What’s the matter?  Ah-ah-ah, now you started this, you will finish it.  And who laminated it?  Why? ‘Cause otherwise you’d go for it?  Rach, are you really gonna let him do this?  Oh, actually this year we just made him homemade cookies.  Money is so impersonal. Cookies says someone really cares. . . Alright, we\\'re broke, but cookies do say that.  Oh, and the newspaper delivery guy.  Oh look, and he did my crossword puzzle.  Cute.  Ross, that is gorgeous!  Look at these authentic fake medals. I tell ya, mom\\'s gonna be voted best dressed at the make-believe military academy.  Honey, uh, this is a picture of the frame guy posing in front of a bright blue screen with a collie.  Oh, wait a minute honey.  Wow.  Hi.  I hope she\\'s OK.  How do you know exactly what she\\'s going through?  Just some stuff for the party.  You guys haven\\'t gotten your presents yet? Tomorrow\\'s Christmas Eve, what\\'re ya gonna do?  Well, maybe the mailman liked the cookies, we just didn\\'t give him enough.  For the sixteenth time, no... I do not think you\\'re obsessive.  Ross, the heat!  Well put it back.  Here, let me try.  Hey, it\\'s Funny\\'s cousin, Not Funny.  No, if he doesn\\'t like our cookies, too bad, I am not gonna be blackmailed. Look if worse comes to worse, it gets a little warm, we\\'ll call it a theme party.  No, I will not cave.  Ross.  Whatever.  So, wait, you really did like my cookies?  Hey, we could have used that kind of thinkin\\' earlier.  Honey, I\\'m sorry.  Hello?  Really?� But tomorrow night is the only night I get off from the restaurant.� If you go to the game, we won\\'t have a night together for another week.  Chandler look, I don\\'t want to be one of those wives who says, \"You can\\'t go to the game.� You have to spend time with me.\"� So, if you could just realize it on your own . . .  Tell him that you haven\\'t seen your wife in a long time.� Tell him that having a long-distance relationship is really difficult.� Tell him that what little time we have is precious.  Hi.  Welcome home.  Yeah.� What do you think?  Oh.  Just a second.  Why not?  So, you lied to him?  Oh, because, um . . .� well, Chandler\\'s going to be home in a couple of days.� So, I thought I would, you know, practice the art of seduction.  Because. . .� one of them is for you.  You might want to keep practicing.  Chandler, you have to tell Joey that you\\'re not in Tulsa.  I don\\'t want him to think that I\\'m having an affair.  Yes, because all good plans start with, \"I\\'ll go down the fire escape.\"  Scary pigeon\\'s back?  What are you saying?  Joey?  I don\\'t know what to say.� We shouldn\\'t have lied to you.  You should go to the game.� It\\'s okay.� I want you to.  Yeah, I\\'ll be fine.� You know, maybe I\\'ll stay here and practice the art of seduction.  Have fun.  No. I think we learned that from the sugarlips incident. I\\'m gonna get some tea.  So it looks like it\\'s going really well for you two, huh?  I think that is so great! When are you gonna ask her?  I swear, I promise. I promise. Oh my God, I\\'m so excited! {And I just can\\'t hide it! I\\'m about to lose control and I think I like it! Sorry, just couldn\\'t resist it.} All right, listen let me tell you, do not get her flowers. Okay? Because y\\'know, she cries when they die, and there\\'s the whole funeral…  He just told me at the counter. He made me promise not to tell, but I couldn\\'t hold it in any longer!  Relax! It\\'s Phoebe! Not you!  Ohhhh!  All right, come on, I\\'m-I\\'m late for work!  Guys, could you please just stop throwing the ball for one minute and just help me find it!  What?!  Really?!  Rach?  I don\\'t want a cat!  He\\'s a dropper!  Oh my—Oh good God!  So, why don\\'t you just take it back to where you got it?  Rach, why won\\'t they take it back?  Look, if you want you can keep it at our place until you find out what to do with it.  So you\\'re moving in with him. What happened?  Why, do you write him a lot?  Come on guys! Suck it up! We\\'re closing in on ten hours! It\\'s gut-check time!  Please! I made this game what it is.  All right, there\\'s some pizza at my place, we can all eat with one hand right? Are you with me?  Rachel! What is your cat doing in one of my bowls!  Wow! You made a profit!  All right! Come on Monica! Look alive! Come on, look alive!  It\\'s okay. It\\'s okay. Just pretend that it didn\\'t happen! Okay? No one needs to know! I mean, Phoebe\\'s not an official ballplayer! I mean, only official ballplayers can drop the ball!  Besides, if anybody\\'s gonna get free stuff, it\\'s gonna be me.  I think it\\'s a great idea. Yeah, we could have a dinner party and just invite her close friends.  I would love to do it together!  It\\'s gonna be weird to watch some actor pretending to be Ben\\'s dad.  That doesn\\'t seem fair.  Rachel, you can go down there, you don\\'t have to smoke. Just say you wanna get some fresh air.  Hey!  All right, that\\'s a little sketch of the cake, umm some sample menus, umm y\\'know what I thought we would start out with Tuscan style finger food, and for music, here\\'s an alphabetized list of all my CDs! I\\'ve highlighted the ones that would go really good with the food.  Oh, we\\'re not doing that. Okay…  What?! I didn\\'t take care of everything, there\\'s-there\\'s plenty of things for you to do!  And ice!  Wait a minute, I can get ice at the restaurant…  Hey! How\\'d the audition go?!  You got a callback too didn\\'t you?  You stink!  No, I\\'m-I\\'m serious!  That\\'s so gross!  Chandler! Everyone--no one\\'s eating my Tuscan finger food \\'cause they\\'re all filling up on Phoebe\\'s snow cones!  That\\'s the surprise!  All right, umm, we’re not gonna really keep it this way though.  Well, I’m gonna fill in for him as food critic for the Chelsea Reporter.  Wow, Monica! What an amazing opportunity to influence… dozens of people.  Oh no-no-no, it’s only one night a week, and plus I get to take all of you out for a lot of free dinners.  Oh.  All right, were you guys smoking something in the back of our van?  Hey! My first review is out!  All right, look at my on the back page.  Hey, they don’t pay me a penny a word to make friends.  Oh! Do you need me to go with you?  Haven’t we made this decision?  Bye!  Oh my God.  Look, I-I’m never gonna let you up so you may as well just go away.  No! Phoebe!  I couldn’t eat it! I had five friends who couldn’t eat it, and one of them eats books.  The waiter carried the breadsticks in his pants!  All right, that I’ll retract. But I stand by my review, I know food and that wasn’t it. You’re marinara sauce tasted like tomato juice! You should serve it with vodka and a piece of celery.  Oh my God! You own an Italian restaurant and you think that tastes good?! Where are you even from?  Hand me those tomatoes, I’m gonna show you what it should taste like! Come on, hand me them.  Okay, the owner of Allesandro’s came over to yell at me, but instead I made him some sauce, and he offered me the job as head chef!!  Can you believe it? I finally get to run my own kitchen!  You got the job?! Why didn’t you tell me?  I know, but now we have this second one and it just, it feels like it’s snowballing, y’know?  I got offered the head chef job at Allesandro’s.  It’s okay, ‘cause y\\'know what? You don’t really need me for the business.  All right. But umm, I-I-I’ll pay you back all the money you invested, and you can keep the van.  I’ve been doing a lot of thinking. A lot! And umm, well, I came up with a whole bunch of businesses you can do with your van. Okay umm, you could be flower delivery person.  Or! A bakery delivery person.  Pizza?!  All right, I’ve got a whole bunch of uh-uh, stuff in this area, but umm, I’m getting the feeling that you don’t want to deliver.  Okay. I’m guessing that if you don’t want to deliver, you probably don’t want to pick stuff up either.  Y’know what, let’s do the catering business.  Yeah, y\\'know I-I made a commitment to you. Y’know what, it’d be, it’d be fun.  Really?!  Thank you.  Hey!  Three down knows I’m married, what’s three down doin’?  Joey! You’re doing great!  You slept with her didn’t you?  What?!  Sorry.  Hey, what\\'s that?  What is that?  So basically, this is a getting-rid-of-everything-Rachel-ever-used sale.  Now calm down Joey.  Look, I\\'m not happy about this either, but y\\'know if-if Ross says he\\'s happy then we\\'re just gonna have to keep our feelings about Emily to ourselves. Are you cool with that?  Rachel, if you want the little round waffles, you gotta have to wait until I find the little waffle iron.  Oh my God! Fog him! Fog him!  We were, we were just in the storage area and we saw this really creepy man!  And he came at us with an axe, so Rachel had to use a bug bomb on him!  Oh he\\'s nice. He\\'s nice! Y\\'know, you always stick up for the people we fog!  We\\'re-we\\'re really sorry we fogged you.  Yeah.  Wow! That guy is so rude!  Well you did a little bit.  I totally forgive you!  Yes!  Hey!  Crematorium Chris? Sure!  Don\\'t get too attached, she\\'s having it cremated.  No, Ross, we do not hate Emily. We-we just, we just think that you\\'re having to sacrifice a whole lot to make her happy.  God, I feel so guilty about Ross.  Whatever you decide, whatever you do.  Why don\\'t you come over tonight? And I\\'ll make you favorite dinner.  Hey, look at you! Where have you been?  How did that happen?  I hope you\\'re not full, \\'cause dinner\\'s almost ready.  Wow, this is so weird. I just realized this might be the last time we\\'ll all be hanging out together.  How can you tell? You can only see the back of his head!  Oh, sweetie. Oh, look at you. You\\'re shivering.  Oh my God!  Oh well, maybe we can put it in the guest bedroom.  Are you kidding?! I practically spent my entire childhood at the arcade! This is like—Oh my, this is like my second favorite game!  Well I-I really don’t remember the name of it.  Well, you just—you put a quarter in and y’know pull-pull some handles and win like a candy bar or something.  Don’t feel bad for me! I won like every time!  Chandler! Phoebe’s hogging the game!  You only think it’s stupid because you suck at it.  No! No-no! I love it! It is a great present! In fact, why don’t you go home and wait for the thank you card?  Hey.  Well it clearly wasn’t showering or shaving.  Wait a minute, you stayed home all day and played Ms. Pac-Man while I went off to work like some kind of chump?!  What is the matter with your hand?  Chandler, why would you do that?  You think this is clever?  Hey wait a minute, this one isn’t dirty.  Ah, well if you don’t clear this off, you won’t be getting one of those from me. But Ben’s coming over here tomorrow to play this game, this can’t be there.  Chandler! He’s seven; he’s not stupid.  All right, look I’m just gonna unplug it.  Honey you-you got to beat your scores!  All right fine. Fine, I’ll do it. I’ve just got to get this off the screen. Carol and Susan are still upset that you taught him pull my finger.  They’re all Chandler.  But Ben is coming over tonight and he can’t see this.  Oh my God Phoebe, you’re on fire!  Don’t touch her!!  What about the rest of Manhattan?!  Oh my God, this is horrible!  I’m so humiliated!  Is he right? Am I really—Am I awful?  We said at the movies, but…  Hey Joey, come taste this.  No. He teaches a course on food criticism at the New School, so before we go to the movies I wanna go by there and make him try my bouillabaisse again. Oh, I cannot wait to read the front page of the Post tomorrow! \"Restaurant reviewer admits: I was wrong about Monica.\"  Hi! Umm, I’m Monica Geller, I’m the chef at Alessandro’s.  I think the things that you said about me are really unfair, and I would like for you to give my bouillabaisse another chance.  I can.  Well umm, they both have a egg yolk and butter base, but a bearnaise has shallots, shirvel, and most importantly tarragon.  Monica.  Oh no! I don’t know anything about cooking. I had to ask someone what it’s called when the, when the water makes those little bubbles.  I-I-I’m sorry, your-your mouth was full, I didn’t hear what you said. Umm, hats off to who now?  That’s right.  Joey! I’m so proud of you!  Excuse me? He doesn’t even know what he’s doing!  I’m-I’m sorry, it’s just that umm… Well I-I cook at this restaurant, Alessandro’s, and umm I just got a really bad review…  You do?  Oh, I’m totally crazy, but you-you like the food?  Oh, look! Acting for Beginners! Want to feel good about yourself?  Okay.  Well, because every time we do, you make jokes about swinging and scare them away.  Ross, we\\'re kind of in the middle of diner here.  No one wanted seconds, right?  I don\\'t know who I\\'m happiest for...  Uhm the... the ministry... of names... bureau...  I\\'m sorry. It\\'s just the idea of being an official Bing.  All right. I know you\\'re not happy about us moving, but you\\'re the only one who hasn\\'t seen the house.  Joey, please come. It would mean so much to us.  See you guys later.  Hey Pheebs.  Oh, I\\'m sorry, mrs Hannigan.  Phoebe!  You seriously changed your name to that?  Okay, so from now on we have to call you Princess Consuela?  Oh God. I\\'m so sorry.  But more importantly to full well-rounded lives.  Thank you for letting us see the house again.  Ah, so glad you decided to come.  No it\\'s not. We had an inspection and they didn\\'t find anything.  Maybe because it\\'s you hung your head out of the window like a dog the whole ride here.  No it\\'s not!  Oh Joey, look, we know you\\'re having a hard time with this, but we really, we love it here.  Joey, we know that\\'s you.  Oh, I love this street. The trees, the big front yards, the actual picket fences.  Hey, where have you been?  Joey, now that you\\'re okay with the house, do you wanna go see your room?  No.  I guess. Why? Who\\'s she with?  So what if he wants to sleep with her? I mean, she\\'s single and he\\'s cute.  Oh please! Yesterday on the subway? You couldn\\'t stop staring at that woman with the big breasts the whole time.  Oh, sorry!  Are you gonna dress up as Santa?  No.  About a half an hour.  No.  Bing\\'s weird.  Hey!  Ahh, Phoebe, I\\'m gonna miss you!  Phoebe, don\\'t worry about it. I\\'m sure she wants to live with you.  Well, no. But, um, I bet she probably does.  I\\'m sorry. But not that sorry, \\'cause you don\\'t have to live with it. Um, we have a reservation under the name Chandler Bing.  No, to get a table! Places like are always shakin’ you down. Everybody wants to be paid off.  You\\'ve got to be smooth about it.  How did it go?  It\\'s easy! Just keep it casual! Give him a kind word, shake his hand and give him the money!  I don\\'t know.  We\\'d be eating our soup right now.  It\\'s not just the drum noise. Every five minutes, Joey throws his sticks in the air, and I have to hear, \"Oh my eye! Oh god, my eye!\" I mean, it is so annoying.  Phoebe, you got Joey drums to annoy Rachel, so she wouldn\\'t wanna live there anymore?  What happened to Santa, Holiday Armadillo?  Wow, come in, have a seat. You must be exhausted coming all the way from…Texas.  Because Armadillos also wandered in the desert?  Come on Ben.  Okay Ben, why don\\'t you come open some more presents, and Santa, the Armadillo, and I have a little talk in the kitchen? There\\'s a sentence, I never thought I\\'d say.  Yes, is that okay?  No.  Please, I\\'m not going for anything.  Would you please go?  Look Julio, someone left their book here.  Oh yeah, what are you reading?  It was soo amazing, he is so sexy, and smart, which makes him even sexier. Oh gosh, I gotta so you this. Last night, we were fooling around and he stops to write a poem.  Oh good, I think so too. Pheebs?  All right, just give it back to me when your done. See you guys.  Hey.  Oh-ho, look what I got Julio.  Yeah, just like the one in the poem.  What do you mean?  Y\\'know, so I don\\'t read as many important books as you do, and I don\\'t write trick poems that seem to be about one thing but are actually about something else. And y\\'know what, I get excited about stupid stuff, like when I my People magazine comes on Saturday, and the new Hold Everything catalog. Y\\'know but that does not mean that I\\'m empty, I care about things. I care about my friends and family. You have no right to make that kind of judgment about me.  You don\\'t even know me...  What?  I\\'m sorry, my friend Phoebe...  I just told my Mom I’d cater a party for her.  Because I need the money, and I thought that it’d be a great way to get rid of that last little schmidgen of self-respect.  You don’t have to stick up for her. She can’t here you.  Doing great, the quiches are coming along.  Yeah, I thought it was cute.  Let me ask you a question.  Why did you hire me?  Oh yeah, she didn’t hire me out of pity, it wasn’t so she could pick on me in front of her friends, she actually thinks I’m good.  What?  Oh, I know, I never wear fake ones. I just did it so my Mom wouldn’t give me grief about me biting them.  Okay ah, please don’t freak out. Umm, but ah, there’s a blue fingernail in one of the quiche cups, and there’s no way to know which one.  Then why are you laughing?  What? You bet I’d lose a nail?  Frozen lasagnas?  You bet that I’d screw up?! So all that stuff about hiring me because I was good was…  You promised Dr. Weinburg, you’d never use that phrase.  Hi.  Ohh, I’m such an idiot. I can’t believe I actually thought she could change.  Oh good, I’m glad that’s catching on.  What?  Well?  Really?!  Yes!!  And you?  So if everyone liked it, and you liked it, that would make this a success. Which would make you…  Well, I was going for wrong, but we can use your word.  Wow!  That really means a lot. Oh, and Mom, don’t bite your nails.  Why are you talking about volcanoes all of the sudden?  What are you doing?!  I\\'m so sorry that you had to find out this way. I\\'m sorry, but it\\'s true, I love him too.  Guys, you\\'re a few steps ahead of us.  But what?  In that cute, little, sweet way she just did?  I know what you need, you need a bodyguard. Hey Ross, what is Ben doing after preschool?  Isn\\'t this great?  Are you okay?  What-what are you doing?  Man, I knew it! I knew you were going to do this!!  Get all freaked out because everybody was talking and just joking around about marriage and stuff.  Oh and you know what I want!  I do not have baby fever!  Have you lost your mind? Chandler, this isn\\'t about me! This is about you and all your weird relationship commitment crap!  I\\'m still not done not wanting to talk to you.  What?!  Okay.  Wait what-wh-wh-what are you doing?!  No-no, don\\'t-don\\'t-don\\'t do it!  Chandler, why are you doing this?  Chandler.  Do you umm, you really think the best reason to get married is because you\\'re sorry?  Honey! Do you know that none of that stuff came from me?! I mean I never said I wanted to have babies and get married right now!  Who? Two divorces and Joey?!  Y\\'know what? Y\\'know when I said that I want you to deal with this relationship stuff all on your own? Well, you\\'re not ready for that.  Oh my God, what would have done if I said yes?  Well I think the length of teasing is directly related to how insane you were so, a long time.  And it has to go perfectly, because if she doesn\\'t like something about us she can keep us off every adoption list in the state.  Ok, so I think I\\'m just about done here, unless you have any bad stuff hidden somewhere, like... porn or cigarettes?  Chandler?  Ok, so there\\'s not a magazine under the couch, or a pack of cigarettes taped to the back of the toilet tank, or a filthy video in the VCR?  It isn\\'t mine!  Oh my God, the adoption lady is early!  Ok.  I told you! I am not coming to a naked wedding!  That’s right. You’re making a commitment and that’s the same, whether you do that at the Plaza or, where are you gonna do it?  Yay!  Why not! This is her wedding day, this is way more important than some stupid kids!  Hi, I am Monica and this is Chandler. Please come in.  Would you like something to drink?  Ok. Great. I am so glad that you are here. We’re really excited about getting this process started.  Ah, thank you. This building does have a wholesome family feel to it.  Is that that couple on the first floor? Because we should get a baby before  Really? What is it?  Ohh... that wouldn\\'t by any chance be... Joey Tribbiani?  Keep on roaming Bert! We don\\'t want any crazy today!  Oh, by the way, you are more than welcome to look under any of the furniture,  So that was the baby\\'s room. (They come out and Chandler throws Joey behind  Yeah, that we totally understand. Dating is hard.  It was Laura... She gave us a great report and we are officially on the waiting list.  Now we just have to wait for a call and... and someone tells us there\\'s a baby waiting for us. Oh...   What?   Yes.   Alright, well I\\'m tearing the lettuce.   Oh-oh, no no don\\'t worry, I\\'m gonna wash it.   That\\'s your call.   Well, I thought that I would cut up the tomatos.   They\\'r alright.   No really, they\\'re OK.   Actually, I was gonna do them jullienne.   Well, what happened?   Was it...  We’re supposed to meet my parents in 15 minutes.  Wh?! What about my allergies?!  You had no right to go out with him.  You sold me out.  Yes you did.  You absolutely sold me...  Did you just flick me?  Fine!  Art it is.  Joey, promise me something.  Never call me from that phone.  Damnit Ross, get your butt out of the bathroom.  Blow drying what, you have no hair.  Your boyfriend has been in there for over an hour. I can\\'t believe it, it\\'s like I\\'m living with him again. He\\'s here when I go to sleep, he\\'s here when I wake up, he\\'s here when I want to use the shower, ughh. It\\'s like I\\'m sixteen all over again .  GET OUT YOU DUFUS!!  I hope you cleaned your hair out of the drain.  Shut up.  Cut it out.  But I thought you wanted to live by yourself.  I promise you, he would definitely want you back.  I was.  Did she leave a number?  I don\\'t have her number, butt-munch.  I\\'m not a baby, you\\'re the baby.  You wanna get out of my face?  Give me that.  I can\\'t believe he has a new roommate. Who is this guy?  I wanna watch Entertainment Tonight.  It\\'s my TV.  Bite me.  Oh that\\'s great, why don\\'t you tell mommy on me.  OK, what\\'re we gonna do about this?  Not that, this, US. Oh my God, Ross, you-re, you\\'re, it\\'s jus-, you-, ever sin- you been here.  I just can\\'t stand you being here all the time.  Fun? Fun, you think this is fun?  Ross, I hated you when we were kids.  Yes. I hated you. I mean I, I, loved you in a \\'you\\'re my brother so I have to\\' kind of way, but basically, yeah, I hated your guts.  Because, you were mean to me and you, you teased me and you always, always got your way.  Duh-huh!  Now I love you. And not just \\'cause I have to.  Yeah. You\\'re just gonna have to stop pissing me off.  Then I won\\'t have to kill you.  Yeah, thanks. You know what?  If you really want to watch that Serengetti thing, you can.  So what\\'re you gonna do?  Sure.  Joey.  Hey.  Oh no, was I cleaning in my sleep again?  Well then who?  Oh, relinquish is just a fancy word for lose!  Did she really say that?  Well, usually when I’m this anxious, I clean!  Oh well umm, I make it myself! It’s two parts ammonia and one part lemon juice. And now the secret ingredient is…y’know what? We just met.  She stole my jeans!  I have been looking for them all week and she is wearing them!  Don’t you see? It’s the perfect crime!  I will prove it to you! Okay? About a week ago I was wearing those jeans and I dropped a pen in my lap and it left an ink stain on the crotch. Now when she comes back I will find it and show you that stain!  I guess.  Fine. I’m just glad I didn’t give her my secret ingredient.  Nice jeans!  Oh, I fell asleep.  Oh, will you do the top of the cabinets? That’ll really work up your appetite for lunch.  Hello.  I’m sorry. I’ve never had a maid before, is this not okay?  Hey! Umm, I think Brenda needs a raise.  Because I put my head between her legs.  They’re my pants!  No! I was just getting into position and then everything went dark.  My pink flowered bra! I recognize the strap!  Here’s the plan! Okay? I’m going to leave you get a look at Brenda’s bra!  I would do it but she thinks I’m attracted to her!  Did you not hear where my head was? Come on! Come on we’re a team! We’re in this together!  Do this for me! Come on, I catch you looking at woman’s breasts all the time!  Yes! Absolutely. Okay? Look, you’ll know it’s mine because on the right cup, the lacey part, there’s a very noticeable rip.  No I didn’t!  Oh no! Did you take my bra too?!  The pink one with the flowers?!  Sounds about right.  Hey Rach, the adoption agency needs letters of recommendation and we were wondering if you would write one for us.  Thank you!  Yeah, it\\'s just we don\\'t think of you as really being so much \"with the words\".  Clearly we were wrong.  You know what? Then, Joey, we want you to do it.  Wow! Don\\'t you look nice?!  You guys do that? Chandler won\\'t even have sex in our bathroom!  Hey Joey, I don’t think we can use this.  Oh, well, I bought Chandler a five hundred dollar watch and he wrote me a rap song.  Oh my God, Mike was gonna propose?  Maybe you don\\'t need him to propose to you, maybe you can propose to him!  Thank you.  How about at a game, on the big screen?  What? what? He obviously thinks that\\'s a nice way to be proposed to, plus he\\'d never suspect it!  No, sorry sweety..  You dropped it off?  You hand-wrote it?  Oh my God, oh my God, that letter is gonna go in our file! We\\'re never gonna get a kid. No, we\\'re gonna be one of those old couples that collects orchids or has a lot of birds!  Okay good.  Ugh, we\\'re screwed, aren\\'t we? You know what? Just tell me on the way to the bird store.  What?  Hey, what did you guys do today?  Because there are so many terrible sights in this world.  I\\'m a cool, fun aunt!  So umm, when I was in the shower I was thinking about our first night in London…  Is that the one that speaks English or the one that doesn\\'t?  That was some hot love you gave me! I\\'m gonna go get ready.  That\\'s a great idea! I was saving them for something special.  You gotta go home and get the earrings that you borrowed from me okay? Chandler wants me to wear them tonight.  Great!  It\\'s a diaper commercial.  What\\'s goin\\' on?  It\\'s okay. I don\\'t care. It\\'s uh, it\\'s fine.  It\\'s no big deal, I do it all the time.  Sure! It doesn\\'t mean anything! Just like I know it doesn\\'t mean anything with you!  Chandler, this actually bothers you?  What?  No you didn\\'t.  Yeah, it\\'s good.  Go on, teach me something about men and women.  No way!  Well that\\'s pathetic!  And this goes for all guys?  No! You are not gonna run out and leave her here!  Yeah, what is it?  All right, sweetie that\\'s fine. You didn\\'t do it on purpose.  Yes!  What about these? These look the same?  Not as each other!  Hi!  Yeah.  Ohh, you\\'re about to get a little luckier.  Oh, honey, the earrings…  My boyfriend really does have good taste!  So have you called her yet?  I can\\'t believe my parents are actually pressuring me to find one of you people.  Look look! It\\'s Rachel and Barry. No, don\\'t everybody look at once!  How\\'d it go?  Rachel, what\\'s going on? I mean isn\\'t this the same Barry who you left at the altar?  Okay, how about the fact that he\\'s engaged to another woman, who just happens to be your ex-best friend?  That\\'s what you\\'ve been working on for the past two hours?!  Great, now he\\'s waving back.  What kinda stuff?  Yeah.. uh, but for future reference, that thing in your hand can also be used as a phone.  Y\\'see, this is where you\\'d use that \\'hello\\' word we talked about.  Uh huh.  You had sex in his chair?!... I said that a little too loudly, didn\\'t I?  Brrrrrrr!  Relax. Y\\'know, she may not even know.  Why don\\'t you just take it with you?  Why don\\'t you just call her?  Do you?  Don\\'t you have to pee?  So she\\'s a woman! So what?  Joey!!  The green dress? Really?  You okay?  Really?  Yeah, there you go!  Yeah I am!  That’s right. Get it out of your system while we’re alone.  Oh no, I already packed. The only thing I couldn’t find though was your Speedo.  Hey!  Thank you.  This is so great! And I’m gonna be your baby’s aunt!  Yeah, but I’m the only one related by blood.  Well, what were you gonna say?  Hey! Good luck!  Well I guess there is no harm in telling you now, Rachel and Ross are gonna have a baby.  I didn’t think you could keep it a secret.  They’re kissing let’s just go around them.  I’m in love too! But in an orderly fashion.  Grab my ass!  Hi, sorry. I almost didn’t hear you, because y’know I’m just so in love with my new husband. We’re on our honeymoon.  Oh no, you see we’re on our honeymoon. So umm, can you do your little thing and bump us up to first class?  You see, if we’d gone around them like I said, we—She would’ve given us those tickets. Damnit!  Look at that! Look at that! They’re going into the first class lounge! Do you know what they have in there?  Oh my God! Oranges!  I can’t believe we’re here.  No!! You have been screwing us all day!  Yeah! You already got the first class tickets; you got the lounge! I mean we should get free stuff too! I mean you’re not the only ones on your honeymoon!  Well do something! Get in there!  Yeah! Do that!  Uh-huh, that one!  But why?! Did he get in touch with Emily?  Vomit tux? Who vomited on—y\\'know what, what you up to Joe?  Oh that\\'s great!  What\\'s wrong with PBS?  Ohh, he\\'s really shy. I-I don’t think he\\'s up to meeting everyone yet.  Hey!  That\\'s great!  What?!  Yeah, I\\'m sure your ex-wife will be more than happy to move to another country so you can patch things up with your new wife.  Sure!  Well, y\\'know I-I-I think I\\'m gonna respect the privacy of my new secret boyfriend.  Great!  What?! You can\\'t—what did you tell her?  Yeah! But, he can\\'t not exactly see Emily, I mean that\\'s his wife.  No, you cannot.  Oh hey Joey! We\\'ve been watching all day, when are you gonna be on TV?  Uh, listen, I need that broiling pan that Joey borrowed the other day.  William Sonoma, fall catalog, Page 27.  Yeah, so?  Y\\'know what, champ? I think I\\'ll pass.  A Magic Eight ball?! You can\\'t be serious, you can\\'t make this decision with a toy!  Keep talking.  Really?  But, I just cleaned the bathroom.  Okay.  Ow!  I know!  Never done that before.  Okay, Rachel, you wanna put the marshmellows in concentric circles.  Every year.  Well, every, every Thanksgiving um, we used to have a touch football game called the ‘Geller Bowl.’  Anyway, Ross and I were always captains, and um, it got kind’ve competitive and one year, Geller Bowl VI, I accidentally broke Ross’s nose.  To score the winning touchdown, by the way.  Y\\'know what, I think we should play a game. I mean come on, it’s been twelve years.  Okay. Let’s bring it in.  Well, why don’t we just bunny up.  Okay, looks like Ross and I are captains. Okay, so um, I bunnied first so that means I get to pick first. Joey.  Phoebe.  All right people listen, I’ve got exactly twenty-eight minutes before I have to baste again.  Huddle up.  Okay.  Okay, Phoebe you know what you’re doing right?  Okay, Joey’s gonna catch it, and you and I are gonna block.  Phoebe, I thought you said you know what you’re doing?  Break.  Score!! 7 to nothing!  Losers walk!  Come on guys! Let’s go! Come on, it’s second down.  No it’s not, it’s second.  Wow, what?  Pulling what? It’s second down.  I heard that!  Run, Phoebe, run!  After the snap!  Does so count!  Y\\'know what, that’s fine, maybe you haven’t grown up, but I have.  No! Listen, I’m not gonna go through this with you again, okay. Just once I wanna beat when you can’t blame it on the broken nose, the buzzer, or the fact that you thought you were getting mono. Let’s just call this, tie score and it’s halftime.  Y\\'know what? I’ll think you’ll play.  Because the winner gets this!  When Mom and Dad drove you to the hospital to get your nose fixed, I swam into the lake and fished it out.  No it’s not! You want it, you’re gonna have to win it!  Come on Phoebe, let’s go! Come on, it’s time to get serious, huddle up. Joey, keep your head in the game.  All right look, if I take Chandler out of the running will you be able to focus?  All right, you just make sure that Chandler catches the ball, I’ll take care of the rest.  Break!  Whoa! Whoa!! Tackled by a girl! Bet ya don’t see that everyday, do ya?  What?! I just touched him and he went over.  Forty-two to twenty-one! Like the turkey, Ross is done!  You’re so pathetic! Why can’t you just accept it, we’re winning because I’m better than you.  Oh, what a great argument, exhaling! All right, y\\'know what, I’ll prove it to you, okay. I’ll trade you Joey for Rachel, and I’ll still win the game.  Oh, then bring it on! Oh, unless of course your afraid you might lose to a bunch of girls.  Come on Rach, come on. Let’s see what’s it like to be on a winning team for a change.  All right then.  Are we playing football or what? Come on you hairy-backed Marries.  We have to do this. We are playing for women everywhere. Okay, just think about every lousy date that you ever had, okay, every guy who kept on the TV while you’re making out...  Come on, okay, come on this is for all womankind. Let’s kill ‘um!  Honey, there’s a reason.  All right Rachel, you sweep behind, I’ll pitch it to you, you throw it down field to Phoebe. All right. Break.  Thirty-two! Seventy-one! Hike!  No! I’m not okay!  Come on! Come on! Hurry! We’re running out of time! Huddle up!  All right, Phoebe get open. Rachel, go long.  Break!  Let go! I’m a tiny little woman!!  Ow!!  Let go!  No!  I don’t know. I guess the other people just don’t care enough.  Let go!  Joey, she was listing the countries she’s done it in.  Yeah right.  You made a joke right? So I laughed.  Well I’d probably be scared of a guy using a fake voice.  Oh, hey! Oh good, you brought food!  Seriously, where did you get the hat?  What?!  What are you crazy?!  Aww, thank you.  Ah no, the other Phoebe, the one you went to go see.  Oh well, where is he?!  Well, why would she lie to you?  Strip Happy Days Game?  You painting his toenails?  Chasing him all around the room?  He’s totally flirting with you too.  Huh?  You didn’t even take off your pants.  What?  Like a log.  That’s that weird voice again.  That didn’t work on mom, it’s not going to work on us.  No.  Well, you tell a lot of jokes!  So do you think that these pictures—Are, are they trying to tell a story?  Well, she’s not going to find them lying in the grass like that.  Okay, I’ve got a question. If you had to pick one of us to date, who would it be?  Me neither.  What?!  It’s wrong. You know what else is wrong? Phoebe picking Rachel.  That’s a good idea.  Do you know what’s a bad idea?  It’s coming from the living room.  That is completely untrue. You think I’m high maintenance? Okay, prove it. I want you to make a list and we’re going to go through it point by point!  I know. Where do you wanna go eat?  I’m sick of Japanese. We’re not going there.  All right.  No, thank you.  Joey, what are you doing?  Joey, do you work here?  Joey, what’s going on. What didn’t you tell us you work here?  So, maybe I am a little high maintenance. And maybe Rachel is a little bit of a pushover. But you know what we decided you are?  Hah!  Well, then, I’m okay with being high maintenance.  I am not high maintenance!  Why do I have to decide?  I can’t be fair. You’re my boyfriend.  Okay, Chandler, you go first.  Oh, wait, is he the guy I met at Christmas?  Do you want me to pick you?!  Continue.  All right, I’ve heard enough. I’ve made my decision.  You are both idiots. The joke is not funny, and it’s offensive to women, and doctors, and monkeys! You shouldn’t be arguing over who gets credit, you should be arguing over who gets blamed for inflicting this horrible joke upon the world! Now let it go! The joke sucks!  Hi, Chandler. There you are.  Hey, it’s Phoebe and Rachel. Um, why don’t you tell them what you were telling me earlier about me not being high maintenance?  Wait, wait, he came up with that himself. Tell them, Chandler.  Look, I am not high maintenance. I am not. Chandler!  Ahhh! You are on my list.  I pick you, Phoebe.  He was in Ross’s class…marching band…kinda overweight? Well, really overweight. I mean I was his thin friend.  All right okay, just so you know, I’m not gonna make a turkey this year.  Well Phoebe doesn’t eat turkey…  All right! Okay, it’s just Phoebe. Will’s still on a diet, Chandler doesn’t eat Thanksgiving food, and Rachel’s having her aversion to poultry.  Anyway, it just doesn’t seem worth it to make a whole turkey for just three people. Okay? It’s a lot of work.  All right fine! If it means that much to you! But just—there’s gonna be a ton left over.  All right, you’re telling me you can eat an entire turkey in just one sitting?  Hey!  You too!  I’m gonna go across the hall to check on the yams.  No! No! No! No sweetie! No! Not like that! We’re not at a barn dance. You’ve gotta—you wanna fold them like swans. Like I showed you at Christmas time, remember?  Is your team winning hon?  Oh, I didn’t know you liked football.  You like Green Bay?  Hey!  Aww thanks! God Will I’m so glad that you came! You look great! You must’ve lost like…  You wanna meet some people? This is uh; this is my husband Chandler. Chandler, this is Will.  This is Phoebe.  Well you look incredible too! You’re just—you’re so fit!  Oh umm, I meant to tell you, Ross is coming.  Is there a problem?  What?  Hey, what are you doing? You gotta save room, you’ve got almost an entire turkey to eat.  All right.  Will! From high school.  That’s Will from high school!  Okay, dinner’s ready!  Oh, so who won?  What?  About nineteen pounds.  Oh Will. But you-you’ve worked so hard…  Hmm, a little relieved, I gotta say.  You started that?!  Everyone at our school heard it!  I thought it might be true. And I was afraid that you were gonna cry and then show it to me.  Joey, you don’t have to finish that.  Oh! Me too!  That’s not totally true.  Well you-you did start that rumor about Ross making out with Mrs. Altman, our 50-year-old librarian.  It’s true?!!  Didn’t she walk with a cane?  All right, listen you’re just being silly. Rachel, even with that rumor you were one of the most popular girls in school and everyone wanted to be like you. One girl wanted to be like you so much she stuffed her pants with a Tootsie Roll!  And Ross, if it weren’t for Rachel’s rumor I mean no one in high school would even know who you were. She put you on the map!  Hey! Mrs. Altman was the kind of woman you could tell she used to be pretty.  Hey guys this stuff is just so way in the past. You-you’ve been through so much since then. And right now you’ve got so much more important stuff going on in your life. Can’t you just let this go?  Well Joey, we’re all…we’re all very proud of you.  Yeah, you want some?  Hey you guys?  I know it’s last minute, but we decided to have a Halloween party.  You have to!  So Ross, are you gonna bring Mona?  Wait! You’re supposed to wear a costume!  Oh.  I’m Catwoman, who wants to borrow the dress when you’re too big for it.  So we do Supergirl.  What?! I thought he’d love it! His favorite kid\\'s book was the Velveteen Rabbit!  Well, it was either a pink bunny or no bunny at all.  You didn’t dress up either?!  What?! There’s only been like four kids.  What are you supposed to be?  No, space doody!  Hey Joey?  You read comic books right?  Who do you think would win in a fight, Catwoman or Supergirl?  Yeah…  What?! Really?!  Oh really? Okay? Well what would you say if I told you that, y’know, Ross or Chandler could beat you up?  Oh my God, Phoebe!  You’re getting a crush on your sister’s fianc�e.  I can’t answer that! Chandler’s my husband.  Yeah.  Chandler’s making his sex face.  Look, I wanted to tell I’m-I’m sorry you lost.  Chandler please!  Let’s go big bunny!  Okay, guys, listen, don\\'t forget that tomorrow is the day that Emily gets married again, so whatever we do, just try to really keep Ross\\'s mind off of it.  Hey!  Hey! Oh, I\\'m so glad you\\'re home, I thought tonight we could finally organize these photos!  You can also find him under umm, dog and dead.  All right, hand me that other box of photos; that\\'s the very last one.  I hadn\\'t! Photo 152 was a prototype.  All right, he\\'s keys are in the drawer. Y\\'know what? I also need some cash.  Nah, while you\\'re at Ross\\'s if you see any lying around…  What?! I-I-I don\\'t, I don\\'t do that!  I need a few more things to make the margaritas. Uhh, I need some salt, some margarita mix, and tequila.  See if he has ice.  Well thank God you were here! I mean, we have to erase that!  We have too! I mean what if Ross\\'s hears that and then calls her back and then they get back together? Is that what you want? Ross back with that controlling, neurotic, crazy Emily? The Emily that wouldn\\'t let him see you?  I\\'m his sister, okay? I love him! I don\\'t want to see him get hurt! Come on! Doesn’t that give me the right to control him—help him?  Y\\'know what, this is obviously some kind of twisted joke she\\'s trying to play on him.  All right, I guess we should go.  There\\'s nothing we can do. You erased the message!  Well, if you\\'re gonna be totally rational about this, I can\\'t argue with you! All right? Fine, if you wanna tell him, tell him. I just don\\'t want to be a part of it.  Wow! Play that message for Emily and this whole problem goes away!  Man, I would be great in a war! I mean, I really, I think I would make a fantastic military leader. I mean I know I would make General way before any of you guys.  Hey Hon, could you help me get the plates down?  No, I think we should save our china for something really special. Like if the Queen of England comes over.  What if something gets broken, they\\'re so expensive.  Ok, but if something gets broken, and then the Queen comes over..  <laughs> Oh yeah, like I\\'m going to let you talk to the queen.  Careful. <hands Chandler a china plate> Careful. CAREFUL!  I know, after you left the store, I chose different ones.  well no offense honey, but your taste is a little feminine for me.  yeah oh my god, I\\'m so moved.  Okay! It\\'s time for dinner. Everyone we\\'re using our fancy china.. um and its very expensive so please be careful.  Okay, just to be clear comedy with the plates will not be well recieved. <pinches Ross\\' arm>  No, honey, its. thats a special plate.  See its a game, whoever gets that plate wins.  That was me.  Now see, this way you protect the plate.. and lets face it you have fun.  Thats not how you see me, is it?  Hey. There you are. You disappeared after dinner.  Ross and Rachel don\\'t know what they\\'re talking about. I mean its not like their so responsible. Emma is a product of a bottle of Merlot and a five year old condom.  No you learn these things. You grow into it.  I don\\'t know it! I want to have a kid with you because I think you\\'re going to be an amazing dad... at the fun parts and the hard parts.  Can you hear me say \"You\\'re grounded\"?  How hard is it? No shoes on the furniture.  Oh wait.. What are you doing?  Oh how nice. Maybe later we can all go blow our noses on my wedding dress.  Put the plates in the boxes!! Put the plates in the boxes!  uh huh.. I mean these things happen. Its\\' just a plate. Its not like somebody died.  I don\\'t care. <pauses and realizes...> Oh my god. I\\'ve lost the will to scold.  Like only if the queen comes?  Bye plates!  What? Something happened with the plates?  You can not do this.  Roger wants to take her out tomorrow night.  But Phoebe, you can go out with a creepy guy any night of the year. I know I do.  Which one was Pete Carney?  I don\\'t know. Maybe we\\'re some kinda magnets.  There\\'s more beer, right?  Ok, well, what kind of ritual?  Burning\\'s good.  Oh, Chandler, sorry.  Ohhh, Chandler, sorry! Hey, Janice.  Rach, come see who\\'s out here!  I\\'ll be right back.  All I have is, is oregano and a Fresca.  Can we just start throwing things in?  Look, here\\'s a picture of Scotty Jared naked.  No.  Hey, Rachel, isn\\'t that stuff almost pure...  You know, it\\'s a really funny story how this happened.  They\\'re nice guys.  Yes! Carol and Susan\\'s caterer had a mountain bike accident this weekend, and she\\'s in a full body cast.  They want me to do it, which is really cool, seeing as I\\'ve never catered before, and I really need the money, and this isn\\'t a problem for you, is it?  They love each other, and they wanna celebrate that love with the people that are close with them.  Ross, I thought you were over this.  What?  Oh, honey.  God, this is so hard. I can\\'t decide between lamb or duck.  Why? It\\'s not like I\\'m putting little nipples on them.  Is there any chance that you can look at this as flattering? I mean, she\\'s doing it because she wants to be more like you.  Um, you guys, you know when I said before, \"thank you, but I don\\'t really need your help\"?  Really? Weird. Anyway, see, I planned everything really well. I planned and I planned and I planned. It just turns out, I don\\'t think I planned enough time to actually do it.  If you want.  All right, look, nobody\\'s smoking pot around all this food.  I\\'m dicing, I\\'m dicing, I don\\'t hear anything.  All right people, we\\'re in trouble here. We\\'ve only got 12 hours and 36 minutes left. Move, move, move!  Joey, speed it up!  Do you want me to cry? Is that what you want? Do you wanna see me cry?  All right, look, Ross. I realize that you have issues with Carol and Susan, and I feel for you, I do. But if you don\\'t help me cook, I\\'m gonna take a bunch of those little hot dogs, and I\\'m gonna create a new appetizer called \"pigs in Ross\". All right, ball the melon.  Hi.  You\\'re still gonna pay me, right? Or something a little less selfish.  So we\\'re back on?  You heard the woman. Peel, chop, devil! I can\\'t believe I lost 2 minutes.  Would you look at them?  Ok, which one of us do you think is gonna be the first one to get married?  All right, just trying to start an interesting discussion.  Mail call, Rachel Green, bunk seven.  Oh good! \\'Cause where else would we get any?  What is it?  Barry who you almost...?  And Mindy, your maid of...?  Hi.  Wonderful!  There was nudity!  Oh, hang on, hang on. Does Aunt Monica get a say in this?  Wait. He pooped in my shoe? Which one?  Which ones?  He- he pooped in my shoe.  Those cute little black ones I wear all the time.  Okay, we\\'ll start with the building. You guys take the first and second floor, Phoebe and I\\'ll take third and fourth.  Okay, you stay here, and just wait by the phone. Spray Lysol in my shoe, and wait for Ross to kill you.  Mr. Heckles, our friend lost a monkey. Have you seen it?  No!  A monkey. Have you seen a monkey?  Hi. We checked the third and fourth floor, no-one\\'s seen Marcel.  Pheebs, you remember how we talked about saying things quietly to yourself first?  Look. I\\'m sure there\\'s some friendly way to reconcile this! Um, have a seat. First of all, we haven\\'t been introduced, I\\'m Monica Geller.  The Luisa from home room!  No, none at all.  Oh, I\\'m- I\\'m so sorry!  Be that as it may, d\\'you think you could just help us out here on that monkey thing? Y\\'know, just for old times\\' sake? Go Bobcats?  Marcel?  Whaaat!  What is it?  Look, Phoebe!  What\\'re you gonna do?  Oh gosh.  This is me in The Sound of Music. See the von Trapp kids?  That\\'s because I\\'m in front of them.  Well, high school was not my favourite time.  Gosh, doesn\\'t it seem like a million years ago?  Yesss!!  Shhh!  Chip, is Chip Matthews.  ‘Cause I ran into him at the bank, he is still soo cute.  Hey!  Now? Is it okay if I go out with Chip Matthews?  What, that little thing at the prom?  Come on, that was back in high school! How could that still bother you?  Look, you and I went to different high schools...  You went to one where you were popular, and you got to ride off Chip’s motorcycle, and wear his letterman jacket. I went to one where I wore a band uniform they had to have specially made.  It was a project for one of the Home Ec classes.  Back then, I thought that I would never, ever get the chance to go out with a Chip Matthews, and now he’s-he’s called me up and asked me out. And the fat girl inside of me really wants to go. I-I owe her this. I never let her eat.  Oh, really?!  I’ll try.  Why can’t you use the phone in here?  Ross, don’t start.  Oh, but it’s made her so happy.  He is right, isn’t he?  Hi!  Oh my God! You still have the Chipper!  That’s what we used to call your ah, your motorcycle in high school. Y\\'know how a motorcycle is a Chopper, and you’re Chip. Nevermind.  Wow! A lipper from Chipper.  Umm. Well, there’s Rachel, and umm, I think that’s it. How bout you?  Is that all?  Ohh, how is he?  Isn’t he an architect now?  Look, not that I enjoy talking about people who I went to high school with, ‘cause I do, but umm, maybe we could talk about something else? Like you, I don’t even know where you work?  I do?  You still work at the multiplex?  Thanks, I’m set. Do you still live with your parents?  Well, y\\'know how I always wanted to go out with Chip Matthews in high school?  Well, tonight, I actually went out with Chip Matthews in high school.  No, it’s okay, not only did I get to go out with Chip Matthews, I got to dump Chip Matthews.  I know!  Hey, we can take her back with you if you want.  Yeah, sure.  Y\\'know those are a delicacy in India.  Wow, she must have hurt you pretty bad, huh?  Oh, you two must have been so cute running around on a barge.  No, umm, he met some girl at the coffee house.  Yeah, Ginger something.  Well, what did you do?  You gave her food poisoning!?  Oh my God! Joey, what did you do after you threw her leg on the fire?  Y\\'know they say a watched pot never beeps.  Phoebe why don’t you just call her? You obviously want to.  Well, don’t ‘cha wanna?  Okay, well I do know you.  Well so?  So umm, how was your date with Ginger?  Sounds like she’s got the ah, whole package.  Uh-huh.  Sorry, Pheebs.  We’d love too.  Wow! It’s like Rachel in High School.  Come on! Come on, I was kidding! It was such an obvious joke!  Since we\\'ve been going out, I think I\\'ve mentioned his name twice!  It\\'s not Richard! Okay? It\\'s this new guy and he\\'s really good.  Bye!  Why are so mad at him?  Well, it just seems that…  Hey Rach, come on! We\\'re gonna be late for the eye doctor appointment!  I\\'m kidding! I\\'m kidding!  A small puff of air, now come on!  Y\\'know what, I\\'m gonna hold her head.  They\\'re still in my coat.  I love you.  I wanna say good-bye at the car!  Oh, I know! Umm, is it because he\\'s always correcting people\\'s grammar? Whom! Whom! Sometimes it\\'s who!  Chandler! What are you doing here?  Not even close.  Okay! All right! Let\\'s do it!  Put your head back.  All right.  Now, open your eyes.  Oh my God, I was thinking four.  Yes! All right, y\\'know what? Why don\\'t we start with a practice run? Okay?  No drops!  Okay.  Then why did you move?!  What did you do to his sweater vests?  Well, maybe you should send him something. So that when he gets to Las Vegas he\\'ll know that you\\'re sorry.  Hey Joey! Aww, you remembered even though you\\'re a big star!  Joey, what\\'s it like on a movie set, huh? Do you have a dressing room? Do you have a chair with your name on it?  Go!!  Oh, Aunt Liddy’s coming? That means we get five dollars each!  About what?  Isn’t she beautiful?  I want a baby.  Come on! Come on, if we have sex again it’ll double our chances of getting pregnant. Do you think that closet’s still available?  Deal!  Oh, I still can’t believe my dad saw us having sex! He didn’t make it to one of piano recitals, but this he sees!  Hi Dad! I can still call you that right?  It wasn’t fun?!  The truth is, Dad, we’re-we’re trying.  Yeah, we’re trying to get pregnant.  Well, that’s okay dad, we-we can wait until later.  Daddy?!  Daddy! I don’t think we need to hear about the specific positions you and mom had sex.  I don’t feel good right now.  Hey.  Well, now’s a good time. I’m on my way to have my ears cut off.  What?  Is he crazy?! You just had Ross’s baby!  You can’t marry him!  Well do you love him?  Sure?  Honey, the question is…do you really want to marry Joey?  Yeah, I think I have some around here somewhere. Why?  Oh my God, are you out of a job?  Umm, excuse me, we switched apartments. You can’t eat are food anymore, that-that gravy train had ended.  What are you doing?  You made pancakes?  Oh, I was thinking about having people over for the game.  The players.  Fresh cookies! Hot from the oven!  Please, have some!  Yeah, I’ve just been fiddling around in here making delicious treats for everyone.  Yeah, it’s just something I picked up.  Wait! Wait! This isn’t take-out!  No, wait, please don’t go! I’ve got porn for you too!  People are supposed to wanna hang out here!  I’m the hostess! Not those guys! I’m always the hostess! I mean, I was always the hostess, I mean even when I was little, I mean the girls brought their dollies to my tea party, I-I served the best air.  ‘Cause they took our apartment, I wanted to punish them. But I’m-I’m done now. They’ve suffered enough.  All right then, when I’m done with this place, it’s gonna be ten times better than that place!  Are you sure?  Nah, I got it.  Just come.  You used to have carpet.  So I made snacks. Please, just hang out okay? I’m just gonna rest my eyes just a little bit.  Oh no-no-no, stay, stay, stay, just keep talking. I’m always the hostess.  I’m sorry, they surprised me. There was nothing I could do!  Ugh, I knew giving you that book was gonna come back and bite me in the ass!  Yeah, I got this number from this guy at work and I hired a stripper to come dance for you. Am I going in the wife hall of fame or what?!  Come on! Come on, it’ll be fun! It’ll make me feel so much better.  So don’t think of it as a bachelor party, think of it as a…a two month anniversary present.  Please! I feel so bad! Just watch the hot woman get naked!  Thank you. All right, now who else do you want to invite?  Yeah! Hey! Thanks for getting me that girl’s number.  My husband.  She’s a stripper.  Is that, is that what they call strippers sometimes?  Oh my God Stu! I-I can’t believe you did this! Now are you absolutely sure she’s a hooker?  I swear I didn’t know she was a hooker! I mean wh—Did you let her smoke in here?  What?  Oh God! Orange juice just came out of my nose, but it was totally worth it. Oh my God, I completely forgot about your sound.  He used to lock himself in the basement for hours. No one was every allowed to hear, \"The Sound.\"  Yeah!  Oh God bless my dad sound proofing the basement!  Phoebe, Ross sucks!  Okay. Umm, Phoebe, you suck too.  Yeah! Joey has the best boyfriend ever!  Are you serious?  He loves you.  I remember you did.  Okay, so you were trying to play bad this whole time.  Wait a minute, she isn’t… She’s not the one who you…  Wow!  Okay, I think that’s it. The seating chart is done. This is our wedding. They all look like they’re having fun don’t they?  Why would they think they’re invited?  Joey!  Ross’s parents are my parents!  Oh please, you just want more blue pins.  All right, all right. Maybe I can fit them in if I just do some rearranging. But uh, Rachel may actually have to sit at the bar!  Hey. Oh good-good you’re here! All right, I figured it out. I’m gonna take two tables of eight, I’m gonna add your parents, and I’m gonna turn them into three tables of six. Okay? And I called the caterer; I added two extra meals, we are good to go!  Oh that’s too bad. It’s true, but too bad.  Oh Joey!  No she hasn’t.  Well, what am I going to say?  Well, he did manage to keep his identity secret for a long time.  What are you talking about?! 007 has all those gadgets!  007 has a fancy car!  007 gets all the ladies.  How about you go put on your 007 tuxedo and I’ll make you a nice martini.  How about a Youhoo with a funny straw?  Hey.  The show?!  Have you ever been to one of my weddings?  The wedding starts at six.  You’ll vamp?!  You just carry that around?  Between you and…  A little tight? I could see double-oh and seven in those pants.  All right that’s it, I give up! Whatever you want you can have it! You wanna sing a song? You wanna do a dance? You want your mom stand at the Alter and scream racial slurs? I don’t care!  Hey, I have all the space I need. Just do what I did.  Y’know what? I am really tired of your bellyaching! Okay, I-I worked really hard at making this a nice place for us to live!  Okay.  Shut up! This place is a hole!  Hey, guys, what-what should I wear to a Knicks game?  Yeah, apparently, they’re pretty good seats.  Yeah, what, do you think we’re stupid?  What do you say?  Have you even had a girl up here?  All right, so what do you say?  Oh, just do it!!  They’re green?  That’s not even a game!  You wanna finish this right now? All right, we get a deck of cards, high card wins. What do you say?  Oh, good.  Because we won our apartment back!  No! Ace is low! Ace, two, three, four!  But, we pick again! We pick again!  I don’t know!  No, we’re not! We’re not leaving!  As a thank you, Rachel and I will kiss for one minute.  Men are such idiots.  Yeah, let-let-let’s pretend that’s not true.  What-what’s going on?  When, when did—how, how did you…  Would you let it go? It\\'s not that big a deal.  Chandler, nobody likes breaking up with someone. You just gotta do it.  Oh, you\\'re breaking up with Tony?  Did he give you that whole \"You\\'re-not-up-to-this\" thing again?  Wow, being dumped by you obviously agrees with her.  Forget it. Not after your cousin who could belch the alphabet.  Ugly Naked Guy\\'s laying kitchen tile. Eww!  What\\'s going on here? You go out with tons of girls.  Thank you. So what does this Bob guy look like? Is he tall? Short?  Which?  You\\'ve never met Bob, have you?  Oh my god, Joey, for all we know this guy could be horribly...  ...horribly attractive. I\\'ll be shutting up now.  How, how did that happen?  What?  I\\'ve gotta tell you, Bob is terrific.  It is so great to meet a guy who is smart and funny, and has an emotional age beyond, like eight.  Wow. My brother never even told me when he lost his virginity.  Something went wrong with Underdog, and they couldn\\'t get his head to inflate. So anyway, um, his head is like flopping down Broadway, right, and I\\'m just thinking... how inappropriate this is. Um, I\\'ve got something in my eye, uh, Joey, could we check it in the light, please?  Oh my god.  Hello! Were we at the same table? It\\'s like... cocktails in Appalachia.  Close? She\\'s got her tongue in his ear.  Joey, this is sick, it\\'s disgusting, it\\'s, it\\'s—not really true, is it?  Oh my god, what were you thinking?  Really?  I\\'m so sorry, I can\\'t believe I did this, but I couldn\\'t stop laughing at your Norman Mailer story.  Hi.  We ripped that couple apart, and kept the pieces for ourselves.  Hey!  So, do you guys wanna come and eat dinner at the restaurant sometime in the next few weeks?  Well you can\\'t! We\\'re booked solid for the next month!  Oh, honey!I can\\'t. I was just telling these guys that things are crazy at the restaurant!  Yeah, I\\'m sorry. I really am.  Tell them I\\'m a chef in a big New York restaurant!  Why don\\'t you take Ross?  No, not if their room has two beds!  Thank you!  Oh..please!I-I welcome criticism.  What musician?  What are you doing here!  Great!  Listen Phoebe...  You know how much I love listening to your music, you know, but...  This is kind of a classy place.  Yeah.  Let me think. Oh, when I was younger I used to dream that I got married to Mayor McCheese, and on our wedding night I ate his head.  Wow, do you mean like kiss him-kiss him?  What do you think brought than on?  A love scene? With who?  I don\\'t know. I mean, you saw him do a love scene, so maybe you don\\'t have a thing for Joey, maybe you have a thing for Drake.  Of course it was! Trust me, when it comes to psychology I know what I\\'m talking about. I took two psych classes in college.  It was hard!  Oh...Phoebe? Maybe I wasn\\'t clear before. I really love listening to your music here, but my restaurant is sort of an upscale place.  Phoebe, it\\'s not what you wear. It\\'s sort of your songs... I just don\\'t think you should play at the restaurant anymore.  I didn\\'t say your songs were not good enough.  Tiny portions?  Phoebe, it\\'s not about quantity.  Oh really, you want to talk about quality? Have you heard of a key? It\\'s what some people sing in.  Ok, so that\\'s what we\\'re doing. You know, when I\\'m in the coffee house bopping along to one of your songs, I\\'m wearing ear plugs.  You know what? I take back what I said before. You keep playing at the restaurant, because with your music driving people inside, my bar sales are going up like crazy.  Thank god, it\\'s just you! I thought someone was swinging a bag of cats against the wall.  Ok, you have to stop playing now.  Oh yeah? Ok, let\\'s settle this, come on!  I\\'m sorry...  ooohh... hey! Wanna stick around and I\\'ll whip you up some dinner?  Rose Marie really belongs on a smaller screen, doesn\\'t she?  What\\'s tonight?  Uh, hello.  Tonight you\\'re supposed to waitress for me, my catering thing, any of those words trigger anything for you?  Yes but my mom got me this job.  Really Phoebs? Because, you know, you\\'d have to be an actual waitress. This can\\'t be like your \\'I can be a bear cub\\' thing.  Sorry we\\'re late.  Dr. Burke, it, it\\'s me.  Thank you. This is my friend Phoebe. She\\'s gonna be helping me tonight.  The head tilt?  I\\'m sorry.  You\\'ve got to get back out there, it\\'s your party.  You\\'re an opthamologist.  Alright, I\\'ll tell you what. I\\'ll come get you in 5 minutes with some sort of um, kabob emergency.  I am not.  Dr. Burke? I don\\'t think so. I mean, like, he\\'s a grown up.  Phoebe, he\\'s a friend of my parents. He\\'s like 20 years older than me.  Not never. I mean, I\\'m gonna see him tomorrow at my eye appointment.  Well yeah, but, you know, uh, 27 is a dangerous eye age.  Really.  Good, they feel good, in my head.  You too.  OK, um. Goodbye.  What?  Thanks. So, I guess I better be going.  Thanks again.  Stop sending food to our apartment.  No one.  Nothing.  Alright, but I\\'m very excited about this OK, so you gotta promise you won\\'t get all big-brothery and judgmental.  It\\'s Richard Burke.  Well for your information he happens to be one of the brightest, most sophisticated, sexiest men I\\'ve ever been with.  When?  Wow, is that Michelle?  I\\'ve not seen her since high school graduation. Oh my God, that night she got so dru. . . motional.  I thought she just had one.  Oh, you\\'re a grandpa.  I don\\'t know, maybe. I mean I\\'m dating a man who\\'s pool I once peed in.  Yeah.  So maybe we should just. . .  Wow, this really sucks.  Well, we don\\'t really have to decide anything right now, do we?  Oh, I\\'m gonna kill those guys.  Hey!  Yep, we\\'re gonna meet the lady who could be carrying our baby.  She\\'s only a couple of months pregnant. She liked our application but who knows if she\\'s gonna like us.  And a lot could still get in our way.  Oh my God. She\\'s gonna pick us!  You know, I know that things could still go wrong but if they don\\'t? If this works out, we\\'re gonna have a baby Chandler, a baby!  Uh, we\\'re gonna be great.  Well... obviously!  Hi. It is so, so nice to meet you.  I don\\'t know about that.  Amen.  It says “Do it!”. And behold she did adopt onto them a baby. And it was good.  Oh, you know, my flock is good, I mean, yeah, my flock pretty much takes care of themselves at this point. Good flock. Flock, flock, flock.  We don’t?  Why not?  God works in mysterious ways.  But she liked us.  C\\'mon Chandler, I think we have been given an opportunity. I mean, the mistake has already been made. They are writing up the paper right now.  I mean, who knows how long it\\'s gonna take for someone else to give us a baby? What if, what if no one ever picks us?  Technicality!  Look, doctor!  But we were hoping that since we told you the truth that you still might consider...  Well, you don\\'t have to decide right now, but if you could just look at our file...  God bless you Chandler Bing!  Guys. I thought you were taking Ross to the game?  No! Rachel is meeting us here.  It’s never taken you more than a shower to get over a relationship.  Let’s get the show on it!  Oh Rachel, I know the best coffee house and it’s sooo close.  We’re sorry honey.  Very bad.  Chandler!!  Weren’t you nine?!  We’re really sorry, but um, she did ask us first.  Noo! I’ll stay. He’s my brother.  No! We’re gonna have fun. We can make fudge!  Why? Do you think he’s still mad at us?  No Chandler no! No unscheduled stops. You can go when we stop for gas.  What?  Ow!  So, if you’re parents hadn’t got divorced, you’d be able to answer a question like a normal person?  What?!  Please!!  These tiny, little non-breasts?! Please, it’s gotta be Rachel.  All right then, your bra would still be big.  Chandler!!  Freemont. West-Westmont, ah Westburg?  Who? I mean have you seen a car come by here in the last hour and a half? I think we should call Ross, maybe he can get a car and come pick us up.  So the going for help went well?  Then why are you smoking?  Huh. What’s doofus spelled backwards?  I know, what about Rachel? I mean how are we even gonna ask her?  Umm, if ah, it might be okay if Ross came skiing?  Here we go again.  What I said was, was that I understood. Joey’s the one who agreed with you!  All right, we’ll call you when we get back.  Uh, no. Loosely translated \\'We should do this again\\' means \\'You will never see me naked\\'.  Uh, Ross.  No, no, no. They say it\\'s the same as the distance from the tip of a guy\\'s thumb to the tip of his index finger.  What did they do to you?  We\\'re with you. We got it.  Alright. I\\'m gonna go change, I\\'ve got a date.  \\'S\\'going pretty good, y\\'know? It\\'s nice, and, we\\'re having fun.  Let\\'s see, today\\'s Monday... Never.  No. Not after what happened with Steve.  Look, I don\\'t even know how I feel about him yet. Just give me a chance to figure that out.  Nope. Schhorry.  I mean, why should I let them meet him? I mean, I bring a guy home, and within five minutes they\\'re all over him. I mean, they\\'re like- coyotes, picking off the weak members of the herd.  I know. I just wish that once, I\\'d bring a guy home that they actually liked.  Do you all promise?  Hi. Alan, this is everybody. Everybody, this is Alan.  C\\'mon!  Wait a minute! We\\'re talking about someone that I\\'m going out with?  Really!  Hi.. how was the game?  Fantastic! I have one question: How is that possible?  Can I ask you guys a question? D\\'you ever think that Alan is maybe.. sometimes..  ..I dunno, a little too Alan?  Oh, why is it unfair?  Did you ever go out with a guy your friends all really like?  Okay.. Well, I\\'m going out with a guy my friends all really like.  Can you believe it? ...Y\\'know what? I just don\\'t feel the thing. I mean, they feel the thing, I don\\'t feel the thing.  I know.. it\\'s gonna be really hard.  No, he\\'ll be fine. It\\'s the other five I\\'m worried about.  Nothing. I just think it\\'s nice when we\\'re all here together.  Please, guys, we have to talk.  Alright, we have to talk.  Okay. It\\'s-it\\'s about Alan. There\\'s something that you should know. I mean, there\\'s really no easy way to say this.. uh.. I\\'ve decided to break up with Alan.  No, nononono.. it\\'s just.. things change. People change.  Look, I- I could go on pretending-  -but that wouldn\\'t be fair to me, it wouldn\\'t be fair to Alan- It wouldn\\'t be fair to you!  I\\'m sorry..  I\\'ll meet somone else. There\\'ll be other Alans.  Are you guys gonna be okay?  I\\'m, I\\'m really sorry.  Relieved?  Oh, y\\'know..  I need two. I’m bringing Pete. My boyfriend. I have a boyfriend now!  Really? Who’s number two?  Bye-bye!  Joey, what are you doing?! It’s never gonna happen, she’s seeing somebody.  Uh-huh.  Phoebe?  All right. Honey, that’s-that’s a sleeve. Okay?  Okay, wait, you gotta hang up ‘cause we’re gonna be late.  Of course not.  There’s our star!  Hi!  Yeah, and in the long version, I dump him for telling people the short version.  Hey!  Yeah. Where were you?  You were the next caller five hours ago. You must be going crazy.  Hey! Didn’t you have that outfit on last night?  Anyway, how did it go with Kate?  Joey, you had the night!  When two people finally realise their feelings for each other, and-and they talk for hours, and they-they learn all about the other person!  Did you like learn about her family?  Yes!!  One.  We’re kidding!  Umm, going to the beach. When it stays light real late.  Phoebe, it’s been two days.  What?  Joey, you have to talk to her!  Hey Rachel!  What’s up?  We were playing a game.  Sure.  Honey, you gotta talk to her.  Hello? No rejection? I got shot down at fat camp! Boy, kids are mean when they’re hungry.  This is Rachel. I mean, what are you gonna do, never going to talk to her again? I mean I know it’s weird, it’s awkward, but you gotta at least try.  Okay, I’m done. Read mine.  You mean your pink shirt?  No, I-I haven’t seen your pink shirt.  Tea gives Phoebe the trots.  Honey, what is the Bruce Springsteen CD in the Kat Stevens case?  Okay, where is the Kat Stevens CD?  Where is the James Taylor CD?  Okay. No need to panic. Deep breathes everyone. Okay umm uh, we’re just gonna have to spend some time and put the CDs in the right cases.  Hmm, I don’t know. We really have to talk this through.  Okay, I-I’m sorry. You and Joey, your both focusing on this uncomfortable thing, what you need to do is to change the subject. Next time you see him try to get him talking about something else.  Yeah, like I don’t know, maybe you have a work problem that you need his advice on.  Uh I really don’t know what to tell you Rach, I really don’t. I mean, maybe Joey can help you out with your, with your big work problem.  Honey, both yours.  Yeah? The work problem?  You said your boss wants to buy your baby?!  Chandler has two copies of Annie!  That’s not your regular dry cleaners.  What?!  Don’t worry Phoebe, you’re gonna meet someone. If I can meet a great guy, so can you.  We, we just wanna see the end.  Ya know, I was thinking. Ya know how we always stay at your apartment? Well, I thought maybe tonight we\\'d stay at my place.  Well, maybe you don\\'t need them.  Shut up, I\\'m happy.  Not a lot, Phoebe\\'s kidding, Phoebe\\'s crazy.  Well it wasn\\'t that many guys. I mean, if you consider how many guys there actually are, it\\'s a very small percentage.  Alright, before I tell you, uh, why don\\'t you tell me how many women you\\'ve been with.  Two? TWO? How is that possible? I mean, have you seen you?  Ok, it is definitely less than a ballpark.  Well yeah.  You really ok with it?  Oh, yay. Ok about that two.  Well, it just seems like a really small number.  And, well, don\\'t you have a lot of wild oats to sew? Or is that what you\\'re doing with me? Oh my God, am I an oat?  But you\\'ve only slept with two people.  Wow. Oh wow. You know I love you too, right.  Hi. Richard just told me he loves me.  I know. I just can\\'t find...  You need one too?  There\\'s only one.  No.  Alright, I tell you what, I\\'ll give this to you now if you can tell me where we keep the dustpan.  Yeah.  Fine, go have sex.  It\\'s not gonna happen. They\\'re doing it tonight, we can do it tomorrow.  Why?  Wait, he\\'s not here yet.  Alright.  Did they just kill off Joey?  And some of us really have to pee.  Um, I straightened out your shower curtain so you won\\'t get mildew. What? To me that\\'s nice.  You are so cute! How did you get to be so cute?  Okay, now you\\'re even cuter!!  What?  What are you talking about?  That\\'s not possible!  I\\'m sorry it\\'s just, Phoebe just always thought you were, you were charming in a, in a sexless kind of way.  I\\'m sorry, I think that you just misunderstood her.  This bicep?  Uhh, y\\'know actually I was gonna do some laundry.  Hey Chandler, wanna do it with me?  Okay.  I mean I-I don\\'t I think I have enough quarters.  Oh, is it that pinball machine with the big bow on it?  Well what did you send?  Bye!  Actually, I did!  Ohhh, oh my God! Oh my God! She knows about us!  Phoebe knows and she\\'s just trying to freak us out! That\\'s the only explanation for it!  Them?! Who\\'s them?  Joey!  Unless…  Oh man, they think they are so slick messing with us! But see they don\\'t know that we know that they know! So…  Oh yeah!  All right, it\\'ll be great! You just make her think you wanna have sex with her! It\\'ll totally freak her out!  Relax, she-she\\'s gonna give in way before you do!  Because you\\'re on my team! And my team always wins!  She\\'s bluffing!  You go back out there and you seduce her till she cracks!  Of course.  Well actually, Ross doesn\\'t.  Yeah, ah, but Pheebs don’t you think he’s a little young to get married?  So, um, how-how did you guys meet?  And y\\'know what, I just realised, in the last year I’ve only gone out with two guys, Richard and Julio. You gotta help me out here, you gotta set me up, you gotta get me back in the game.  Haven’t you and I covered that topic?  Aww, the only reason you want to go out with me because my blond wig, and the big boobs, and the fact that I serve you food.  I mean really, think about it.  Nah, he doesn’t do anything for me.  Hey.  Uh, yeah.  Here you go.  As a joke, this customer at work who has a crush on me gave me a $20,000 tip. His number is on the check, he just did so I’d call him.  That’s Bill Clinton.  Oh my God! That’s Pete! But why is Bill huggin’ Pete?  I’m not gonna go out with him.  Or incredibly offensive.  Seriously, what is this supposed to mean?  You’re supposed to double the tax. Not double the tax of Romania. I mean, what’s-what’s the deal? Are you, are you trying to buy me? Is this the way you get girls to go out with you?  What?!  Okay, umm, you’re a loon.  I don’t know.  ‘Cause I don’t want to encourage this kind of behaviour.  Guys, please, I’m just gonna have dinner with him. Okay?  I know!!  Oh, that’s sounds great.  Oh come on, it’s only fair, you paid for the flight. Now is, is that enough lire?  Why, how much is that?  Joey!  Congratulations! Wow! I can’t believe you’re nominated for an Emmy!  Oh Soap Opera Digest award!  Honey? Is that something you’re making up?  Phoebe, I’m engaged!  Hey! How’d your date go with Jake?  Okay, stop it Phoebe, you’re getting me all tingly.  And did he?  Okay-okay, I got it. I got it.  Oh, I haven’t had that feeling since I first started going out with Chandler. Wow, I’m never gonna have that feeling again am I?  No, a guy would be saying, \"I’m never gonna get to sleep with anyone else.\" Oh my God! I’m never gonna get to sleep with anyone else! I’ve been so busy planning the wedding that I forgot about all the things that I’d be giving up! I mean, I…I’m never gonna have a first kiss again.  Phoebe, it’s okay. You don’t have to tip toe around me. I-I’ve been thinking about it and umm, y’know what? I’m okay about not having that new relationship feeling…  Have you seen Chandler?  ‘Cause I just keeping thinking about all these things that I’m not gonna have and it’s freaking me out. I don’t know what to do about it.  Phoebe! Come on I’m serious! I just got to talk to him about all this.  Why?  You gotta help me out here Pheebs.  So I’m not supposed to share my doubts and fears with the guy I’m gonna spend the rest of my life with?  Your mother told you this?  The woman that got married a bunch of times and killed herself when you were 13?  Honey, as we get closer to the wedding, is there anything that you would like to talk about or share?  You’re wrong! The centerpieces are fine! Do you ever get scared at all?  Doesn’t it ever just freak you out that-that you’re never gonna be with anybody new again?  Just, I love you so much. Just…It’s just sometimes it bothers me that I’m never gonna have that feeling. Y’know when you meet someone for the first time and it’s new and exciting? Y’know that rush?  Okay, but all right you’re a guy, does it not freak you that you’re never gonna sleep with anybody else?  Even with me?  Really?  Hey!  Also both of your sisters called and neither can make it.  Oh my God, your mother!  Well, given that we forgot to invite her it would be an awfully big coincidence if she was.  Well it wasn’t my fault, Phoebe was in charge of the invitations!  Okay, y’know what? Don’t worry, okay? We’ll take care of it. We’ll call her. Just go home and get ready.  Yeah, I’m sorry. I’m-I’m so sorry.  You ordered a stripper for the shower?! That is totally inappropriate!  Hi!  Yes, thank you so much. And again, we’re so sorry. We could not feel worse about it.  She’s still mad.  Phoebe, Sandra’s mad at you too. It-it doesn’t bother you?  What?  I personally would be honored if she wanted to live with me.  That’s right. That is right, you go over there and tell her you don’t want her to live with you. Do not take no for an answer!  Yes! Yes! And I think that the first gift that Rachel opens should be from the grandmother of the baby, because you’re the most important person in this room. And in the world!  Rachel, listen to your mother. She is very smart.  It’s frightening.  Y’know what? You’re-you’re right.  Really?  That’s right! Maybe it’s time you took a good hard look at a mirror young lady…old lady…lady!  Yeah? I’m proud of me too.  Yeah could-could-could you get me something to drink?  Hey.  I\\'m making cookies for Erica. And oh, by the way, we have to leave for the airport soon, her plane comes in about an hour.  Hey.  No, we haven\\'t seen her since this morning.  Hey!  These are for Erica!  Well, I want he baby to come out all cute and fat!  Well, because we want to get to know her better and she\\'s never been to New York so she wants to see all the tourists\\' spots... you know, Statue of Liberty, Empire State Building...  Well, if it annoys you so much, then why do you do it?  Honey.  I want you to meet someone really special. Phoebe, this is Erica. And this is the baby!  Joey. Erica, baby!  Everyone. Erica, baby!  Oh, I\\'m glad. Listen, I want to apologize about Chandler, though. I just did not see this coming.  What is with you?  Yeah, you miss alot, when you\\'re moo-ing.  Oh! It was our pleasure. We are so much enjoying getting to know you.  How\\'s that now?  Are you awake?  Alright, we don\\'t know that it\\'s him. I mean, it could be the football guy.  Alright, lets say that it is him, would we not want the baby? No! Would we treat him any differently?  How?  Yeah, but maybe we\\'re just over-reacting.  Nope, she doesn\\'t have to, I found out who the father is.  The thing we never do.  Ross, you did not come up with \"got milk?\"  Hey!  He just left.  What is she talking about?  Is it a good play?  No, but… I saw the previews. They played it right before Jackass.  Hey! Maybe the monkey will be at the audition!  Hey, how did the audition go?  What happened?  So you\\'re a little older. Try to look at the positive: You have all this life experience.  Ah, come on, sneakers are easy. You wear sneakers all the time.  Okay, have you considered using a girl with huge knockers?  You okay?!  You\\'re mother killed herself!  Well, this must\\'ve brought back some really bad memories for you, Ross.  Well, Ross was mugged as a kid.  Oh yeah! What was his superpower again?  That\\'s it.  What?  Yeah?  So?  Oh my god!  Hey!  What are you doing?  No, that seems about right.  … that she was the huge guy that mugged you? Yah.  … everybody we know? Yeah.  Hey, let me tell them!  Joey is gonna be a celebrity guest on a game show!  Oh, that was our favourite game show ever!  Or \"Win, Lose or Draw\".  Oh, I can\\'t. We\\'re throwing Phoebe a bachelorette party.  Ross and I always wanted to be Donny and Marie.  Yeah, we used to perform for our family and friends.  Who is it?  Are you gonna be ok, officer, uhm,...  ...If-you-say-so.  Oh my God, this man is gonna get naked in my apartment!  Oh, no! I mean, obviously we want to see you take your clothes off! You big piece of eye candy!  Hey, you\\'ve got a boyfriend!  Look, there\\'s Chandler. You knew, that stupid friend of Ross\\'. Said I\\'m fat. You know I\\'ve already lost 4 pounds!  I KNOW!  Oh my God Rach. Bean bag chairs.  Do NOT let me sit in one of those. We\\'ll be here for days.  She and Phoebe took the stripper to the hospital.  What? When was this?  Oh my God! That\\'s wild!  Two guys in one night? Wow, I thought she became a slut after she got her nose fixed.  I was the pile of coats!  You were my Midnight Mystery Kisser?  You were my first kiss ever?  Oh, crap!  I know...God. I haven\\'t seen my savings take a hit like this since I was a kid and they came up with double-stuffed Oreos. What happened to all our money?  I guess with you doing the internship, we\\'re just spending more than we\\'re bringing in.  Oh, But you\\'re finally doing something that you love! I can\\'t ask you to give that up. Though it\\'d be nice if the thing that you love was y\\'know... finding gold.  Ok worse case scenario is...we borrow some money from my parents.  Why not?  Wow! I Had no idea you had this much pride.  Hey Joey!  Listen...I need to know that what I\\'m about to ask you, will never get back to Chandler.  But Chandler lent you money!  Come on...I just need it for some rent and..and some other bills.  Two thousand dollars?  Yeah...  Anyway erm, are you going to get a handyman to install this stuff?  You\\'re a pig. And you can\\'t do this.  Is that a bit you guys do?  We don\\'t do that! Tell her we don\\'t do that!  I hear wedding bells.  Don\\'t you mean..groomy?  I don\\'t want her to get a boob job! That\\'s crazy!  So you gave in and decided to call someone?  Thank you?  Ok, you\\'re being wierd. Do you want sex or did you do something bad?  Ok..You know the old classics you know,You look nice? They\\'re still ok.  Okay...  I know why do you think he was so worried about me getting bigger?  Oh my god. We\\'re trying to get pregnant so he\\'s probably starting to freak out about the fact that my body is going to change.  You heard him! \"No bigger!\" \"You\\'re perfect!\" \"Just don\\'t get any bigger!\" Oh my god he sounded just like my high school wrestling coach. You know what? I\\'m going to have to talk to Chandler.  Honey?  About that? Erm...I\\'m going to change.  I\\'m going to get bigger!  Well, my breasts are going to get bigger weather you like it or not! And you know what? It\\'s not just my breasts. My ass is going to get bigger too.  It\\'s kind of a package deal!  I thought I was something that we both wanted!  Joey, Chandler knows I borrowed the money.  How are you doing?  We took a cab. Did you guys walk?  Hey, you wanna see something?  Umm, this is going to be fun. Watch me freak out Chandler. Honey?  Listen uh, I-I’ve been doing some thinking, and I don’t know whether it’s because we’re here or Rachel’s giving birth but umm, I think we should try to have a baby.  What?! Are you kidding me?! You-you-you think we’re ready to have a baby now?!  Yeah but I was just screwing with you to try to get your voice all high and weird like mine is now!  That’s it! Right there! Is all I wanted!  Oh good God! If you want a baby so bad just go steal it!  What is going on with you? Since when are you so crazy about babies?  What?  We are pretty good.  Well maybe I’m ready now. I mean, it’s a little scary, but maybe it’s right.  What?!!  So we’re gonna try? I mean, are we trying?  Okay, hold on a sec.  Yeah.  Well, we could start trying. Now.  No, not here. Maybe here.  And it’s so clean!!  I think we found a place.  Umm, wait! Do you want to set the mood a little?  Okay! Okay! Make me sterile, but okay.  We could, or we can have sex in it.  Does that sound like Janice?  Hey!  I can’t believe this is taking so long. How are you doing?  Oh my God! She’s amazing. Oh, oh I’m so glad you guys got drunk and had sex!  What’s the matter?  It’s okay honey, you’ll find a name.  Yeah, I’ve had them picked out since I was fourteen.  Umm, okay. If it’s a boy it’s Daniel.  I don’t want to say.  Okay. It’s Emma.  Take it.  It’s clearly an Emma.  I know. Hey, do you realize we may have just changed our lives forever? We may have just started a family. Nine months from now we can be here, having our own baby.  Did I squeeze it too hard?  Is he doing his shark attack bit yet?  Get in there man! Flirt back, mix it up!  What happened?  No Joey, I think he\\'s just watchin\\' TV.  What?  Wow! For just a week you guys are really close, huh?  I know it is the best.  What? It\\'s still going on.  I-I am serious, I mean, we\\'re, we\\'re all over each other all the time.  Oh no, it is okay, I mean as long as you know that Chandler and I are also very hot and fiery, just as hot as you! I mean our flame, whew, is on fire!  Yes!  A kiss? What are you talking about?  He probably wants you back because you\\'re right for the job.  Phoebe, do you want to go see a movie after dinner tonight?  What are you doing?  Oh umm, that\\'s because I just wanted to y\\'know walk in on me and Chandler while we were, y\\'know, doing it all night. Will you excuse me for just a second?  \\'Cause, Gary and Phoebe think they\\'re a hotter couple than we are!  So! So we\\'ve got to go upstairs and have a lot of sex to prove them wrong!  Phoebe and Gary are so gonna hear about this at dinner.  We are the hottest! Huh? No one is hotter than we are! You\\'re the best.  No, you\\'re the best.  I am the best.  Why?  You better believe he\\'s tired, after the day we had! If you know what I mean. You know what I mean?  Phoebe, you have a, a twig in your hair.  You didn\\'t!  The park huh? A public place.  Hi Chandler.  Yes it is. You see I\\'ve always found the men\\'s bathroom very sexual. Haven\\'t you?  Come on, we can\\'t let them win!  Because Phoebe and Gary are in that-can\\'t-keep-their-hands-off-each-other-doing-it-in-the-park phase!  I feel really sad that we\\'re not…really there anymore.  Wasn\\'t it a lot more exciting when we were y\\'know all over each other all the time?  Really?  That is so sweet. I know that I was acting a little crazy but umm, I feel the same way.  Did not.  Okay, I freaked out a little.  Thank God! I can\\'t watch him anymore!  \\'Cause I was going by it the other day and I saw that there was a stock with my initials, MEG, on it and, well, sometimes I have to watch for two or three hours before it comes up again but when it does, it\\'s pretty exciting.  Really.  His indian name?  Wow.  Weird, weird.  Why?  It bit. It was a 50\\'s theme restraunt. I have to cook in a costume and dance on the counter. I mean I was a chef at Cafe des Artistes. I mean how could I take a job where I have to make something called Laverne and Curly Fries?  How can I not do it? I have $127 in the bank.  I don\\'t want a beer.  My stock, MEG, it went up 2 points. Hey guys, do you realize that if I had invested my $127 in myself yesterday that I\\'d like have...a lot more than that today. Ya know what, I\\'m gonna do it.  Put all my money in me.  I wanna buy 5 shares of SGJ and I wanna buy them now. C\\'mon time is money my friend. Thank you. Wooo.  Hey, I made $17 before breakfast, what have you done?  Well, my financially challenged friends, I split my money and I bought some shares of CHP and ZXY.  Well, CHP because I used to have a crush on Eric Estrada. And ZXY becuase I think it sounds zexy.  MEG was good for me but I dumped her. Ya know, my motto is get out before they go down.  DON\\'T...be too long with the phone.  I\\'ve gotta get back in the game.  I don\\'t know, I lost it all ok. I lost it.  Hey, I\\'ve come to terms with it, you have to too.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, where are we on the hundred bucks?  But I need it. Otherwords I\\'m gonna have to take that horrible diner job. You know, with the dancing and the costumes. I don\\'t wanna have to wear flame retardant boobs.  It\\'s so weird, how did Joey end up kissing Charlie last night? I thought you\\'d end up kissing Charlie.  Yes Rachel, why do you care so much?  Hey!  Hey, what\\'s this?  Oh, you can\\'t show Phoebe this! She hates those corporate massage chains.  Do you wanna go hunting?  And she wants to go hunting, too!!  Ok, trying to turn me on by making a mess? Know your audience! Besides, tomorrow we\\'re doing those fertility tests and until then you need to keep your tadpoles in the tank.  Honey, we\\'ve been trying to have a baby for over a year. I think it\\'s a good idea to find out if everything\\'s ok. Just a few routine tests.  What is the big deal?  It\\'s not ok to do it in a doctor\\'s office but it is ok to do it in a parked car behind a Taco Bell?  Look, I don\\'t wanna do this test either, but I really do think it\\'s a good idea!  Because, honey, I mean this in the sweetest way possible, nobody is gonna wanna watch that.  Hey, honey, my test is down the hall, are you sure you\\'re going to be ok?  I know this is embarrassing, but nobody cares! No one here even knows you!  Hey, we\\'re probably fertile, let\\'s go home!  So, what\\'s your name?  Hey sweetie.  What?  Oh... what does that mean?  Chandler?  I\\'m sorry too.  Why does my cinamon stick have an eraser?  Yeah, Chandler... you\\'ve been there for five years.  Well, what kind of food is he looking for?  Oh, I love my life, I love my life!  So great! He showed me where the restaurant\\'s going to be. It\\'s this, it\\'s this cute little place on 10th Street. Not too big, not too small. Just right.  So anyway, I\\'m cooking dinner for him Monday night. You know, kind of like an audition. And Phoebe, he really wants you to be here, which will be great for me because then you can \\'ooh\\' and \\'ahh\\' and make yummy noises.  I don\\'t know. I don\\'t know. It\\'s just going to be so great!  Is it better than the other salmon mousse?  Yeah, well, is that better?  It\\'s supposed to be that small. It\\'s a pre-appetizer. The French call it an amouz-bouche.  Oh, I asked one of the waitresses at work if she\\'d help me out.  Well... of course I thought of you! But... but...  But, you see, it\\'s just... this night has to go just perfect, you know? And, well, Wendy\\'s more of a... professional waitress.  Wendy bailed. I have no waitress.  Ten dollars an hour.  Twelve dollars an hour.  Hi Steve!  Oh, thank you. Would you like a tour?  I\\'m so glad you liked them!  Oh, well... um, that\\'s all there are of these. But in about eight and a half minutes, we\\'ll be serving some delicious onion tartlets.  You know, if you just wait another... six and a half minutes...  Give them to me.  No, give me the...  What?  Why? It\\'s just that I\\'ve waited seven years for an opportunity like this, and you can\\'t even wait four and a half minutes for a stupid onion tartlet?  I know... it\\'s just... I thought this was, you know... it.  Oh, I ordered mine first.  Give it to me.  Give it to me.  That\\'ll teach you to lick my muffin.  Had it.  Honey, you made the bed again. I told you, you don\\'t have to do that. This isn\\'t camp.  Baddest. Otherwise the song would be Fat Fat Leroy Brown.  Just waiting for you sweetie.  I\\'m sorry, I\\'m sorry. You know what, the way you did it was just fine.  If I tell you, you\\'ll think I\\'m crazy.  Ok, you see, the tag shouldn\\'t be at the top left corner, it should be at the bottom right corner.  I\\'m just easing you in.  Alright, you see these little flower blossoms? They should be facing up, not down, because, well, the head of the bed is where the sun would be. You don\\'t love me any more do you.  Really? Wow, well then come on, I wanna show you how to fold the toilet paper into a point.  You look fabulous honey, you really do.  It\\'s gonna be ok. Ryan\\'s been under water. He\\'s just gonna be so glad that you don\\'t have barnicles on your butt.  This is for the scratchy twins out there. I taped oven mits to their hands.  It\\'s for their own good.  Exactly. Oh, I love that I can be totally neurotic around you now. Tell me the truth. Don\\'t you like it better now that everything on your desk is perpendicular?  Very good.  You know what. Tomorrow I\\'m gonna do your clocks.  I\\'m gonna set them to my time.  No no. See, in my bedroom I set my clock six minutes fast. You wanna know why?  No forget it, I\\'m not gonna tell you now.  No. See you don\\'t understand.  No. You don\\'t have any of these cute little obsessive things.  Oh yeah.  Alright, well tell me one of yours.  What if they get mixed up?  You would not. I can\\'t believe this. I hate this, you\\'re too normal. I can\\'t believe my boyfriend doesn\\'t have a thing. My boyfriend doesn\\'t have a thing.  What\\'s up?  Yeah?  No honey. You have to sleep on this side of the bed because I have to sleep on this side of the bed.  No. Big deal, so you have a side of the bed, everybody has a side of the bed.  Alright, go on.  Oh my God, you\\'re a freak.  Mom says it\\'s all of Manhattan, parts of Brooklyn and Queens, and they have no idea when it\\'s coming back on.  Hello?  What?  I have no idea what you just said.  OK, I\\'ll go. OK, senior year of college... on a pool table.  Oh my God! What were you doing in a library?  You did not go!  Outside.  Why not?  And that would be?  Joey, what\\'s going on?  About what?  Oh my God! I love him!  My surprise party!  Oh stop it. Joey already told me.  No, you are not. We tell you stuff.  Hi!  Hi!  If you want, I\\'ll do it.  I can’t believe mom and dad are selling the house!  Well, after 15 years of mom and dad keeping it as a shrine to you, it’s time the velvet ropes came down.  Oh please! Dad turned my room into a gym 20 minutes after I moved out! I gotta say, a tanning bed and a stack of Victoria’s Secret catalogues, not a gym!  As much as they love you?  Hey!  That was me and Ross.  Oh that’s a great idea. You’re really good on the phone.  Oh, that’s okay, I can’t wait to see everything again! All of the memories…  I used to love to play restaurant.  Hey guys! Hey!  Hey, I just whipped us up some Easy Bake treats, they should be ready in about three days.  What?  Just mine?  So wait, Ross’s stuff is fine, but I have no memories because you wanted to keep the bottom two inches of your car away from water!!!  How do you think I am?! You’ve wrecked all my childhood memories. You love Ross more than me. And I just rubbed a dead mouse on my face!  Wait, you’re giving me your Porsche, you’re kidding me right?!  All right!  Do you guys know what happened to Chandler’s barca lounger?  Would you stop staring at her?  What\\'s the big deal with her? Maybe she\\'s attractive in an obvious kind of way.  Yeah. Hey, that was nice of you guys to back off and let Joey get the girl for once.  They\\'ve elected me to talk to you about the baby talk - it\\'s not so good.  Hey Rach!  Ready for your birthday lunch?  Pleased to meet you. So you\\'re coming to Rachel\\'s party tonight?  You were just being so nice to him!  Right there! That was so fake!  Oh, you\\'re welcome for the party. I\\'m glad you\\'re having a good time.  Does he?  Maybe he\\'s bothering you so much because he likes you. It\\'s like in first grade when Skippy Langwild always pushed me on the playground because he secretly had a crush on me?  Hey Rach, somebody got you shoes!  So this is what a stroke feels like.  Hey!  No way! You had your party, now I have mine! Is everything alright?  Oh, we weren\\'t talking about you. No, no way to recover.  Yeah!  We\\'ll try to be more careful okay? It\\'s just that, we don\\'t want everyone to know because this is going really well, and maybe the reason it\\'s going really well is because it\\'s a secret.  We are! Help us!  Joey!  Hey, Phoebe!  Phoebe, you are a bad ass!  Phoebe?  Yeah, the best you got in high school was Wet Pants Geller.  We\\'re so sorry.  Okay, just wait, please. I promise we\\'ll come up with something. Just give us a little more time.  I know.  Ross, are you okay?  Why?!  A pill?  Wait a minute, they\\'re making you take time off work?  It\\'s okay! It\\'s good! It\\'s good. It\\'s a disease!  Yes you are! That\\'s the only way to explain all this stuff!  Oh no!  Yes it\\'s true.  I guess I set up the video camera to try and entice Joey.  I\\'m Monica. I\\'m disgusting. I stalk guys and keep their underpants.  Do you realize this is probably the last time we’ll all be here in the coffee house as six single people?  Old?  That’s much better.  I’m making a list of all the things that are most likely to go wrong at the wedding. Now, that way I can be prepared.  Well, so far I have uh, my bride’s maids dresses won’t get picked up, my veil gets lost, or I don’t have my something blue.  I had to go with the odds Rach.  That other play?  Wait! Wait! Wait! You can’t start today! Today’s the rehearsal dinner!  Oh. Well then way to go you big movie star!  Who did we fight in World War I?  Honey, we gotta go!  Hey, do you realize that at this time tomorrow we’ll be getting married?  I just, I can’t believe that we made it!  I’m sorry but…nothing.  Well…honestly ever since we got engaged I have been waiting for something to, to flip you out.  Really?  What is that?  Mrs. Bing? Here, these are my parents umm, Judy and Jack Geller.  Hi Mr.…Bing.  It-it’s so great to see you both here.  Oh, Rach! Rach! Umm hey, could you do me a favor and would talk to Chandler’s dad and try to keep him away from Chandler’s mom?  He is the man in the black dress.  All right, I’m gonna go steam my wedding dress okay? Who wants the responsibility of making sure nothing happens to it?  Who wants it? Anybody?  Nobody wants to do it? All right, I’ll do it myself.  Y’know what? You’re right, I’m sorry. Actually you were a big help tonight. Yeah, and thanks for putting my grandmother in the cab and making sure she got to the hotel safely.  Hey! Okay, so I thought we’d start with my make up and then do my hair.  About what?  Yeah you will! The right guy is just around the corner! Okay, are we done with that?  Any woman would be lucky to have ya.  What?!  I can’t go to lunch!!  Okay, you’re-you’re really freaking me out.  How can that be?! Oh wait! Wait! Are you, are you serious?!  Oh wow! Okay. Don’t scare me like that okay? I mean for a minute there I was like, \"Oh my God! The worst has happened!\"  I wanna wear this everyday.  I know! Hey, how’s Chandler doin’?  Are you okay?  Well, you’re-you’re sweating.  Oh that’s sweet. Don’t touch me.  She’s right there.  Not now.  Chandler, for so long I…I wondered if I would ever find my prince, my soul mate. Then three years ago, at another wedding I turned to a friend for comfort. And in stead, I found everything that I’d ever been looking for my whole life. And now…here we are…with our future before us…and I only want to spend it with you, my prince, my soul mate, my friend. Unless you don’t want to. You go!  I do.  What baby?  We have a baby?  I didn’t take a pregnancy test.  Hey. Ross, did you know Mom and Dad are going to Puerto Rico for Thanksgiving?  Yes, they are. The Blymens invited them.  I am not wrong.  No, I just talked to them.  Oh, wow, so you\\'re gonna be one of those \"healthy, healthy, healthy guys\"?  Ok, I\\'ll tell you what. How about I cook dinner at my place? I\\'ll make it just like Mom\\'s.  And I assume, Chandler, you are still boycotting all the pilgrim holidays.  Phoebe, you\\'re gonna be with your grandma?  So you\\'re free Thursday, then.  Yeah. Rach, are you thinking you\\'re gonna make it to Vail?  Hey, Rach, did you make your money?  Rach, here\\'s your mail.  We all chipped in.  All right, that\\'s it. You know what? Just get out of my way and stop moping.  That\\'s not a question.  All right, fine. Tonight\\'s potatoes will be both mashed with lumps, and in the form of tots.  Ah!  What, Phoebe, did you whip the potatoes? Ross needs lumps!  Why would we do that?  Ok, three kinds of potatoes coming up.  Got the keys? or Got the keys!  Ok, right about now the turkey should be crispy on the outside, juicy on the inside. Why are we standing here?  No I don\\'t.  No I didn\\'t. I asked, \"got the ke-eys?\"  Well then get it, get it!  Can you go any faster with that?  Why do you guys have so many keys in there anyway?  I swear you said you had the keys.  Why would I have the keys?  But I didn\\'t.  Why?  Why?  Oh, really? So why was I busting my ass to make this delicious Thanksgiving dinner?  Stop it, stop it, stop it!  Ooh, Ugly Naked Dancing!  Make a wish?  Joey we know you steal our food.  Chandler there’s nothing wrong with crying! I mean you don’t have to be so macho all the time.  Yeah you’re right. I don’t know what I was thinking.  Where were your parents?  Poor thing!  You’re jealous of Princess Caroline?  Guys, what’s going on?  That’s Phoebe! Where did you get that?  This is so bizarre. I guess it kinda makes sense though, y’know she had such a terrible childhood.  Yes, but you are dead inside.  Wh-what, why?  Yeah you’re right, we can’t—we shouldn’t watch this.  Hold on a second! What is that on her ankle?  Hey sweetie!  Why are you reading this? You hate this kind of stuff.  Oh that’s so sweet! Look Chandler I don’t care if you can’t cry, I love you.  Stop it!  Yeah! And if, and if we have a baby one-day, and the doctor hands it to you in the delivery room and you don’t cry, so what! And-and-and, and if we take him to college and come home and see his empty room for the first time, and you got nothing, it won’t matter to me.  And-and-and if I die, from a long illness. And you’re writing out my eulogy and you open a desk drawer and you find a note from me that says, \"I will always be with you,\" and you still can’t shed one tiny tear, I know you’ll be crying a river inside.  What is wrong with you?!!!  What?! You can’t shed a tear for your dead wife!! Now, I left you a note from the beyond!  No you robot!!  No, I haven’t.  Oh my God! Are-are you crying?  Bye.  Hey, look at me. I\\'m making jam, been at it since 4 o\\'clock this morning.  Went down to the docks. Bet ya didn\\'t know you could get it wholesale.  Joey, take your time with that. That\\'s my last batch.  I figured out I need to charge seventeen bucks a jar just to break even. So, I\\'ve got a new plan now. Babies.  I\\'m talking about me having a baby.  Yeah. The great thing about the jam plan was, I was taking control of my life. So I asked myself, what is the most important thing to me in the world and that\\'s when I came up with the baby plan.  It took me 28 years to find one man that I wanna spend my life with, if I have to wait another 28 years then, I\\'ll be 56 before I can have a baby, and that\\'s just stupid.  I don\\'t need an actual man, just a couple of his best swimmers. And there, there are places you can go to get that stuff.  You\\'re gonna what?  What?! Why? Why is this crazy? So this isn\\'t the ideal way to something....  Lips moving, still talking. I mean it may not be ideal, but I\\'m so ready. No, I-I-I see the way Ben looks at you. It makes me ache, you know?  Joey, this is you!  Well, honey, it is pretty competitive. I mean I\\'ve got an actual rocket scientist here.  I think, that if you really like this guy, you should just trust him.  Oh, that\\'s what I would do, forget mine.  Hey.  To the bank.  Sperm.  Oh yeah, picked a guy, 37135.  \\'Fraid so. Brown hair, green eyes...  What?  Really? Why?  Hoyt?  Really, is he a swimmer?  We do not have one of those signs.  Two girls and a boy?  And, and, and they wear those little water wings, you know. And they\\'re, they\\'re running around on the deck. Then Hoyt wraps this big towel around all three of them.  Yeah.  Nothing. Just something I want to get Phoebe’s opinion on for Valentine’s Day.  Not really.  What is it?  Is this the video of the baby being born? Sweetie, this is Phoebe’s. Why were you even watching it?  Honey, what’s going on?  Mm-hmm.  Chandler, we can’t let this tape wreck Valentine’s Day!  Child-birth, it’s a natural thing! It’s beautiful.  Oh! Oh, my God! No wonder my mother hates me!  Don’t touch me!  How long has it been this time?  That’s better. 90 seconds is a long time not to think about it…except all I did was think about it.  Okay, well, we have to get past this! Why don’t we get rid of the tape and pretend it never existed?  Okay.  Oh, thank God!  Come in!  Oh, my God.  Rach, you know that birthing tape you wanted to see? It’s here.  No, but I will leave a sweater that smells like me right next to you!  She’s right…of course not. Honey, get the tape.  It’s…still beautiful.  I know! I know, I’m so sorry for you!  Oh, look at those little fingers and toes!  Oh…Rach!  Hey, this afternoon you said you\\'d be supportive...  I know, but what are we gonna do? She really needs this job.  How is that gonna happen?  You mean the guy who kept calling you Ron?  Hey Phoebe. Hey, tell me what you think. All right. The house next door to the one that we\\'re buying in Westchester? Just went on the market. I wanna take a look at it, but Chandler doesn\\'t.  But what if it is better than ours? Should we at least look?  That\\'s terrible!  Joey\\'s gonna be *so* upset.  Seriously, you don\\'t think we should tell him?  What if he reads it in the paper?  Hi. We’re buying the house next door, and we were wondering if we could just take a look around.  Thanks.  Ours is so much better! This living room is smaller, the dining room looks like a cave! What a hole!  Love it!  They could be our neighbors, what are they like?  Okay, the realtor said another couple made an offer. Maybe the Janice\\'s won\\'t get it! Maybe the other couple will.  Okay, you come up with an idea.  But we love our house.  W-wait. What is that?  No, no, I don\\'t.  Ross, is he gonna live with you, like, in your apartment?  Why don\\'t you just get a roommate?  So, how\\'d it go?  So what are you gonna be?  I think it\\'s romantic.  What?!  Yeah, but Janice? That-that was like the worst breakup in history!  Ross! He\\'s playing with my spatulas again!  Do you always have to bring him here?  I\\'m sorry, okay. It\\'s just that Chandler has somebody, and Phoebe has somebody- I thought I\\'d ask Fun Bobby.  Yeah.  What\\'s the matter?  Vividly.  Hi.  That thing is not coming in here.  I\\'m guessing your new girlfriend wouldn\\'t urinate on my coffee table.  Alright. Just keep him away from me.  Oh my gosh! Rachel, honey.. are you okay? Where-where\\'s Paolo?  Hey everybody! It\\'s Fun Bobby!  Not everybody\\'s happy. Hey Bobby!  So I\\'m kissing everyone?  We haven’t eaten yet!  Well, maybe you could give to somebody else. Ooh, like Ross Geller.  Who cares? He works in a museum!  Oh my God, ice just got in my eye!  Oh, y’know what, I can’t, it really kills.  No, my eye doctor is Richard! I can’t go to him when I don’t have a boyfriend!  Yes!!  Oh my God! How cute is the on-call doctor?  Oh no-no-no, not Dr. Burke. Dr. Burke is out of town. The-the on-call doctor will see me now.  I was probably waiting for it to open.  You look great too.  So how does it look?  Like a pirate?!  Oh. Big family dinner tonight?  No way!  I know.  Why is it sick?  Hey, come on, Phoebe, you understand don’t you?  Me going out with Richard’s son.  Thank you. Come meet my friends. This is uh, Phoebe.  And Joey.  My brother, Ross.  Umm, well, he’s…  All right everybody, this turkey is ready!  Here, let me show you. Okay, the towels are hanging next to the sink, and umm, you can use the fancy soap.  See he’s nice. Right?  Oh-ho-ho, we’ve got company.  Thank you.  Y’know all my friends think this is weird.  I know! I mean it’s like me and your dad, that’s a totally separate thing.  We’re just two people who find each other very attractive. Right?  Nothing. Nothing.  No-no-no that was good, it was, that was uh, that was a goood kiss…  Yeah!  I know!  Oh, he’s catching up to her!  Yes, hi.  No leg-chewing for us sir.  That’s because he wasn’t invited because of the way he behaved at our engagement party.  Why did you do that?  Oh yeah, the Evander Holyfield phase. Oh man you were so hard up you practically came on to me.  Hey, I could’ve had you if I wanted you.  You and Mona are doing a holiday card together?  Like asking her to move in with you?  Making her a mixed tape?  All right. Have you said, \"I love you?\" You could say, I love you.  That is a slap in the face.  Hi Roger.  Rachel umm, I was just talking to this guy and I think he’ll have sex with you.  From the tequila factory?  Come here. I can breath through my mouth.  I promise. Hey, speaking of together, how about we send out a holiday card this year?  I just had the most amazing bath.  Wait, you like them with me.  Oh, baths are so relaxing!  How dirty do you think I am? I’m telling you, if you had some candles and some bubbles and some music, you would love it! It would take all of your stress away.  Boy, do I have a surprise for you!  No, but someone’s really not going to get over that idea, are they?  I drew you a bath!  Please, could you just try it for me? Come on, I used all my best stuff! I-I-I lit some candles. I put on some music. I used bath salts, plus bubble bath! And got you this little plastic Navy ship. So it’s a boy bath!  I swear, if you try it, you will love it!  Absolutely.  Bet I know how that discussion’s going to go.  I told you you were a bath person! Hey, when you get out, maybe I can give you a facial!  Hello?  You know what? I-I think I’ll wait out here.  What?  Okay, let’s talk about something else.  Well, I actually had the weirdest conversation with Joey. He was talking about rules and right and wrong and…  You did? What was he talking about?  Okay, he was talking about rules.  Umm, and looking at people differently.  What did he tell you?  Okay. So you, me and London. Looking at people differently. Maybe he wants to do what you and I did in London with someone.  Wait a minute! He stopped talking the minute Phoebe came in!  And Phoebe is his friend, so he thinks that would be breaking the rules!  Why would I say anything? That two of our best friends could start the greatest love affair of their lives! And they would have me to thank, and we could all start having babies?  Oh, you had that?  I thought I lost it. I got a new one, like, a month ago.  Nothing.  I mean, I-I, I really shouldn’t say. I mean, I’m really not supposed to.  It’s a humdinger!  Somebody likes you!  No!  It’s Joey!  Is it something you’d be interested in?  I guess that makes sense. So, you think you’re going to talk to him?  Not Chandler, just Joey.  Hey.  Yeah, I’m going to take a bath. I’m just going to get a magazine.  What do you think you’re doing?  I know that you’re new at this, but this is completely unacceptable bath decorum.  Fine, you can have the bath, but I am taking your boat. Now you’re just a girl in a tub!  She pulled it out of me! She’s like a conversational wizard! How’d it go?  What?  Oh my God! A friend he’s looking at differently, but it’s wrong. It’s Rachel!  Honey, cover it up with the boat!  It sure is nice to do this together, isn’t it?  I’m not touching you.  It’s the salts.  Good morning, Tiger! I\\'m making you a nice big breakfast so you can keep up your strength for tonight. You\\'re gonna get me good and pregnant.  Well, I just lost my erection.  You\\'re supposed to find your passion in life. You can be whatever you wanna be now. It\\'s exciting.  Hey, wait a second. I can help you with this. You just need to be organized. We can make a list of your qualifications, and categorize jobs by industry. There could be folders and files!  I know!!! My erection is back!  Okay. Let us start with the A\\'s. Advertising.  Don\\'t you want to look through the rest?  You call eight hours alone with my label maker wasted time? Ooh, now I get to use my shredder!  I got one. \"Socks. Because your family\\'s feet deserve the best.\"  I actually know someone in advertising. I grew up with this guy who is a vice president at a big agency. Maybe I can get him to meet you? Give me the phone.  \"Marriage. It\\'s not for everybody.\"  We\\'re gonna have sex.  Let me put it this way. We\\'re having sex whether you\\'re here or not.  What are you talking about?  What!? You faked it?  You faked it? You couldn\\'t have faked it!  Guys can fake it? Unbelievable. The one thing that\\'s ours! Besides, why would you fake it when we\\'re trying to have a baby?  Like a month?  Really, you want to wait a year?  I really wanna have a baby.  No, I want you to have a job that you love. Not statistical analysis and data reconfiguration.  It\\'s just, I think, there\\'s never gonna be a right time to have a baby. I mean, now you\\'re unemployed and in a little while you\\'ll find a new job that\\'ll keep you really busy. There\\'s always gonna be a reason not to do this, but I think once the baby comes, forget about all those reasons.  It\\'s gonna be really scary. I mean, god. When we have a baby, there\\'s gonna be so much that we\\'re not able to control. I mean, the apartment\\'s gonna be a mess, I won\\'t have time to clean it. What if the baby gets into the ribbon drawer? Messes up all the ribbons?! What if there\\'s no room for a ribbon drawer, because the baby\\'s stuff takes up all the space!? Where will all the ribbons go!?!  Yes, please!  I wish I could say the same. I\\'m a little shook up!  Alright. Phoebe?  Hey, Joey, what would you do if you were omnipotent?  ..Excuse me?  How does she do that?  Would you look at her? She is so peaceful.  What\\'s going on with you?  Well, if you want, you can stay with Rachel and me tonight.  Oh, I was hoping you wouldn\\'t remember.  Wow, you worked in a mine?  Yeah, yeah.  Weeeell, it\\'s rum, and-  Uh, Rach, it\\'s the Visa card people.  That is the unusual activity. Look, they just wanna see if you\\'re okay.  You should feel great about yourself! You\\'re doing this amazing independence thing!  Ah, the other Jack.  So what, you\\'re not the only one. I mean, half the time we don\\'t know where we\\'re going. You\\'ve just gotta figure at some point it\\'s all gonna come together, and it\\'s just gonna be... un-floopy.  ...Pheebs?  Phoebe?  Do you have a plan?  Wait, was this a-a small mediterranean guy with curiously intelligent good looks?  Was he wearing a stunning blue suit?  I see pizza!  White House adviser? Clinton\\'s campaign guy? The one with the great hair, sexy smile, really cute butt?  Please tell me it\\'s his mother.  Oh, no...  Light still out?  Oh. Maybe they\\'re- napping.  I think he\\'s shy.  Yeah. I think you have to draw him out. And then- when you do- he\\'s a preppy animal.  Okay. Okay, I got one. Do you remember that vegetarian pate that I made that you loved so much?  Well, unless goose is a vegetable...ha haaaah!  What?! You slept with Jason?  Oh, that\\'s nice!  Excuse me?!  Really. Well, at least \\'big girls\\' don\\'t pee in their pants in seventh grade!  Where?  Oh, George, baby, drop the towel!  Could\\'ve played Monopoly, but nooooo.  Sorry, let’s go back! ‘Cause you’ve got more to say.  It was so wild! We told ‘em we were the Gunderson’s in 16…  What are you doing?!  Oh geez! Okay! Thanks!  Well, it was good to see you too. Did you come down here to tell me that?  Are you saying that you don’t want to get with this?  Joey?  Oh what are doing?!  I think you got it!  I\\'m sure everything\\'s fine. Has her water broke yet?  Joey, what are you gonna do when you have a baby?  What\\'s with the guitar?  I want a baby.  Get up. Come on. Let\\'s get some coffee.  No fair. I don\\'t even have one. How come they get two?  Oh yeah? When?  Why won\\'t I be married when I\\'m 40?  Ok, hypothetically, why won\\'t I be married when I\\'m 40?  What is it? Is there something fundamentally unmarriable about me?  Well?  Did you go home and change?  No, I haven\\'t seen him.  I\\'m sure they\\'ll be here soon.  Hi.  Can we come in?  Ross, can I?  He is so amazing.  Oh, okay. No problem.  Okay.  Here you go.  Okay.  What?!  Phoebe! You kinda caught me at a bad time.  Yes! Exactly.  Phoebe, I can explain!  Well umm, Alexandra has been…  Phoebe, don’t get upset!  No, it doesn’t say where it came from. Where would we return it?  Why don’t we just find a place for it?  No! That’s where we keep the canned goods! Have you completely forgotten everything you learned at orientation?  Oh, okay. Here, why don’t you let me do it?  No reason. I-I keep private things in there.  Feminine stuff.  Chandler, there is nothing in there that concerns you! If you love me you-you’ll let it go.  Well it’s…I mean I’d just—I’d be self-conscious. You’re my friend; I’d be naked.  That’s different, we were roommates! And when?!  Hey, come on Phoebe, you can understand why this would be weird for me.  Okay, if it means that much to you…  Dinosaurs.  Yes.  Nice! Wow Phoebe you are good!  No. Ooohh…  Hey.  I gotta tell you, yesterday was amazing. That massage felt so good!  So umm, what do you say we make it a weekly appointment?  Okay.  What?  What’s going on?  What?! You’re crazy! There’s nothing sexual about the noises I make!  Oh my—This is so embarrassing. Oh my God, I’m never gonna get massaged again!  Really?!  Are you sure?  I guess.  Oh no! You weren’t supposed to see this!  Really? You promise you won’t tell anyone?  Well…it’s just umm…I’m afraid you might mess it up.  Ohhh.  Ohh. Oh! Ohh!  Oh God!  Oh yeah right there!  Uh Phoebe?  Hey!  Yeah, well he’s my brother! And plus he drives so slow he could never hurt it.  Whatever Ross! Just replace the bulbs in the brake lights after you’re done.  Nice work everybody! So much for the y’know, \"You can drive it, but don’t tell Rachel\" plan!  Great! Well Rachel, the reason why I won’t let you drive the Porsche is because you’re a terrible driver. There! That wasn’t about the wedding.  Chandler, we still haven’t gotten an RSVP from your dad.  Chandler! He’s your father; he should be at the wedding.  Well what are you gonna do when he finds out he wasn’t even asked?!  So what! As long as he’s not wearing a white dress and a veil I don’t care.  It’s your suitcase. We’re going to Las Vegas.  We’re going to Las Vegas to see your dad. It’s time you two talked, and I want to get to know my father-in-law.  No you didn’t. Oh and honey just so you know, now that you’re marrying me, you don’t get to win anymore.  Chandler, look I-I know that your dad embarrassed you. I know…  Hey, the point is that he was at everyone of your swim meets and he was there cheering you on! Okay? That’s a, that’s a pretty great dad.  Who’s Mr. Girabaldi?  Chandler, you’re not fourteen anymore. Okay? Maybe it’s time that you let that stuff go. If your father’s not at your wedding…you’re gonna regret it for the rest of your life.  Yes!  How much did ever really win before?  I still say that if we had called your dad we coulda gotten better seats.  Why not?!  What?!  That can’t be your father.  What?  Can we have our drinks please?! Waiter—Uh, tress!  I’m-I’m Monica.  New York.  Hey.  I just talked to Joey, I just—I want to see how you were.  All right, I know you’re hurting, and-and I want to be supportive, but don’t say that again.  Honey, I don’t think that’s something we need to worry about! First of all he’s-he’s never gonna tell her how he feels about her. And even if he did you have no idea how she’d react.  Joey…he’s not even thinking about going after Rachel!  No! All he’s thinking about is how you’re taking this! I mean, listen it’s totally freaking him out. He’s talking about moving to Vermont.  Honey I can’t even imagine how hard this must be for you. But, I don’t want you to lose Joey over it. And right now he just needs to know that you’re still his friend.  All right. Now do it soon, he just asked me how to convert his dollars into Vermont money.  Hi!  So, what have you guys been doing?  I know! What is this, 1985?!  Not really.  So Don, what-what other restaurants do you like?  Oh my God! That’s my restaurant, I’m the chef there.  No!  Oh, I’d like a latte. Oh y’know what? If you’re gonna talk about me, I’m gonna go with you.  Me too! Yeah, Chandler can’t stand it. He won’t even allow me to have blue cheese in the house.  I’d move in tomorrow!  I’d like to have Don and Phoebe over. Wouldn’t that be nice?  Are you okay? You’ve been acting weird all afternoon.  Jeez! What is with you?  All right, what’s going on?  Chandler, you don’t believe in soul mates?  I don’t believe in soul mates either.  No. I don’t think that you and I were destined to end up together. I think that we fell in love and work hard at our relationship. Some days we work really hard.  No, I’ve had second thoughts about that. Do you realize how hard that would be to clean?  I know.  Oh yeah, I remember mine! Ohh, it was my sixth birthday, my dad took me to the park, I got it, and…it bent.  Did the girl ever let you ride it?  Making holiday candy for the neighbors.  See? This is exactly why I’m making this candy. We can learn their names and get to know our neighbors.  Where you can make out with your assistant.  Oh yeah, what’s the plan?  Wow! It took you all night to come up with that plan?!  Did you two…  Matt Guire, Mark Lynn, Ben Wire…  Okay.  The basket is totally empty! My God, the neighbors ate all the candy!  Joey!!  Did you eat all the neighbor candy?!  Ross! The neighbors ate all my candy!!  Hi. Do you know what time it is?  Umm, listen I am sorry, but I’ll put some out first thing in the morning.  Um-hmm.  Ross! That is so sweet of you to get Phoebe that bike! When I heard the story, I almost cried.  Oh yeah! I saw her walkin’ it down the street the other day. She had uh, these flowers in the basket. It was so cute.  Umm, can we see you ride it?  No kidding, out of towners huh? What did you tell ‘em?  Some people have been saying its y’know little drops of heaven, but whatever.  Hmm?  But they like it!  Maybe.  Well, they’re just gonna have to wait aren’t they? I’ve only got two hands!!  No! You don’t know the system! There’ll be nobody messing with the system!  Did you smoke?  I’m fine now, but it was really scary there for a while. I mean, someone slipped a-a threatening note under the door.  What do you do with your money now?  Joe... Emus are birds. You raise them for meat.  My dad told me. They play golf together.  Wow, the boyfriend\\'s parents! That\\'s a big step.  They just gonna love you, just be yourself.  I\\'m sorry honey, but we\\'re gonna take you shopping. It\\'s gonna be fine.  You went out with Wallis Pincer?  I knew you didn\\'t get a 1400!  So you stole that tape from Richard\\'s apartment?  Why in the world would you take this tape and and why would you watch it?  Is all this about you not being able to grow a moustache?  Isn\\'t that sad? I mean, can you see how pathetic that is? You shouldn\\'t be jealous. You should feel bad for him.  Chandler, this is not our problem. We\\'ve got each other. That\\'s all that matters.  THAT\\'S NOT ME!  I-It\\'s just so insulting! Big spring for a new blank tape, Doctor!  I can\\'t believe you\\'re not gonna be here for Christmas.  It\\'s so unfair, you don\\'t even like your job!  It\\'s just... It\\'s hard enough not seeing you during the week, but for Christmas... alright, if this is what you have to do, I understand.  No!  Come on Ben.  Okay Ben, why don\\'t you come open some more presents, and Santa, the Armadillo and I have a little talk in the kitchen? There\\'s a sentence I\\'d never thought I\\'d say.  Yeah, is that okay?  No.  Hi Honey! We\\'re all here; we just want to wish you a Merry Christmas.  So is it horrible? Is everybody working really hard?  Wendy? -- That sounds like a girl\\'s name.  Umhmm, umhmm, about the time you told me about New Year\\'s Eve. Where is everybody else?  Ohh, you are such a good boss! Is she pretty?  What does she do there?  She did WHAT?  *What*??  Alright, well, maybe I should let you and the second prettiest girl in Oklahoma get back to work.  Okay.  Okay!  Merry Christmas.  Really?  Well, not anymore.  I know, I just thought it would be fun.  Drunk enough that I know I wanna do this. Not so drunk that you should feel guilty about taking advantage.  Okay!  This doesn\\'t feel weird!  You\\'re a really good kisser.  Hm-hmm!  Wow! You are really fast!  We\\'re gonna see each other naked.  Do you wanna do it at the same time?  One!  Two!  Eh, we weren\\'t that close anyway!  Well uh, you and I are just goofing around, I thought, why not just goof around with him.  I think you\\'re better than you think you are.  I can\\'t get married until I get something old, something new, something borrowed, and something blue.  You\\'re so efficient. I love you!  No-no-no, wait! We need something old!  That\\'ll work!  Okay, now we just need something borrowed!  That\\'s stealing!  Listen umm, I\\'ve been thinking, it\\'s not fair for me to ask you to spend all of your money on our wedding. I mean, you work, you work really hard for that.  Eh, you work for that.  You do?!  You thought about that?  How many kids were we gonna have?  What else did you think about?  No, I want everything that you just said. I want a marriage.  Uh-hmm.  \"Wendy\" is a fat girl name.  Okay, fine. Let\\'s talk about snow. -- Do you think it\\'s snowing in Tulsa, where my husband is having sex on a copying machine?  What are you doing here?  But I thought if you left, you get fired.  What?  Oh my god!  No, I think that this is what you wanna do, I think it\\'s great!  Honey, we have been through this before!  You serious?!  Really?!  I am so glad you said cooks.  You got it from Pottery Barn?!  Rach, Phoebe hates Pottery Barn.  Yeah, she hates all mass produced stuff. She thinks her furniture should have a history, a story behind it.  It’s gotta be one of a kind. Y’know like umm, y’know uh, what’s that God awful ceramic fruit bowl she has on her counter?  I’m telling—If you put that in her apartment you’ll never hear the end of it.  I am so glad you guys got together, Chandler and I are always looking for a couple to go out with and now we have one!  Yeah.  So do you guys gonna come over tomorrow? I’ll make that pasta thing I was telling you about.  Joey, you don’t have too!  Tomorrow!  Hey!  The dinner will be ready in twenty minutes. This is so exciting.  What happened to Janine?  Joey! Why is Janine not coming over for dinner?!  Ugh, I can not believe this! I mean, who is she to judge us? We could not have been nicer to her!  Of course we will, come on we gotta make dinner.  I am loud!  Chandler, would you like some more orange juice?  We owe you?!  Don’t worry about it.  Absolutely!  What did I tell you about the hall?!  Well, I know that would make Joey happy, so, I would like that too.  Okay.  I cannot believe you broke up with her just like that.  So how was Joan?  How many perfectly fine women are you gonna reject over the most superficial insignificant things?  Hello, Mr. Heckles.  We\\'re not doing anything.  Ok, Mr. Heckles, we\\'ll try to keep it down.  Stop with the broom, we\\'re not making noise.  Mr. Heckles.  That\\'s terrible.  What can we do for you?  Well, what about his family?  I can\\'t believe that this whole time we thought he hated us. I mean, isn\\'t it amazing how much you can touch someone\\'s life, without even knowing it?...Would you look at this dump? He hated us. This is his final revenge!  Rache, I think we have enough regular lamps.  It doesn\\'t go with any of my stuff.  You don\\'t have any stuff.  No.  Mmmmm.  Hey, Rache. You know what we haven\\'t played in a while?  Hide the Lamp.  Did you know I was allergic to shellfish?  Ok, all right. It was an accident, I swear, all right. I was putting on my jacket, and the thing, and the lamp, and it broke.  Phoebe, tell her!  Chandler, you\\'re not gonna die alone.  You have got to get over this. You\\'re not gonna end up alone.  You are not a freak. You\\'re a guy.  Wait a minute, wait a minute. Yes he is. You are totally different.  No, honey, in a wonderful way. You know what you want now. Most guys don\\'t even have a clue. You are ready to take risks, you are ready to be vulnerable, and intimate with someone.  You made it!  No. Um, I know you like this, and I want you to have it. I think it\\'ll look good in our apartment.  That\\'s fine.  Oh, gosh, this is so weird. I mean, his whole life was in this apartment, and now it\\'s gone. You know, I think it would be nice if we just took a few moments, for Mr. Heckles. I mean, he was kind of a pain, he was, but, he was a person. You\\'re all going to hell.  I have no idea. But look how much they spent!  I know. It\\'s just such reckless spending.  That\\'s me.  Ross, you\\'ve got to do something about the humping.  This woman\\'s living my life.  She\\'s living my life, and she\\'s doing it better than me! Look at this, look. She buys tickets for plays that I wanna see. She, she buys clothes from stores that I\\'m intimidated by the sales people. She spent three hundred dollars on art supplies.  Yeah, well I might be if I had the supplies! I mean, I could do all this stuff. Only I don\\'t.  Oh really? Okay, let\\'s compare, shall we.  Do I go horseback riding in the park? Do I take classes at the New School?  This is so unfair! She\\'s got everything I want, and she doesn\\'t have my mother.  This woman\\'s got my life, I should get to see who she is.  What d\\'you think?  Oh, no thanks, we\\'re just here to observe.  Okay, d\\'y\\'see anybody you think could be me?  Okay, I\\'m not getting this!  Did you ever feel like sometimes you are just so unbelievably uncoordinated?  Great. It\\'s gym class all over again.  Why don\\'t I just take off my clothes and have a nightmare.  Oh. Monica! ...Hi. I\\'m Mo- ...nana.  Yeah. It\\'s Dutch.  Um, Pennsylvania Dutch.  Y\\'know what? After you\\'re with this woman for like ten minutes, you forget all that. I mean, she is this astounding person, with this, with this amazing spirit.  It was so wild. We told them we were the Gunnersens in room six fifteen. Only to find out the Boston Celtics had taken over the entire sixth floor!  ...They threw us out! I was thrown out of a hotel! Me!  \\'Scuse me?  Nononononono. Think who you\\'re dealing with here. I mean, I\\'m not like you. I-I can\\'t even stand in front of a tap class.  What?  Right. Till I bought a blow dryer, then I was shunned.  Uh-huh.  Wow. Then I would definitely not recommend Mrs. Doubtfire.  Yo- hooo!  Monica and I just crashed an embassy party.  Water rules!  Nope. Going to the Big Apple Circus today.  No, it is me! Y\\'know, I\\'m not just the person who needs to fluff the pillows and pay the bills as soon as they come in! Y\\'know, when I\\'m with her, I am so much more than that. I\\'m- I\\'m Monana!  Helloooo? Yeah. Oh my God. Thanks.  They\\'ve arrested Monica.  Hi.  How are you?  Because... I\\'m Monica Geller. It was my credit card you were using.  I want you to know, it wasn\\'t me who turned you in.  No, thank you! You have given me so much! I mean, if it wasn\\'t for you, I would never have gotten to sing Memories on the stage at the Wintergarden Theater!  I just can\\'t believe you\\'re in here. I mean, what am I gonna do without you? Who\\'s gonna crash the embassy parties with me? Who\\'s gonna take me to the Big Apple Circus?  Well, not... worried, just... wondering.  Not necessarily...  Um, I\\'m not actually Amish.  Yeah, but at least I\\'m doing it!  Happy birthday!!!  It’s your birthday!  Chocolate-chip pancakes!  They all came from the list you handed out to us two weeks ago.  Rach, you’re in a great place in your life. Come on, you’ve got a great job! Good friends…  Well, doing nothing on your thirtieth is better than doing something stupid, like Ross.  I can’t believe you bought this.  All right Rach, for what it’s worth, I think that you’re doing great. I mean y’know let’s face it, no one handles this well.  Weren’t you asked to leave sonny?  Noo!!!  Noo!!  Really?! You promise?  Okay. I can do that.  Ross, just forget about it. This guy’s got you totally wedged in.  Yay!  Phil!  All you had to do was buy the card!  I-I-I wanna thank you all for coming. My family and my friends…  Phoebe, y’know why don’t we just go upstairs and have some birthday cake?  Oh man!  He’s gonna eat the cake!  What you guys don\\'t understand is, for us, kissing is as important as any part of it.  Absolutely.  Whose little ball of paper is this?!  Look , I\\'m sorry, guys, I just don\\'t wanna give them any more ammunition than they already have.  That\\'s because as far as my parents are concerned, Ross can do no wrong. Y\\'see, he\\'s the Prince. Apparently they had some big ceremony before I was born.  What?  You didn\\'t.  Wow. That is not a happy hi.  W-w-wh-... wha-... w-w-w-...  What does she mean by \\'involved\\'?  Curry.  I\\'m sorry, why is this girl going to call me?  No Mom, I don\\'t have a restaurant, I work in a restaurant.  Ross, could you come and help me with the spaghetti, please?  I know this is going to sound unbelievably selfish, but, were you planning on bringing up the whole baby/lesbian thing? Because I think it might take some of the heat off me.  What\\'s that supposed to mean?  No it\\'s not.  Chandler, you\\'re an only child, right? You don\\'t have any of this.  No.  Am not!  Boy, you are really not a morning person.  What kind of changes?  Oh, good luck.  That is sooo not true!  I just—I can’t believe that you think that you and Chandler know me and Rachel better than we know you.  Yeah.  Deal!  Ha-ha!  Aww, man!  That does not mean you know us better, I-I want a rematch.  Yeah! And the winner gets a hundred bucks.  Are you scared?  Ross will do it.  You guys! Do you realize that any minute now, Phoebe can be pregnant?  Same category?  Michael Flatley, Lord of the Dance!  No!!  I knew that! Rachel! Use you’re head!  Viva Las Gaygas!  You guys are dead, I am so good at lighting rounds.  Huh, wanna bet?  How about we play for more money, say 150?  You’re doing it again.  I’m just trying to spice it up!  I got it! How about, if we win, they have to get rid of the rooster?  Deal!  No! Steady as a rock! Now, are you with me.  Come on!  Come on!  Sandwiches!  Maurice.  And processing.  It’s umm, it has something to do with transponding.  That’s not even a word! I can get this! I can get this!  NOOOOOOOOO!!!!!  Man, I feel like I’m coming down with something.  How do you feel?  Really?! How much?!  Look Rach, we have to move. I mean if they had lost, we would’ve made them get rid of the birds. Right?  All right, look, I hate this as much as you, but if it makes you feel better, it’s all your fault.  Chinadolor Bong, come on, we steal that TV Guide every week!  Well?  It’s only been a couple of hours, so just give it some time.  Hey, Rach, can you give me a hand with this box?  I’ll take care of it.  I lost our mattresses.  Hey!  Hey, don’t mix those up, you could really ruin that lollipop.  Hey, we would still be living here if hadn’t gotten the question wrong!  I can’t find garbage bags!  What is it?!  I can’t believe we’re living here!  Great.  Oh, that\\'s there on the bottom, see the manager, Chandler Bing.  A salad? Really I, I could do something a little more complicated if you like.  You got it.  Alright, well I\\'m tearing the lettuce.  Oh-oh, no no don\\'t worry, I\\'m gonna wash it.  That\\'s your call.  Well, I thought that I would cut up the tomatos.  They\\'r alright.  No really, they\\'re OK.  Actually, I was gonna do them jullienne.  Yeah, I think that fifth shower actually got the interview off me.  Oh yeah, well there\\'s the possibility that I won\\'t make rent.  No no no, if I couldn\\'t pay you back right away then I\\'d feel guilty and tense every time I saw you.  Man, man that is sharp. It must have cost you quite a few debloons.  Hi.  So, what\\'s this.  Wow, that is a surprise. Just one little question, uh, why not Ross\\'s room?  Oh, God forbid.  Where have you been?  No, but that\\'s probably \\'cause I haven\\'t asked them yet.  Um, yeah, so uh, uhh, listen, I\\'m sorry I didn\\'t tell you this before but umm, I, I\\'m no longer at my job, I, I had to leave it.  Because they made me.  Anything larger back there?  You have dinosaur checks?  Nothin\\', nothin\\', hey you\\'re a cheapasaurus. I\\'m kidding, I\\'m kidding, thank you, I\\'m very greatful.  Oh, um, that was my bathing suit from high school. I was uh, a little bigger then.  Hey, you got me, put it in.  You know what this is, this is us getting ready for the prom.  Shut up, the camera adds ten pounds.  Oh, you look so great.  Oops.  Shoot, I think I got mayonaise on you.  Oh, dad, turn it off.  Dad, it is not. What\\'s with the red light?  Ya know, Roy saw Star Wars 317 times. His name was in the paper.  I just told Rachel that Roy touched my boob.  If you\\'re not going then I don\\'t want to go either.  I can\\'t believe you did that.  Mom, I\\'m hungry.  Alright.  Joey let me ask you a question. What does this light switch do?  Didn’t it drive you crazy to have a switch and not know what it did?  They wouldn’t have put it there if it didn’t do something! How can you not care?  Janice?!  How have you been?  Done?  This switch thing has been driving me crazy. So I turned it off and checked every outlet. Now, four of them don’t work. Which means, one of them has to be controlled by the switch. So, I plugged in things in all four of the outlets that-that make noise, so that way, when I turn it on I just follow the noise and find out which one it is.  He asked you out?!  Saucy!  Electrical plans for the building.  I know that switch does something, okay? So-so I went down to city hall and got these. All I had to do was pay $25 and wait in line for three hours.  Hi!  Oh, just some pictures I made and hung up. I thought they’d brighten up the place. They do don’t you think?  No-no-no, no!  I know that there’s no hole there, I just really liked that picture.  Okay, but there is a wire back there! I mean that switch is connected to something!  I just thought that if I could follow the wire I could find out what it did.  No. It disappears back there behind that baseboard. For a minute there, I thought it went downstairs.  But it didn’t. Say hello to Mrs. Chatracus.  All right. The super couldn’t figure out what it did. A $200 an hour electrician couldn’t figure out what it did. I’ve had seven pretty serious shocks. I officially give up.  I guess Joey was right, it does nothing.  You broke a little girl’s leg?!!  Maybe a Hello Kitty doll, the ability to walk...  No.  Don’t, don’t, don’t, don’t, don’t do this.  What?  No. No, just, just, just a couple more boxes. It-it-it’s no big deal, all right, I’m-I’m cool. You gotta help me out with a couple more boxes!  Christmas cookie?  Is this the one that I threw out last year?  Oh honey, is that ‘cause your Mom died around Christmas?  I\\'ll put a pillowcase over my head.  What\\'s up?  Yeah, you can hear everything through these stupid walls.  Wait a minute, I think Phoebe\\'s right. You know I hear someone else in there with him.  Oh my God, that\\'s Charlie!  I\\'m not sure about this.  No I\\'m not sure that it\\'s the best way to hear everything. Someone get me a glass!  What?  I can\\'t believe this. Rachel and Joey?  I\\'m on it!  I think I hear curtains closing...  Bedsprings, unmistakable!  Okay, I\\'ve had it with the hair jokes. Tomorrow morning, before we leave, I\\'m going to the salon.  Honey, if you know it through a wall, you know it too well!  Other wall, people! Other wall!  Yeah, but he wants to talk to you before anything really happens with her. And as his friend, I mean, don\\'t you think he deserves the same from you?  Check it out!  What do you think?  Don\\'t you just love it?  Yeah!  It\\'s \"Bolero\" from \"10\".  You what? You said you liked them.  Fine, so you don\\'t like them. Everybody else does.  And the eye!  Not really.  I have a problem.  Well, I was dancing around, and singing \"No Woman, No Cry\" and I got stuck.  Yeah, I tried to gnaw myself free.  Sure, what do you have in mind?  Really? I don\\'t really feel like it.  Okay, I just don\\'t get why you like it so much.  Then what\\'s the problem?  What, forget it!  Joey, you know, maybe your just not used to kissing men, maybe you just tensed up a little, maybe that\\'s what you need to work on.  Woo-hoo, stuud!  Woo-hoo, geeek!  Please!  What are you talking about? What wedding?  Nooo! Never! I mean, we\\'re living in the moment. God, it is so nice for once to not have to get all hung up on \\'Where is this going?\\'  Could not be more terrified.  Hey, you know I got a question for ya. Just a little thing, no pressure.  Did you ever, uh, like, think about the future?  Yeah, am I in it?  Oh God, you are about to get sooo lucky.  Keep talkin\\'.  Okay, so, uh, we\\'re in France, we\\'re making the toast. Do you see a little bassinet in the corner?  Not a basset, a bassinet.  Well, I just think the baby would keep falling off the dog. Do you, uh, do you , do you not see kids in our future.  Uh-huh.  That\\'s Great. You know we don\\'t need to talk about this now. Really, I mean this is, is so way, way, way, in the future, I\\'m talkin\\' hovercrafts and apes taking over the planet.  So, I read this article in the paper the other day that says you\\'re not supposed to throw rice at weddings, because when pigeons eat rice it kills them.  Oh, absolutely. Yeah, you know I\\'m not even thinking about that thing that we\\'re not supposed to think about.  Okay, one more, please. Come on, I\\'m gonna get it in this time, I will.  You\\'ll do what?  Oh my God!  Really?  You\\'re the most wonderful man. And if you hadn\\'t of said \\'if I have to\\' like seventeen times, then I\\'d be saying \\'okay, let\\'s do it.\\'  Oh my God, I can\\'t believe what I\\'m getting ready to say. I wanna have a baby, but I don\\'t wanna have one with someone who doesn\\'t really wanna have one.  Hi!  Oh that’s great!  I mean think about all the money that you’re gonna make!  Well, her father pays you for baby-sitting right?  Oh, I love museums!  Soakin’ up all the culture.  Where do you want to start?  Yeah!  What?! Are you crazy?! I’m not getting married! I’m not even engaged.  Well, I mean I guess there is no harm in putting my name down.  Phoebe, that stuff is…  Hi, honey.  What? I-I bought groceries, I was gonna make you dinner!  Oh no!  Oh please, he didn’t hear it! He didn’t hear it!!  NOOOO!!!!!!!!  Phoebe!  Have you seen Chandler?!  I know! I know! And he totally freaked out and I can’t find him anywhere!  Honey, we were at this beautiful place, and I-I-I just put our names down for fun! I mean, what’s the harm in that?  Chandler, please don’t think I was trying to pressure you. Phoebe and Rachel…  It was a mistake. Please don’t take this to mean anything, because it doesn’t.  Really?  I know! I know.  Hey! So what do you think?  I know.  I’m sorry, they just, they just look so good! And the saleswoman was looking at me like, \"Oh, these are way too expensive for you.\"  Hey.  They’re mine!  Honey, I’m not returning them. Okay? I mean I-I know they cost a lot, but I’m going to wear them all the time. You’ll see. Besides, I love the compliments. I mean, have you ever had something so beautiful everyone wanted it?  Nice try; I’m keeping the boots.  Hey guys!  See Chandler? I’m getting a lot of use out of them already! They’re very practical. See, you can wear them with dresses, with skirts, with pants…  The guy who made these hates feet and wants to see them die!  I can’t! I spent so much money on them and I told Chandler that I’d wear them all the time, I just can’t give them away!  I can’t do that either! The soles’ are already a little scuffed up and the insides are filled with my blood.  Honey, we don’t really have to go to this thing tonight do we?  I-I don’t-I don’t think that I’m gonna wear the boots tonight.  Well y’know, I’m just-I’m just worried that bosses will see them and think they pay you too much money. Or! Or your assistant will see them and-and want a raise!  Anyway, I picked up this outfit that I want to wear and the, and the boots don’t really go with it.  Fine! If you want me to wear the boots, I’ll wear the boots. In fact, I’ll go into my room right now and y’know try the outfit on.  Yeah! I didn’t know there would be dancing. That was a fun surprise!  Oh no, we can’t walk!  Hey! Do you think that we can get to the subway right there if we climb down through the manhole cover?  I can’t walk. Okay? Okay? These boots were a huge mistake!  Okay you were right! All right, I never should have bought them! They’re killing me! One toe at a time!  How are we gonna get home? Maybe a piggy-back ride?  My boots in tan! Hey! Can you get a little closer so I can see the price?  Okay, I’m sorry. I think I can walk the rest of the way now. Just-just give me my boots.  Well I don’t have them either. Where are they?  Okay, I’m never gonna wear them again. I just didn’t get a chance to say goodbye.  See, now this is why I keep notepads everywhere.  Oh, now you want a pad.  There it is. Joey, what are you doing?  What is it with you people! I mean, the minute you start to feel something, you have to run away?  Oh, you mean like that guy thing where you act mean and distant until you get us to break up with you.  That is never good.  Welcome to our side of the tunnel.  You know, when you start get screwed over all the time, you gotta switch to low-fat.  Well, no, not at all, you\\'re not terminal, you just, you just need some damage control.  She has to know that your not ready.  My God! Chandler, we said be \\'aloof\\' not \\'a doof\\'.  You know what, everything\\'s gonna be okay.  If-if-if we ever did what you did a man would never call.  Oh wait, you know what, I got it, I got it, pretend like you just woke up, okay, that will throw her off. Be sleepy.  What are you being such a weenie for? So he has a Barbi, big deal. You used to dress up like a woman.  Well, you used to dress up in Mom\\'s clothes all the time.  The big hat, the pearls, the little pick handbag.  How can you not remember? You made us call you...Bea.  Wasn\\'t there a little song?  \\'I drink tea.\\'  \\'....Won\\'t you, won\\'t you, won\\'t you.... \\'  It’s Chandler’s way of pretending he didn’t take mime.  Yeah sure, nature called, she wanted to see who else did.  You’re on the phone!  Oh well, it’s not so bad.  Isn’t that mine?  Hey!  Wow! So, now you’re going on a date with this girl?  You’re right, I’m sorry. It’s not like you’re y’know, going out with an ex-girlfriend.  You dated her!  All right, well why don’t I go out with an ex-boyfriend and do Joey a favor?!  Now, this is last minute so I want to apologize for the mess. Okay?  I know! Now look, there’s only one problem though. There’s only room for one, so I guess one of you will have to stay at Joey’s.  So Rach! You’re the first guest at Hotel Monica! Umm, you’ll just have to tell me how you like your eggs in the morning. And I thought I would bring them to you, y’know, in bed. Oh, you have been through so much.  Now there you go! I wouldn’t want my best guest to strain her eyes!  Does that smell bother you?  Well you let me know if you can, because y’know I can bake a pie to cover it.  Okay!  So it’s okay to date a student.  Well Ross, you be careful now. You don’t want to get a reputation as y’know Professor McNailshisstudents.  Joey that is so sweet.  What?! You’re going out with her again!  Joey! You didn’t even know her!  Hey! How’s it goin’?  Yes it has! I made cookies!  But you should eat them now because they’re hot from the oven.  Okay!  You’re kidding!  Ross!  Joey, why don’t you put them in the lost and found?  Oh my God, what a fun day! That sounds great!  Don’t worry about it Phoebe, we’ll absolutely do it.  Pheebs, how’s it going?  Nope, sound like me. Pheebs, it’s going great. Look at Chandler with little baby girl Chandler.  What do you mean?  This is so great! This is exactly how we set the plates at the restaurant.  Oh yeah, I got soap and sponges and rags and Carnuba wax and polishing compound.  I know. But umm, one time there was this really dirty car in front of the building, so I washed it.  And six others.  Yeah, two hours, a lifetime that’s the same.  Chandler, what are you doing? That thing can put someone’s eye out!  Oh it’s so cute. I wonder what age it is when you stop being able to put both legs over your head.  How are you still single?!  Good. What made you change your mind?  And people will think you own a Porsche because you’re wearing the clothes?  Joey, you know you don’t actually have one.  All right, that’s it, we’re going to the emergency room.  The babies are asleep, I’m sure you’ll be okay on your own for a while!  He’s got something plastic lodged in his throat, we’ve got to go to the hospital.  Oh my God.  Phoebe, what, what happened here?!  But my apartment!  But the mess!  You’re right, you’re right I shouldn’t freak out. ‘Cause this is what will happen when you and I have babies! When will that be?!  What are you talking about?  You were invited?!  My God, I can’t believe this! I mean I knew that mom and dad were invited, but I thought that was it! I mean from the ages 7 to 9 Frannie and I were inseparable!  Yeah, well you call her and tell her that y’know when we were kids her precious little Frannie tried to undress me several times, okay? And if I hadn’t have stopped her, there probably wouldn’t even be a wedding to go too.  Joey, that paper’s like a year old!  Hey.  Joan?  Wait a minute, you got Ross Gellar and guest?! I wasn’t invited and you got \"and guest?!\"  Wait a minute, y’know, you’re bringing me!  Why not?!  Because! She’s my cousin. I mean, we grew up together! We’re family y’know? Well that’s important to me.  David who?  Phoebe, can I talk to you for a second?  What are you doing?  So! He’ll understand!  God, you are so strong.  I’m Monica Gellar. Who do you know the bride and groom?  Used to work with her. Used to! I’m a relative and I didn’t get invited! A blood relative! Blood!!  Okay, you’re fine.  Frannie was the one who found your Playboys and showed them to mom.  Am I doing here? Why? Surprised to see me? Ross brought me. How do you like that?!  Oh wait I forgot my wrap.  Hi. Uh, my friend here was taking down our Christmas lights, and and she fell off the balcony and may have broken her foot or or ankle or something.  Okay, ooh, alright. Name, address... Okay, in case of emergency, call?  Really?  I have no idea, but X-rays alone could be a couple hundred dollars.  Well there\\'s not much we can do.  Hah, no no no no no no no no no no.  Uh, you left out the stupid part.  I think it\\'s totally insane, I mean, they work for the hospital. It\\'s like returning to the scene of the crime. You know, I say we blow off the dates.  Come on, she\\'ll be here any minute.  Oh...  Well maybe we can make a, a, a \\'B\\' out of one of those roses.  Rachel, the cute doctors are here.  Hi, come on in.  Hi, Geoffrey.  It\\'s uh...  It will not be fine. We\\'ll get in trouble.  A wuss? Excuse me for living in the real world, okay?  I said we are not going to do it, okay? Sometimes you can be such a, a big baby.  Sure, every time, you\\'re such a princess...  What?  What!?  Ross, he\\'s got the remote again.  I don\\'t know! Why don\\'t you just explain? What do they want? Find out what they want!  We forgot to sign one of the admissions forms.  Thank you.  Yes.  Hi.  What\\'s goin\\' on?  Michael.  Oh, look, he\\'s waking up!  What’s the charity?  Does Ralph mumble when you’re not paying attention?  Oh, I like Elizabeth.  Yeah. In fact, I like her so much you tell her I want my cookies early this year! Y’know, a box of Thin Mints and some Tag-a-Longs.  Well that is great. And seriously, she seems very nice.  Chandler, do you think we talk about our relationship enough?  Hey!  Yeah!  Well, uh y’know, our guy works with Chandler and he’s really nice and smart and he’s a great dresser!  You’re not supposed to look!  All right fine, your guy may have a great body, but our guy is really funny.  Our guy’s a great dancer!  Hey! How did it go with Elizabeth?  Well, spring vacation is doing nice things with your grandparents. Spring break you’re doing frat guys.  And slept with the professor.  Yes! We found you a really cute and funny guy from Chandler’s work!  Uh, would you stop it with that already?!  Are you funny? Tell us a joke!  All right guys stop it. Rachel, we’re very sorry that is a very insensitive thing for us to do. And y’know what? Let us make it up to you, we have two really great guys for you.  In 1981 you were 13!  Hey!  Hey!  We’re really glad you decided to meet our guy.  You’re gonna like him so much. So umm, when do you want to meet him?  Eldad, this is Rachel.  No! You can’t do that!  Rachel! Rachel! You haven’t touched Eldad’s hair!  That’s right Patrick, bye-bye!  There\\'s nothing to tell! He\\'s just some guy I work with!  Okay, everybody relax. This is not even a date. It\\'s just two people going out to dinner and- not having sex.  And they weren\\'t looking at you before?!  Are you okay, sweetie?  No you don\\'t.  Oh really, so that hysterical phone call I got from a woman at sobbing 3:00 A.M., \"I\\'ll never have grandchildren, I\\'ll never have grandchildren.\" was what?  A wrong number?  Rachel?!  So you wanna tell us now, or are we waiting for four wet bridesmaids?  Who wasn\\'t invited to the wedding.  Now I\\'m guessing that he bought her the big pipe organ, and she\\'s really not happy about it.  Well, I guess we\\'ve established who\\'s staying here with Monica...  Just breathe, breathe.. that\\'s it. Just try to think of nice calm things...  Okay, look, this is probably for the best, y\\'know? Independence. Taking control of your life.  The whole, \\'hat\\' thing.  Joey, stop hitting on her! It\\'s her wedding day!  Oh God, is it 6:30?  Buzz him in!  Maybe. Joey: Wait. Your \\'not a real date\\' tonight is with Paul the Wine Guy?  Yes!  Rach, wait, I can cancel...  Okay, umm-umm, I\\'ll just--I\\'ll be right back, I just gotta go ah, go ah...  Oh my God!  My brother\\'s going through that right now, he\\'s such a mess. How did you get through it?  -leg?  You actually broke her watch?  Wow!  The worst thing I ever did was, I-I shredded by boyfriend\\'s favorite bath towel.  What?..... What, you wanna spell it out with noodles?  Oh, so there is gonna be a fifth date?  Yeah... yeah, I think there is. -What were you gonna say?  I know being spit on is probably not what you need right now. Um... how long?  Wow! I\\'m-I\\'m-I\\'m glad you smashed her watch!  Stop!  We\\'ll talk later.  Shut up, and put my table back.  Yeah, we all have jobs. See, that\\'s how we buy stuff.  Oh wait, wait, unless you happened to catch the Reruns\\' production of Pinocchio, at the little theater in the park.  So how you doing today? Did you sleep okay? Talk to Barry? I can\\'t stop smiling.  I know, he\\'s just so, so... Do you remember you and Tony DeMarco?  Well, it\\'s like that. With feelings.  Big time!  I think we are getting a little ahead of selves here. Okay. Okay. I am just going to get up, go to work and not think about him all day. Or else I\\'m just gonna get up and go to work.  What for?  Hey Frannie, welcome back! How was Florida?  How do you do that?  You know Paul?  You mean you know Paul like I know Paul?  Why?! Why? Why, why would anybody do something like that?  I hate men!  I hate men!  Is it me? Is it like I have some sort of beacon that only dogs and men with severe emotional problems can hear?  I just thought he was nice, y\\'know?  How\\'d you pay for them?  And who pays for that?  C\\'mon, you can\\'t live off your parents your whole life.  All right, you ready?  You can, I know you can!   Rachel!  That was a library card!  Welcome to the real world! It sucks. You\\'re gonna love it!  You be okay?  That\\'s Paul\\'s watch. You just put it back where you found it. Oh boy. Alright. Goodnight, everybody.  See ya.... Waitwait, what\\'s with you?  What? I-I said you had a-  I said that you had a nice butt, it\\'s just not a great butt.  So, I\\'ll get candles and my mom\\'s lace tablecloth, and since it\\'s Rachel\\'s birthday, I mean, we want it to be special, I thought I\\'d poach a salmon.  What?  You wanna be in charge of the food committee?  Alright. If you guys don\\'t want it to be special, fine. You can throw any kind of party you want.  Ok, um so, I still have to invite Dillon and Emma and Shannon Cooper.  Joey that is horriable.  So what happened?  Well, how bout just her mom?  Cause I already invited her.  Ok, we\\'re not having birthday cake, we\\'re having birthday flan.  It\\'s a traditional Mexican custard dessert.  No no, the father can, but um, since I am the roommate I can tell you that she\\'s not here and I\\'ll pass along the message, ok. So bye-bye.  No, no, not a party. Just a surprise gathering of some people Rachel knows. Um, this is Phoebe and Chandler and Joey.  Chinese menu guy. Forgot the menus.  Sandra, I am so sorry, I thought you were Rachel and we just weren\\'t ready for you yet.  Oh my God, oh my God, oh my God.  So uh, Joey and Chanlder, I, I think it\\'s time that you take Dr. Greene over to your place.  Because that\\'s where the party is you goon. See this is just the staging area.  Ok, everybody, there\\'s food and drinks on the table. Go across the hall.  Right now, Joey and Chandler\\'s, go now.  Just go.  Ok people, I want you to take a piece of paper, here you go, and write down your most embarassing memory. Oh, and I do ask that when you\\'re not using the markers, you put the caps back on them because they will dry out.  No. No you can\\'t go. No this is fun. Come on we\\'re just getting started. Here, here\\'s your marker.  Ok, the first person\\'s most embarassing memory is, \\'Monica, your party sucks.\\' Very funny.  Could you guys please try to keep it down, we\\'re trying to start a Boggle tournament.  You, and you, you\\'re supposed to be at my party. And Gunther! What are you doing here?  Phoebe.  Ok, thanks for coming, I hope you guys had fun.  Ok will do. So glad you came.  Ok, let me go check. Your mom want\\'s to say goodbye.  Thank you.  Ok everybody, it\\'s time for flan.  Ok, that\\'s enough.  Okay, you can not tell Chandler. Okay? That I ran into Richard.  The Richard.  Noo! My ex-boyfriend Richard! Y\\'know the tall guy, moustache?  It was, it was really nice. We started talking and I-I ended up having lunch with him.  Really?  The strange part was, he was really nice, umm and he looks great, but I didn\\'t feel anything at all!  Because it would totally freak him out and tomorrow\\'s our anniversary. I just don\\'t want anything to spoil that.  I know.  What?  It\\'s almost our anniversary!  I got you a present!  For this weekend! Oh gosh, it would be perfect, we get to see Joey plus we get to start our anniversary celebration on the plane. We can call it out plane-aversary.  No.  Oh, he just doesn\\'t want us to go through any trouble. Think of how excited he\\'ll be when we go out and surprise him! Plus we get to have our own, ani-Vegas-ary! A-Nevadaversary!  But we can go, right?  Okay!  Ditch you? Phoebe, you were pregnant with the triplets!  Aww! I love you!  Okay!  I love the \"I forgot the present\" fake out!  Oh that\\'s okay. Don’t worry about it, you can give it to me when we get back.  Okay, I umm, I ran into Richard yesterday and he asked me if I wanted to go for a bite and I did. The only reason I didn\\'t tell you is because I knew you\\'d get mad and I didn\\'t want to spoil our anniversary.  Really?!  Great!  Phoebe, you don\\'t eat animals.  Who are you talking too?  I\\'m so sorry.  I knew you were not okay with that.  It meant nothing! Okay? After all this time, how can you not trust me?  You\\'re right. I\\'m sorry. I should\\'ve told you.  I promise you, next time I will absolutely tell you.  I can not see him? I mean, you can\\'t tell me what to do!  Oh y\\'know what? If you\\'re gonna be acting like this all night, I really, I don\\'t even want to be around you.  Fine! Happy Anniversary!  No it is not!  I can\\'t believe this! This is like the worst night ever!  This is crazy! I mean, it\\'s such a stupid argument. I don\\'t even wanna see Richard again.  Hmm.  Wait Chandler, what are you doing?!  Not any more.  Yeah, I couldn\\'t be mad at him for too long.  We have one.  That\\'s right baby! Okay, what do I want now?  Pick a number! That is your only job!  Thank you!  Yes!  Okay, good! Okay, what do I want now?  What?  Oh, that\\'s because I had lunch with Rich—Me neither! Okay, what do I want now?  Hard 8?! We should call it easy 8!  Shut up!! It just got interesting!  What did you just say?  Are you serious?!  I\\'ve never loved anybody as much as I love you.  Okay!  That could be a four or a five. It\\'s your call.  I think so too.  Okay, come on, I can\\'t get married until I get something old, something new, something borrowed, and something blue.  You\\'re so efficient. I love you!  No-no-no! We need something old!  That\\'ll work!  Okay, now we just need something borrowed!  That\\'s stealing!  Yep, we wanna get married!  What are you doing?  No, only because that\\'s the graduation song.  Are you sure you wanna do this?  I can\\'t believe you married Duncan. I mean how could you not tell me? We lived together, we told each other everything.  Of course I wouldn\\'t approve, I mean, you were totally in love with this guy who, hello, was gay. I mean, what the hell were you thinking?  Please, when he left town you stayed in your pajamas for a month and I saw you eat a cheeseburger.  Well, didn\\'t you?  I can\\'t believe you didn\\'t tell me.  What have I not told you?  Oh it\\'s not big, not at all, you know, kinda the same lines as, say, oh I don\\'t know, having a third nipple.  That is wild.  Look honey, I wanted you to hook up with Ross as much as you did. But he\\'s with her now and you\\'re just gonna have to get over it.  I can\\'t believe you\\'re dressing up for him. I mean, you\\'re just, you\\'re setting yourself up all over again.  Hell, I wanna see Joey.  All I say is, she better get the job.  You know, it still smells like monkey in there.  Rachel, that\\'s all we do.  So the wedding caterer sent me this list of twelve appetizers and I have to narrow it down to six.  Chandler.  I will.  No, I’ll do it. You just stick to your job.  There were only twelve.  What are peanut butter fingers?!  This is it. Yeah, this is the one. I can’t believe I found it!  Well I’m Monica Geller, ball like a baby.  Have you found your dress yet?  No, I can’t afford this either. No. I-I-I’m, I’m just to figure out which one I want then I’m gonna get it at Kleinman’s, this discount place in Brooklyn, day after tomorrow they are having a huge sale.  Yeah! So-so when are you getting married?  Oh May 15th.  Yeah!  Jeffery.  The best man? Wow!  Oh, my fiancee wants the Swing Kings.  All right.  Megan!  You came?!  This is my dress!  Yes it is! You saw me wearing it!  What? You freak! You wouldn’t even have known about this place if it wasn’t for me!  Oh…  That was that girl Megan! She booked the Swing Kings on the day of our wedding and said that I couldn’t have them back unless I gave her the dress!  What am I gonna do?! That is the dress! That is the dress! Wh…Chandler wants the band. What do I do?  How?  Phoebe, he’s gotta be in the room for that to work.  Well umm, we were just talking about the y’know, the Swing Kings and just wondering whether y’know, they were the right way to go.  Oh crap!  No! We only mess around at his place!  No, I’m wearing a wedding dress.  Yeah but I’m not keeping it.  Oh. I guess you can. Okay but; I-I have to return it, so you can’t like it.  Really?  Oh because it doesn’t…really fit. Oh by the way, I-I booked the Swing Kings.  Okay! But you can’t rip it. Well, maybe a little.  All right? What’s going on?  I would get a room with this cake. I think I could show this cake a good time!  Oh, I\\'m sorry honey, you know, but when she said \"sex\" I wasn\\'t thinking about \"sex with you\"!  Hey! You smell like perfume and cigarettes.  Nancy doesn’t smoke!  So? What do you think of the house?  Isn’t it? Then what about the amazing wainscotting and the crown molding and the dormer windows in the attic?  Don’t you love the huge yard?  And Nancy said that it\\'s really under price, because the guy lost his job and has to move in with his parents!  So? Do you think we should get it?  I think we should.  This is huge!  How bad you wanna smoke, right now.  Gotcha. When do we tell them about this?  Okay. Right. Oh my God that is gonna be so hard.  If only there were a smaller one to clean this one!  No, he’s picking up dinner, why, what’s up?  What?  Oh my God! Oh my God that’s awful! What did you think of the house?  Uhm, she has been showing us houses outside of the city.  When we found out that we\\'re gonna get this baby, Chandler and I started talking and we decided that we didn\\'t want to raise a kid in the city.  And that\\'s great for you guys, but we want a lawn and a swingset...  And about an hour ago, we made an offer.  Well, I guess we\\'ve established who\\'s staying here with Monica...  Okay, Rachel, you wanna put the marshmallows in concentric circles.  Every year.  I got it! How about, if we win, they have to get rid of the rooster?  Deal!  Maurice.  It’s umm, it has something to do with transponding.  That’s not even a word!  NOOOOOOOOO!!!!!  Hey, we would still be living here if hadn’t gotten the question wrong!  I\\'m so sorry that you had to find out this way. I\\'m sorry, but iit-t\\'s true, I love him too.  Well, this is the last box of your clothes. I’m just gonna label it, \"What were you thinking?\"  Whoa-whoa-whoa, Phoebe you gotta take her! Y’know, I-I-I said some really bad stuff about her, but y’know Rachel has some good qualities that make her a good roommate. She gets tons of catalogs and umm, she’ll fold down the pages of the things she thinks that I’d like.  When I take a shower, she leaves me little notes on the mirror.  When I fall asleep on the couch after reading, she covers me over with a blanket.  She really left.  Thank you.  Can I ask you a question?  And?  We can\\'t afford that.  Well, there you go.  Yeah, we\\'ll be okay.  I know there\\'ll be other houses, but it\\'s just so... I love that one so much.  What?  Oh my God!  Oh my God! My God! We\\'ve got the house !?  And a baby...  We sure are.  Rachel, this is yours.  All right, everybody open them!  I know.  Enjoy!  Ok.  But ehm...what is it not?  And what else is it not?  Hey, maybe I\\'ll drive you up there! I\\'d like to buy some tickets myself!  Yeah with Chandler not getting paid, we could really use 300 million dollars.  How do you know she\\'s gonna start talking?  God! Look at all these tickets! It\\'s so exciting! You know I haven\\'t won anything since the sixth grade.  Oh! You assume because I was heavy that\\'s the only way I could win something?  I\\'m parked in a garage on Morton!  Chandler is supposed to find out if he\\'s getting an assistent job at his ad agency. But out of the 15 interns, they are only hiring three.  Oh! I hate that guy! I mean come on kid! Pull up your pants!  Hey that reminds me, I thought we could use some extra luck so I brought a wishbone home from work.  Alright, who wants to do it?  Ok, hey Rach?  Well, it doesn\\'t really matter ... you\\'re both wishing for the same thing, right?  Right! .. but we \"know\" what you\\'re wishing for!  I understand, but you\\'re wishing for what we think you\\'re wishing for, aren\\'t you?  You know what, Ross? I\\'m gonna throw in 50 bucks for you.  Because I know that you think the lottery is \"boohaki\" but we\\'re all here and gonna watch the numbers and have fun. And you\\'re my brother, and I want you to be a part of this.  Hey, don\\'t say that! You got just as good a chance as anybody else of getting that job!  I\\'m sorry, idea time is over.  Yeah.  There are no tickets on the nightstand!  Un, no you didn\\'t! You must be mistaken!  Chandler, sense the tone!!  Ok, fine!! I bought 20 extra tickets for me and Chandler.  Hey, you just got in 5 minutes ago!  When you were reading the dirty magazines without taking off the plastic!  Please ... if I win the lottery, you guys are not gonna leave me. Someone gave me a basket of mini-muffins last week and I couldn\\'t get rid of you for 3 days!  There\\'s the man I married!!  Fine! Don\\'t be my friends! I\\'ll buy new friends! Yeah, and then I\\'ll pay for their plastic surgery so they\\'d look just like you!  Phoebe, we lost half of them.  Oh, play them!  Oh God, I am so sorry honey...  We are on a roll, people!!  Check your numbers! Make me rich!  Make me rich!!  Oh sweetie, I\\'m so proud of you!  Let me see!  You know what? You can have mine.  You’re not gonna believe this. Okay, so I go over...  So guys, listen, I go over there, and umm...  He didn’t ask me to marry him.  He wanted to tell me he’s gonna compete is some ultimate fighting competition thingy.  I don’t know exactly. It’s-it’s sorta like wrestling.  Yeah, but without the costumes.  So you can like, bite, and pull people’s hair and stuff?  What’s fish hooking?  I gotta tell ya, I think it’s okay to be that guy.  Okay, can we please go eat?  Hey, umm, so listen umm, my friends were telling me a little about this ah, ultimate fighting thing and it, well it sounds really dangerous. I-I don’t want you to get hurt, ‘cause I kinda like you.  Promise me you’ll be careful.  Hey, are we still on for tonight?  Okay, good, ‘cause umm, well maybe we could have a little workout of our own...  How ‘bout just a boom?  God Ross, what is that?  I love you, Pete!!!  I mean I-I thought you were nuts at first, but you-you did it. And now you can just look back at this thing with no regrets.  Well, you’re not gonna get going are you?  Well, no. But...  That guy stood on your neck until you passed out!  You didn’t know that already?  Yeah. That-that was the problem.  Oh, about five minutes. Right now they’re interviewing his opponent. Apparently he trains by going to Iran and pulling the arms off thieves.  Please tell me you’re stopping now.  You are insane! You-you gotta give this up!  Sit down. All right? Please, just listen to me. You are terrible at this! Okay? You are the worst ultimate fighter ever! Ever!!  Well then, y\\'know what? I care about you to much to watch you hurt yourself like this. So if you have to do this, then you’re gonna have to do it without me.  Yes?  Really?!  I’m not sick!! I don’t get sick! Getting sick is for weaklings and for pansies!  I don’t need a tissue! I’m fine-d!  I’m fine-d. I’m fine-d! Y’know, it’s a really hard word to say.  You bought a boat?  Okay, so what do you, what do you want to do? Let’s do something crazy!  Okay, I’ll rest. But y’know if I’m going to bed, then you’re coming with me.  I’m with you Chandler! I mean I can’t have sex with a sick person either, that’s disgusting! But I’m not sick! Let me prove it to you. We are two healthy people in the pribe of libe.  How could I be asleep knowing that you were in the next room.  Come on! I really need your help!  Fine, I’ll rub it on myself.  Yeah?  Are you kidding me?! Is this; is this turning you on?  I can’t believe it! What is it? Is it the rubbing or the smell?  Not now, I’m sick!  What happened to your rule about never sleeping with sick people?  Okay, if you really wanna have sex…  Worked like a charm.  God, Ross is on a date with your sister! How weird is that?!  What about the part where he has rabies?  Hey, have you guys eaten, because uh, Richard and I just finished and we\\'ve got leftovers... Chicken and potatoes... What am I wearing?...Actually, nothing but rubber gloves.  Alright, I\\'ve got a leg, three breasts and a wing.  Alright, for the bizillionth time, yes I see other women in shower at the gym, and no I don\\'t look.  I meant, why don\\'t you take Richard to the game? What?  C\\'mon. Keeps his fingers to himself and he\\'s always minty fresh.  Wow, all you need now is The Killing Fields and some guacamole and you\\'ve got yourself a part-ay.  Hey. Where is he, where\\'s Richard? Did you ditch him?  So\\'d you guys have fun?  Really?  So your first whole weekend without Ben, what\\'re you guys gonna do?  Ross.  You know what, I think it\\'s cute, you trying to be more like Richard.  So Joey, why didn\\'t you grow a moustache?  You\\'re meeting Richard?  Well, he told me he was going out with the guys, I just didn\\'t know that you were the guys.  With that moustache doesn\\'t Chandler remind you of Aunt Sylvia?  So you watched the movies huh?  Alright, you wanna feel better?  Ok, here, watch this.  So you can\\'t lose, it\\'s there in the title. Wonderfullness is baked right in.  There\\'s a game?  Listen, um honey, I appreciate this but you don\\'t have to keep hanging out with them for me, I mean, they have each other.  Alright that\\'s great, then just go. Go Knicks.  Oh, then go Vassar.  Ok, then just go.  Oh, why does this bother me so much? I mean I don\\'t wanna be one of those people who tells their boyfriend they wanna spend 24 hours a day with them.  It\\'s just that he doesn\\'t have that much free time, ya know, and I don\\'t know, what do I do?  I\\'ve got a question. Richard made plans again with the guys.  Ya know what, I think I\\'m gonna go to my room and read Cosmo, maybe there\\'s something helpful in there. Know what, at least maybe I can learn how to do an at home bikini wax with leftover Cristmas candles.  Did you like it?  Alright, I\\'ll give you the ear thing but don\\'t you think the ending was pretty wonderful?  Um-hmm.  Nighty-nite.  Come here. I\\'ll make you feel like one of the guys. You know for a really cool guy, you suck at foosball.  Yeah, well they suck too.  Awww, come on—wait—stop it. Okay, to Monica.  Y’know what we should do? We should all get dressed up and go to have champagne at The Plaza.  Okay everybody, let’s go! Let’s go!  Yeah, but I don’t think we have time.  Phoebe!  Fair enough, now go get ready!  See, I’ve been waiting my whole life to be engaged, and unlike some people I’m only planning on doing this once. So, uh y’know, maybe this is selfish and I’m sorry about it, but I was kinda hoping tonight could just be about that.  No it’s not! No! No! Now it’s about you and Ross getting back together!  See yeah umm, you kinda stole my thunder!  That’s true.  Thunder being stolen!!  Well, we’re still talking about it, aren’t we?  Yes that would be lovely.  Y’know what? I-I think that umm, I don’t feel like going to The Plaza.  I can’t believe her, y’know it’s just—it’s so typical.  Paris?  Keep talking.  I love you!  What?!  Yes.  Well, let’s just say it’s not the first time you’ve stolen my thunder.  My Sweet Sixteen! Remember, you went to third base with my cousin Charlie.  It’s all everybody at the party could talk about!  And yet, here we are doing it again.  Oh please! Why else would you have made out with Ross?!  I just thought it would be nice if I could have just this one night!  Oh, is that why you did it the secret hallway where nobody ever goes?!  I don’t know! I don’t—maybe you’re feeling a little resentful. Maybe ah, maybe you thought you’d get married first! Maybe you can’t stand the fact that your formally fat friend is getting married before you!  I just wanted to say that I hope you do have sex tonight and I hope that you guys get back together, but I must warn you, the night that you announce your engagement I’m going to announce that I’m pregnant!  I know why!  Okay! Why?!  What do you mean?  Hey.  I know. How could we have let this happen?  Ugh! Well, y’know, we were away…  I blame London.  So look umm, while we’re st-still in London, I mean, we can keep doing it right?  Only here.  I’ll meet you there in two minutes.  Oh, I-I don’t know.  Wait. Rachel, no, he’s married. Married! If you don’t realize that, I can’t help you.  Where were you? We were supposed to meet in the wine cellar?  Why?!  Joey, what are you doing? You promised Phoebe you wouldn’t eat meat until she has the babies!  That’s true.  Oh my God, Rachel! Hi!  Yes, I want to change. And why-why don’t you go down and get us a table?  Great…  No time for that!  Which we are, and-and we already paid for it. It’s My Giant!  You really think this is okay?  Oh, it’s so beautiful. Ohh! Y’know, I-I don’t know if I feel right about this.  Okay!  You didn’t find her?  Yeah, I think you should keep looking!  Or 45.  Well, it’s getting late.  Ugh, y’know, umm we gotta get up early and catch that plane for New York.  I know, I’ve been looking at those doors, they look pretty sound proof, don’t you think?  Y’know, maybe it’s best that we never got to do it again.  I’m gonna go to the bathroom, maybe I’ll see you there in a bit?  I know!  Phoebe, I did not have sex.  Well, we certainly are alone.  Right. Umm, listen since we’re-we-re on that subject, umm, I just wanted to tell you that uh, well, I-I was going through a really hard time in London, what with my brother getting married and that guy thinking I was Ross’s mother…  Well, an-anyway, I just—that night meant a lot to me, I guess I’m just trying to say thanks.  And you’re cute too.  Okay.  That counts!  No I totally disagree. No I think it\\'s fine for a guy to do something like that. Such you an actor. Not that you need to,  Only if I don\\'t have to get up and sing.  It\\'s just, I\\'m not good at singing.  No no, it\\'s not working on me. Wow! I must be growing up!  So I don\\'t have to sing and I can just sit there and pass judgments on others?  I\\'m there!  You kissed him?  Wait wait wait. I was at home the whole time. How did I missed that?  Oh yeah...So how did you end up kissing?  I thought you hated him?  So are you thinking of starting up something with this guy?  Sounds like you need to think about what you want, talk to Gavin, and you definitely should talk to Ross  No I told you I can\\'t.  What have you heard me sing?  What?  Yeah I do rock that one.  Just a little but...it\\'s just so scary! I don\\'t even know what I would sing...  \"Delta Dawn\"  Wait wait! I can\\'t sing in front of all these people.  Hi! I\\'m Monica and I\\'m gonna be singing \"Delta Dawn\"  \"To take you to his mansion in the sky-y?\"  \"Take me to the mansion in the sky-y\". I am sorry, the song is over. Did you see me out there?  I can�t believe I did this. I can�t believe I\\'m singing for the people, and they liked me! Hey, did you hear that  Good? Didn�t you hear them...I was great! Thank you so much for making me do this. That�s is the best gift ever.  Ok, for my next song I think I�ll sing something a little more upbeat. All right? Oh, how about the Pointer  Honey, you�re just in time, I�m about to sing another song!  And they love me!  All right, watch!  \"Tonight\\'s the night we\\'re gonna make it happen, tonight we\\'ll put all other things aside. Give in this  Oh, who cares, they still love me! \"I am so excited...\"  Rachel?!  Ohh, this is soo amazing! I can’t believe my brother’s getting married! And in London! It’s so romantic!  Hey!  I never knew that either.  We’re hanging out.  I’m sorry honey.  Rach, you’re gonna come though aren’t you?  You know what would be real weird? Is if you weren’t there. Just say you’ll think about it, okay?  I can\\'t believe he did this.  You know what this is, this is us getting ready for the prom.  Shut up, the camera adds ten pounds.  Oh, dad, turn it off.  If you\\'re not going then I don\\'t want to go either.  You don’t have a car. And your license expired.  I can\\'t believe we\\'ve never done this before! It\\'s sooo good! So good for Monica!  That was a half an hour?  Y\\'know, I don\\'t like to brag about it, but I give the best massages!  It\\'s so good, isn\\'t it?  Say good-bye to sore muscles!  Ohh my God, I\\'m so sorry.  What?! What honey?  Oh, did you catch him?!  All right, let\\'s go say good-bye.  Well, at least you scared someone.  Phoebe, you do seem a little tense. Here, let me help you.  What are you talking about?  No he\\'s not!  What?!  You\\'ve been lying to me? I can\\'t believe you\\'d do that.  No.  Oh, please, stop! Look, we\\'re supposed to be honest with each other. I-I just wish you could tell me—just say, \"I don\\'t like your massages.\"  I\\'m not crying about that! I\\'m crying about something that happened at work.  Oh my God! You don\\'t know me at all!  I\\'m crying here!!  Huh. So you\\'re saying like umm, if there was an award for the best bad massage, well who would get that?  So maybe they could umm, call the award the Monica?  Okay. I suck!  Y\\'know, Joey, I think it\\'s time to give up the bag.  I won’t give you anything, but you’ll owe me 2.95.  Okay, let’s start with the free messages outside the UN.  Wow! You might just get the first Nobel prize in rubbing. So what country is this guy from?  Where’s that?  I don’t have an atlas.  Oh, but wait I do have a globe.  Hold on.  It’s a globe and, a pencil sharpener.  Oh, no thanks.  Well, if you don’t have anything to copy, why are you going down there?  Wow! It’s small.  So you had fun, huh?  No.  Oh no, she’s still at work, but she told me to tell you to call her.  Yeah, well kinda cute, like really kinda cute, or kinda cute like your friend Spackel Back Larry?  Oh my God! No wonder I get such great service at Cafe Maurice.  I’m also thinking about opening up my own restaurant.  Well, I was having a conversation.  What do you want me to do? Just sit here silently while you three have a conversation?  Hey, the man’s dog just died.  What are you talking about? We�re all together right now.  Oh, dear god!  This is not, what I�m wearing. I�m ovulating and Chandler�s gonna be home any minute, so I thought we would try before dinner.  Believe me, Chandler and I have not seen each other in over a week. We�ll probably be the first ones there.  You don�t need a shower.  How can you smoke in this day of age? Do you not seen that ad with a little kid walks to grandpa, it�s chilling.  So what? Don�t you have any will power?  You said that was sexy!  That�s right, because I forbid you to smoke again.  Mhmm.  Yes.  Well, I�ll tell you what we�re gonna do: We are already late for Phoebe�s birthday dinner, so you point out put out that cigarette, we�re gonna put this fight on hold and go have sex.  Oh yeah!  Huh, and no cuddling.  Oh good, I hate it when you do that  Spend more time with the tie. That�ll make a baby.  Oh sure, now you�re Mister Sensitivity. But when you wanted to have sex right after my uncle�s funeral  No, you�re right. Mnya, we shouldn�t do it like this. Huch. For what it�s worth, I�m, I�m sorry. I shouldn�t have come down on you so hard about the smoking. So you had a few cigarettes, not the end of the world.  Yah.  D�you want to?  �kay.  You know what? Let�s not talk.  Uch. I am still so mad at you for smoking.  Oh, blablablabaybaybay.  I was just saying that because I was ovulating and you said you wouldn�t have sex with me while we�re fighting.  That�s right, I got mine.  Well, we had a little fight.  Why would you do that?  Mom�s here? I wanted to have lunch with her today, she told me she was out of town.  Uch, you see, I�m ovulating.  Yes smokie, that is what it was. I just can�t get enough.  Bye.  So, I�m, I�m probably still ovulating. Do you want to give it another try?  We don�t have much time. Once the egg descended the oviduct �  Phoebe! You\\'re sick, you shouldn\\'t play. You should just go home, get in bed, and stay there.  Just be yourself. But, not too much.  That cold makes you sound so great.  Y\\'know what, I like Kathy.  Oh umm, how about your mom dying, or having to live on the streets when you were 14?  Hey!  Rachel\\'s not here.  How\\'s it going with her?  Hi, Josh.  Very!  It\\'s this dumb thing that Ross made up `cause he was trying to fool our parents. It\\'s a way of giving the finger, without actually having to give it. I remember I cried the night you made it up, `cause it was the first time that I realized that I was actually cooler than my older brother.  Oh come on! You\\'re making it sound worse than it actually was.  Phoebe, you\\'ll catch pneumonia.  What?  Why?  Thank you so much Phoebe.  What are you doing with those?!  Sorry, Phoebe.  Ohhhh!! Gross!!  No, sorry.  Hey Rach, could you get me some cough drops?  Ross, cough drops, please?  And what are you laughing at, Miss `My-keg-sucking-boyfriend-is-stealing-from-me!\\'  That\\'s mine!! Now, would you both please start acting like adults? And get me my cough drops!  God, look what I found in the drain.  God, what is wrong with me.  I need to get some Richard.  I know, I know. I\\'m just so tired of-of missing him. I\\'m tired of wondering why hasn\\'t he called. Why hasn\\'t he called!  What are you the memory woman?  Hi.  Oh, they-they sent me home.  Because I don\\'t work at the Szechwan Dragon.  I know I do.  Richard\\'s living room, drinking wine.  I\\'m sorry, but that\\'s my happy place.  All right, I\\'ll try not to.  Do you think breaking up with him was a huge mistake?  I\\'ll bet he\\'s totally over me, I\\'ll bet he\\'s fine.  Okay, this isn\\'t working. I\\'m still awake and now I have to pee.  Hi, Dad, what are you doing here?  I don\\'t, I just, I just like the smell of them. So, uh, what are you really doing here Dad?  What makes you think that I might not be okay?  Oh.  I\\'m fine, just a little tired, I\\'m okay. How\\'s Richard doing?  No, I really, really do.  Really!  You\\'re not just saying that are you?  Was he crying?  Well, do you think he was waiting \\'til after you left, so he could cry?  I think so.  Yeah.  Yeah, I’d really like to.  Yes! Every year Ross makes the toast, and it’s always really moving, and always makes them cry. Well this year I’m going to make them cry.  No! Really! Any time Ross makes a toast everyone cries, and hugs him, and pats him on the back and they all come up to me and say, \"God, your brother.\" Know what they’ll say this year? \"God, you\"  Really you can do that?  It’s a dead dog. That’s Chi-Chi; she died when I was in high school.  The good stuff, huh?  You got a present for my parents. That’s so sweet.  What?!  That’s my old dog. He passed away years ago.  It’s out on the island. It’s in Massapequa.  And I’ve got the car keys.  Yeah.  He called the Long Island Expressway a concrete miracle.  It’s just that, it’s so much.  I feel terrible.  Just going over my toast. Those two will never know what hit ‘em. I can’t wait. They’re going to be crying so hard. They’re going to be fighting for breath.  Okay it’s time for the toast! Umm now-now, I know that Ross usually gives the toast, but this year I’m going to do it.  Okay that’s it. I give up. At mom and dad’s 40th anniversary, you’re the one giving the speech.  Oh, come on.  Well that\\'s because you always sleep to noon, silly! This is what 9 looks like.  I\\'m really getting tired of sneaking around.  All weekend? That\\'s a whole lotta naked.  Ohh, I\\'ve always wanted to go to this culinary fair that they have in Jersey!  Wait! What about Joey?  Oh now that-that-that\\'s funny, it seems like Chandler\\'s conference could\\'ve been in Connecticut or Vermont.  Hey.  No, she\\'s out shopping.  Wow, so you guys are, you\\'re never gonna be in the same room together? How is that even gonna work?  Hey, Joey\\'s ass! What are you doing?  Ooh, candy bars, crossword puzzles…  Sweetie, we heard you crying. Please don\\'t cry.  Ooh, chocolates on the pillows! I love that!  We\\'re switching rooms.  We\\'re switching rooms again.  This is a garden view room, and we paid for an ocean view room.  Chandler!  Look, these clowns are trying to take us for a ride and I\\'m not gonna let \\'em! And we\\'re not a couple of suckers!  Okay, this one I like!  Can we turn the TV off? Okay? Do we really want to spend the entire weekend like this?  Hey, don\\'t blame me for wigging tonight!  I don\\'t know, how about the idiot who thought he could drive from Albany to Canada on a half a tank of gas!  We\\'re supposed to uh, be spending a romantic weekend together, it-it, what is the matter with you?  What did you say?  Yeah. Umm, Chandler can I talk to you outside for a second?  Okay, I\\'d like to know how much the room was because I\\'d like to pay my half.  300 dollars?!  Urghh!!  Chandler stole a twenty from my purse!  Maybe I could do it.  Hey.  You\\'re not gonna be phased out!  Hi.  Yeah, it did.  What?  Why, exactly?  I\\'m afraid so.  Hey!  Yeah, I saw him waiting for an elevator.  Hey, Rach, can I borrow your eyelash curler, I think I lost mine.  Yes, but you cannot tell anyone! No one knows!  Please? Please?! We just don\\'t want to deal with telling everyone, okay? Just promise you won\\'t tell.  I know, it\\'s great!  Oh that\\'s cute! We really all enjoyed it. But y\\'know, it doesn\\'t count.  Count in our heads as-as good Madlibs.  Wait-wait, guys! If-if we follow the rules, it\\'s still fun and it means something!  Boy, you are really not a morning person.  What kind of changes?  Oh, good luck.  That is sooo not true!  I just—I can’t believe that you think that you and Chandler know me and Rachel better than we know you.  Yeah.  Deal!  Ha-ha!  Aww, man!  That does not mean you know us better, I-I want a rematch.  Yeah! And the winner gets a hundred bucks.  Are you scared?  Ross will do it.  You guys! Do you realize that any minute now, Phoebe can be pregnant?  Same category?  Michael Flatley, Lord of the Dance!  No!!  I knew that! Rachel! Use you’re head!  Viva Las Gaygas!  You guys are dead, I am so good at lighting rounds.  Huh, wanna bet?  How about we play for more money, say 150?  You’re doing it again.  I’m just trying to spice it up!  I got it! How about, if we win, they have to get rid of the rooster?  Deal!  No! Steady as a rock! Now, are you with me.  Come on!  Come on!  Sandwiches!  Maurice.  And processing.  It’s umm, it has something to do with transponding.  That’s not even a word! I can get this! I can get this!  NOOOOOOOOO!!!!!  Man, I feel like I’m coming down with something.  How do you feel?  Really?! How much?!  Look Rach, we have to move. I mean if they had lost, we would’ve made them get rid of the birds. Right?  All right, look, I hate this as much as you, but if it makes you feel better, it’s all your fault.  Chinadolor Bong, come on, we steal that TV Guide every week!  Well?  It’s only been a couple of hours, so just give it some time.  Hey, Rach, can you give me a hand with this box?  I’ll take care of it.  I lost our mattresses.  Hey!  Hey, don’t mix those up, you could really ruin that lollipop.  Hey, we would still be living here if hadn’t gotten the question wrong!  I can’t find garbage bags!  What is it?!  I can’t believe we’re living here!  Chandler come on. We have to hem the new dust ruffle.  Hey guys.  It was okay. She’s still kind of depressed because she broke up with her boyfriend.  Yeah.  No, the one who looked at you once because you got in her way.  I don’t think mine likes me either.  We should go.  What happened to your teeth.  Well, I think I shouldn’t look directly at them.  Ross they’re really, really, really white.  How much longer?  Ross you know that tonight is your date with Hillary?  She will be after tonight.  Oh my god.  Hey Ross, maybe if your skin was lighter. Your teeth wouldn’t look so bright.  I’m just saying, if we put just a little bit of makeup on you.  Ross this is the only thing left that has a shot at working.  Please. Half the guys out there have makeup on.  All right, half the people. I mean, just try it and see.  Now are drawers will smell nice and we didn’t waste these pantyhose.  Wait, we’re supposed to organize the wrapping paper drawer.  You know what? This has been kind of a girlie day. You’re right, I’m sorry.  Yeah. Go over to Joey’s. Go over to Joey’s and drink some beer and hammer up some drywall.  Oh my God, Joey, that is such a great tip.  Okay. Oh but Joey, come over later because I’m going to teach you to make a bird feeder out of just a pine cone and some peanut butter.  Oh, yeah.  Yes! Why, did you—you forget to make yours?  Sure! Okay, you go first.  Okay.  Oh, what a great gift! Is The Way You Look Tonight on it?!  Oh, I love it! Thank you so much!  Okay, you ready to open yours?  Okay.  Yeah-yeah, you remember how I call you bunny?  Well, I did one time, and-and I want to start doing it more. See that’s what this is about.  No! No, she doesn’t. Uh Phoebe, what she makes—that’s uh—they’re sock rabbits. They are completely different—Okay! Okay! Okay! I didn’t make it! I’m sorry! I totally forgot about tonight and the fact that we’re supposed to make the presents!  Do you remember that jacket that you love so much, that you thought was too expensive?  I wanna wake up early and go get it for you!  Oop, your cake is ready!  Who the hell are you?!  The only problem!  Hey! Continuing the countdown of your favorite meals. Tonight, No. 3, macaroni and cheese with cut up hot dogs.  I will! But not tonight. For dinner music, I thought we could listen to that tape you made me.  The Way You Look Tonight is on here! Dance with me?  Okay.  I\\'m at work, ordinary day, you know, chop chop chop, sauti, sauti, sauti. All of a sudden, Leon, the manager, calls me into his office. It turns out they fired the head lunch chef, and guess who got the job.  Fortunately, it is me. And, they made me head of purchasing, thank you very much. Anyway, I just ran into Ross and Chandler downstairs, and they think we should go out and celebrate. You know, someplace nice.  Who is also in charge of purchasing.  Who has her own little desk when Roland\\'s not there.  Oh, wait, and I got a beeper!  Oh, sorry.  Yes, I will start with the carpaccio, and then I\\'ll have the grilled prawns.  Oh, thank you!  All right, what\\'s goin\\' on?  Ok.  If it makes anybody feel better, then we can just forget the thing, and we\\'ll just do the gift.  All of us.  I don\\'t know, Chandler. Let\\'s take a look.  Why, it\\'s dinner for six. 5 steaks, and an eggplant for Phoebe.  Yeah, we switched meat suppliers at work, and the new guys gave me the steaks as sort of a thank-you.  It\\'s on us, all right, so don\\'t worry. It\\'s our treat.  Like?  Charity?  Guys, we bought the tickets.  Well, I guess now we can\\'t go.  You know what? You\\'re right.  All right. We\\'re gonna go. It\\'s not for another six hours. We\\'re gonna go then.  You know what? I\\'m not gonna be able to enjoy this.  You know, the guys are probably having a great time.  That was amazing!  Do I know you?  Oh my god, little Stevie Fisher? How\\'ve you been?  You can\\'t be a lawyer. You\\'re eight.  Uh, wait, backstage?  Yeah, ours pretty much sucked, oh, but, I did run into little Stevie Fisher. Remember him?  Uh, good.  No, I just, I fell down.  You know, a party, or--  That would be the work of a Blowfish.  It\\'s work.  Leon, Leon. Shhh! Guys. Wait, I don\\'t understand. Those steaks were just a gift from the meat vendor. That was not a kick back. I\\'ll just replace them and we can forget the whole thing. What corporate policy? No. Yeah. All right. I just got fired.  Oh, I so can\\'t believe this! My uterus is an inhospitable environment? I was trying so hard to be a good hostess!  Hi.  Ok.  Don\\'t worry, after a while he\\'ll tune it out.  Hi honey!  Oh, of course, it\\'s so nice to see you again, Zack!  I got it.  Yeah, I guess.  Chandler, this is crazy! What did you even say to him! \"Come up, meet my wife! Give us your sperm\"!  Chandler!  I\\'m not going to be a part of this! You can\\'t just bring some random guy at home and expect him to be our sperm donor!  Uh!  Tell me about yourself, Zack!  Hey guys! Dinner\\'s ready!  Ok, there\\'s enthusiastic and there\\'s just plain gay!!  I think he is fine! It\\'s just that we don\\'t know anything real about him... we should get more information.  Oh, friends first, drunk in London, you know the story. I\\'ve got a better question for you: Do you or any of your blood relatives have diabetes?  Eh... Heart Disease, Alzheimers, gout?  Does seem pretty perfect.  No, that\\'s not it. It\\'s just that when we were asking him all those questions before, I just... I just realized I don\\'t care if he\\'s the most perfect guy in the world... he\\'s not you.  No, he\\'s not. And if I can\\'t get pregnant with you, then I don\\'t want to get pregnant by... him or anyone else.  Yeah, I\\'m sure.  Adoption.  I think I feel ok about it. Actually I think I feel really good about it.  So this is it, we\\'re really gonna adopt?  All right, so I haven’t cleared the budget with my parents yet, but tell me how this is for music.  All right umm, a string quartet for the procession.  A jazz trio for cocktails. The Bay City Rollers for dancing. Wait, that was from my sixth grade wedding.  Of course you can look at it! Yeah, I want your opinion too!  Here you go! What do you think about centerpieces?  Oh my God! It’s like one mind.  Oh dad, really you don’t need to…  Well, at least you’re not hearing it for the first time at your fifth grade Halloween party.  What happened? You still have the Monica wedding fund don’t you?  I don’t believe you spent my wedding fund on the beach house!  You bought the beach house when I was 23!  What about when I started dating Chandler?  I can’t believe it! That there is no money for my wedding?!  I can’t believe this. Do you think that your parents could help pay for it?  My parents spent the money for our wedding!  No! No it’s not! It’s not gonna be okay! It sucks! No swing band! No lilies!  How? I don’t have any money.  How much?  Whoa!!! Are you kidding me?!  It’s enough for wedding scenario eight.  This is the most special day of our lives.  You-you’re gonna have to put your foot down?  Hey.  Listen umm, I’ve been thinking, it’s not fair for me to ask you to spend all of your money on our wedding. I mean, you work, you work really hard for that.  Eh, you work for that.  You do?!  You thought about that?  How many kids were we gonna have?  What else did you think about?  No, I want everything you just said. I want a marriage.  Uh-hmm.  Oh good.'},\n {'character': 'Phoebe',\n  'concatenated_lines': 'Oh Willie’s still alive!  Oh my God! That’s the creep that you’re with at the Statue of Liberty.  Hey, why don’t you guys go, get portraits done by a professional photographer.  Yeah that’s great! Next to that, Chandler won’t look so stupid.  He is! But he’s getting divorced—Ross! Maybe you know him.  You don’t have to be back for a half-hour!  So you wouldn’t mind if he was dating someone else?  I’m having a really good time!  Ohh. No that’s okay, he’s a friend.  Yeah, I… Well y’know I-I mean I missed the-the semi-finals, so I’d just be lost.  Okay, don’t freak out. I’ll go.  Hi Ginger.  I don’t have it!  All right, well I just wanted to say thank you though for diverting Kyle’s ex.  Okay.  Watching ballroom dancing?  Well look-look, okay Ross, Kyle just told me some really bad stuff about her.  Like she’s really mean, and she’s over critical, and-and—No! She will paint a room a really bright color without even checking with you!  And! She uses sex as a weapon!  You’re still gonna go out with her?!  Well, didn’t you just hear what I said?!  You see? Nothing is good enough for her!  Hi.  So, how are things going with crazy? Has she cooked your rabbit yet?  Yeah well, maybe she should’ve spent a little less time decorating and a little more time in the bedroom.  You think he’s emotionally unavailable?  Well, maybe he wouldn’t be she didn’t bring the office home every night!  Yeah well, she certainly knew what she was doing New Year’s Eve 1997.  Oh, I’m sorry. Is that annoying? And speaking about being selfish in bed, how’s Whitney?  Both of you together?  What about her whining and her constant need for attention?!  Oh right, because you’re so capable of change.  Yeah, and y’know what? I don’t give a tiny rat’s ass.  Oh. Y’know, he hums while he does other stuff to.  And y’know, even if they break up again, you’d better not let him in your sad men’s club!  Ooh, let’s see it!  Wow!  What?  Yeah, what is that? Like, some kind of guy thing? Like, some kind of sexist guy thing? Like it\\'s poker, so only guys can play?  Oh, OK, so then what is it? Some kind of... you know, like, like... some kind of, y\\'know, like... alright, what is it?  Congratulations!  OK, I just need two... the, um, ten of spades and the six of clubs.  But... I\\'m ready, so, just deal.  About how good your cards were.  A-ha! And... what is bluffing? Is it not another word for... lying?  OK, Monica? I had another answer all ready.  Ha. Ha, ha.  Oh, hello, kettle? This is Monica. You\\'re black.  Oh, it\\'s like the mother ship is calling you home.  Ross, could we please, please, please listen to anything else?  Oh, I cursed it. So now bad things will happen to he who spends it.  You guys, you know what I just realized? \\'Joker\\' is \\'poker\\' with a \\'J.\\' Coincidence?  Monica, in or out?  OK Joey, your bet.  Ross?  Chandler?  Me too. Rachel.  Plus that shirt doesn\\'t really match those pants.  Y\\'know, there\\'s gonna be lots of other stuff.  I\\'m in.  That\\'s a bird?  That\\'s a bird!  Oh, I got tired of naming states. So I decided to list the types of celery, and I have one: regular celery.  Hey you guys I\\'m gonna go out and take a walk.  Oh, it\\'s not!  I\\'m sorry, who\\'s this?  No, there\\'s no dog here?  There\\'s no dog in here.  That\\'s odd, \\'cause this dog\\'s been living here for the past 3 days  Are you crazy?  Why?  You don\\'t like ice cream?  Oh, I\\'d say about a month.  Yeah, okay.  You know if you want, we can sneak the dog back in and Chandler wouldn\\'t even know.  I\\'ve had that dog there for three days and Chandler had no idea. He\\'s not so smart.  Yeah, but you kinda knew that something was going on, didn\\'t you?  Where\\'s Chandler?  Wash your hands!!!  Okay, but you cannot tell him... but look whose back!  Oh no, the dog\\'s not going to be there!  We have good news, look whose back!  It\\'s a Thanksgiving miracle!  What?!  Oh, look, twins. Hi, guys. Oh, cute, cute.  Hey!  Well let’s just say its she’s lucky she has a sweet ass, ‘cause she’s not so good at the writing.  Well let’s just hope it works. Y’know nine out of ten marriages end in divorce?  Yeah, you’re right. How’s the Mrs.?  CHANDLER AND MONICA!!!!  OH!! MY EYES!!! MY EYES!!!!  NO! THEY\\'RE DOING IT!!!  YOU KNOW?!!!  Okay, so now they know that you know and they don\\'t know that Rachel knows?  Or, we could not tell them we know and have a little fun of our own  No!  He\\'s not backing down. He went to get lotion.  Ooh.  Here it comes. Our first kiss.  And why not?!  You\\'re-you\\'re what?!  I just—I thought you guys were doing it, I didn\\'t know you were in love!  Y’know, you’re friend’s getting married, it’s gotta change things.  How could it not be? I mean pretty soon they’re gonna be having kids, and then they’re just gonna be hanging out with other couples who have kids. And then maybe they’re gonna have to leave the city to be near a Volvo dealership.  Hey.  Oh!  Okay.  I can\\'t, I have to take my grandmother to the vet.  Monica, she will kill you. She will kill you like a dog in the street.  Woof, woof.  What?  Oh, all right. What did I have?  Oh, no wonder I don\\'t feel full.  I went shopping with Monica all day, and I had a salad.  Um, we went shopping for um, for, fur.  Ben, dinner!  I licked my arm, what?  So?  You won\\'t even taste it?  Not even if you just pretend that it\\'s milk?  Oh, I tasted Ben\\'s milk, and Ross freaked out.  Come on. It doesn\\'t taste bad.  No, no, it’s just my tooth.  No thanks, I have a good one too. I just, I, I can’t see him.  Because, every time I go to the dentist, somebody dies.  Yeah, yeah, first there was my aunt Mary, and then there was umm, John, my mailman, and then my, my cowboy friend ‘Albino Bob’.  Yes, while I was in the chair! That’s why I take such good care of my teeth now, y\\'know, it’s not about oral hygiene, I floss to save lives!  Well tell that to them. Oh! You can’t, their dead.  All right, fine, fine, but if you’re my next victim, don’t come back as a poltergeist and like suck me into the TV set.  Although, don’t feel like you can’t visit.  Well, you could wait ‘til I go to the dentist, maybe I’ll kill him.  Yeah, well, we’ll see about that. Can I use your phone? I just wanna call everyone I know.  Woo-Hoo! The curse is broken! I called everybody I know, and everyone is alive.  What?  Oh my God! I killed him! I killed another one! And this curse is getting stronger too, to bring down something that big.  I’m telling you he’s dead. What we are about to have here is a dead fat guy on a stick.  He’s alive! He’s a-live!!!  I know.  I’ve found....  Hey!  Hey!  Well, personally I think it\\'s great you\\'re giving yourself a break.  Sure. It\\'s just as well... I mean, last year wasn\\'t very good. I think she\\'s losing her touch.  Am I? Really? Am I? Well, why don\\'t you cook Thanksgiving dinner and prove me wrong! Well, think about it, think about it, you\\'ll be trying to top than you did last year. You\\'d be in competition... with yourself.  Hey!  Oh, yeah, happy needless-turkey-murder day.  You\\'re not making the pies yourself?  Hey Rach.  What\\'s Emma doing today?  Well, I wanna enter her in a baby beauty pageant.  Okay, but, well, before you say no, my friend Susanne is entering her kid and compared to Emma she\\'s a real dog!  Okay, oh, and Emma needs a cowgirl outfit for the competition.  Well, I was thinking...  Yeah!  Hey.  We can\\'t leave now! There was this one baby, Haley, who was favourite to win and she got croup, so she had to stay home! This competition just blew wide open, folks!  Okay. Rachel, the hottest babies in the Tri-State Area are in this room right now! I overheard one of the judges say that not one of them holds a candle to Emma!  Yeah!  Yeah!  Good! Oh yay! Let\\'s get down to business! Emma needs some makeup!  Well, she\\'s gonna look all washed out next to the other contestants!  Why not!  Oh!  No, we\\'re late!  Don\\'t point that thing at me, Tribbiani!  Uh, we were at the Spelling Bee!  And it looks like she put makeup on her!  You guys, there are people in there who are not getting any happier!  Alright, what are we gonna say?  Oh, good, that\\'s good, but you don\\'t look like you were mugged!  Well, I\\'m not going in first. I bet that vein on Monica\\'s forehead is popping like crazy.  It\\'s locked.  What are we gonna do? I\\'m starving.  Oh yeah!  Well, I don\\'t know if that\\'s such a good idea. They clearly don\\'t want to be with us.  So bad.  Come on you guys, let\\'s just do our own Thanksgiving.  I\\'ll pull you through.  I\\'ve already stuffed a bunch of Brussel sprouts down his pants.  Just a sec., we\\'re kind in the middle of something here.  I know. Have you considered pageanting?  Ooh, ooh, fun! Okay... um, Liam Neeson.  Morly Safer.  The woman who cuts my hair!  Rift’s. Yeah, I know.  Hmmm? Yeah. So, um, is she fat?  It’s mostly just dumb sister stuff, you know, I mean, like, everyone always thought of her as the pretty one, you know... Oh, oh, she was the first one to start walking, even though I did it... later that same day. But, to my parents, by then it was like \"yeah, right, well what else is new?\"  Why? Why would you wanna... do that?  Why?  Well, I mean, I’m not my sister’s, you know, whatever, and um... I mean, it’s true, we were one egg, once, but err, you know, we’ve grown apart, so, um... I don’t know, why not? Okay.  Yeah I’m fine.  Well, what I really want is for my mom to be alive and enjoy it with me.  Ooh! Bath salts would be nice.  Yeah?  Much as you are.  Good choice.  Alright, well, maybe now it’s not okay.  Okay.  Where’re you going?  With?  Alright, could I just ask you one question?  Have you two, you know... like... you know... you know... yet?  Alright, so, can we turn this off? Can we just make it... make them go away? Because I can’t, I can’t watch.  Okay.  Yeah. It’s just, you know, it’s this whole stupid Ursula thing, it’s...  Um, yeah. Look, I mean, I’m not saying she’s like evil or anything. She just, you know, she’s always breaking my stuff. When I was eight, and I wouldn’t let her have my Judy Jetson thermos, so she threw it under the bus. And then, oh, and then there was Randy Brown, who was like... Have you ever had a boyfriend who was like your best friend?  Well, but that’s what he was for me. And she you know, kind of stole him away, and then... broke his heart... and then he wouldn’t even talk to me any more. Because he said he didn’t wanna be around... anything that looked like either one of us.  I mean, I know Joey is not my boyfriend, or my thermos, or anything, but...  Yeah. Okay.  But he’s falling in love with her.  Okay... Okay.  Oh, okay, oh.  Oh my God, they took my idea!  Oh my God, are you guys okay?  Umm, oh, about three months.  Whoa-whoa-whoa, you guys, do you know anything about chicks?  Okay, well they are a huge responsibility, especially at this age. They require constant care. They-they need just the right food, and lot’s and lot’s of love.  I’m just saying, this woman, I mean she’s fictitious. No?  ‘Cause you’re still into Monica. So you told her there was somebody else so she would agree to work with you, so ‘cause you figure oh if you spent a lot of time together, maybe something might happen, and...  Yeah, no, I’m fairly intuitive and psychic. It’s a substantial gift.  Absolutely, oh I promise. Tell her what?  No I’m serious. I mean I’m intuitive, but my memory sucks.  Hey!  What?  Ohh, Monica, I am so excited for you.  Ooh, I have to tell you something.  But I can’t tell you.  Well, sure in a perfect world. But, no, I promised I wouldn’t tell, and I swore to like all my gods.  No.  No.  No, but let’s come back to that later!  Noo!  Oh, wait, wait. Clogs, or claws?  No.  No.  I can’t!!  I, but you’re so close! No!  Oh, just go. You’re never gonna get it!  Wow, it’s like a dirty math problem.  Oh, that is so unfortunate.  Cute naked guy is really starting to put on weight.  You didn’t leave lipstick marks on the phone.  I think on some levels she already knows.  Okay, well maybe not on those levels.  Why, nobody good?  Oh, really?  So what are they doing?  I’m just taking it to be re-wired.  No, no, Mr. Heckles no one is making any noise up here.  You don’t play the oboe!  Huh?  Okay, enough with the third degree! I-I’ve, I don’t live here anymore.  I’m sorry, I-I-I-I don’t live here anymore. I-I didn’t know how to tell you, but y\\'know everybody else knows!  That was supposed to be a good thing, I forget why. Just listen, Monica, I, do you know, okay, do you know, I couldn’t sleep for like a month because I got like a dot of ink on one of the sofa cushions.  Yeah, I would’ve except I had a big spaghetti stain on the other side.  Okay, this is what I’m talking about, this. I-I need to live in a land where people can spill.  Aw, honey it’s not your fault, y\\'know this is who you are, and I love you, and I want us to be friends, and if I keep living here I don’t see that happening.  No you’re not, you’re wondering which cushion it is.  Oh, it’s already closed, Chris gave me the keys to lock up-what is wrong?  Oh no! Why?  Oh my God! I don’t believe it! Oh, you poor bunny.  Aw! Hey, do you think that Susan person is her lover?  I’m sorry.  Huh?  Okay, it’s okay.  What?  What?  Well, that’s not something a girl wants to hear.  What?  You have chalk on your face.  Oh, Ross you’re right, I don’t know why I always thought this was real grass.  Ehh?  I-I mean I, well I think I can figure it out. I guess y\\'know I was born, and everyone started lying their asses off!  How close?  I don’t even know how that would work!  Yeah. Let’s see, my had Mom killed herself, and my Dad had run off, and I was living in a Gremlin with a guy named Cindy who talked to his hand.  Yeah, well, everybody does! I’m a really cool person. And y\\'know you had 29 years to find that out, but you didn’t even try! Y\\'know what, you walked out on me, and I’m just, I’m gonna do the same thing to you.  I don’t ever want to see you again!  Well, umm, my Mom’s friend, Phoebe, is actually my birth Mom.  No. I’m just, I wanna, I need to be alone.  Okay, well umm, I know that we haven’t talked in a long time, but umm okay, our Mom is not our birth Mom. This-this other lady is our birth Mom.  I can’t believe you didn’t tell me there was a suicide note!  I, umm, shut up!  Noooo!!  No. I’m-I’m to depressed to talk.  Okay, bye.  No.  But, it’s not like we’re losing anything. Y\\'know?  It’s not like we-we know each other or anything. Or that have anything in common.  I-I like pizza!  Oh my God, so do I!  Wait-wait-wait, wait! Puppies. Cute or ugly?  Uh-huh, well! But umm, still I’m-I’m mad at you.  Well umm, do you wanna get something to eat? I’m kinda hungry.  All right, stop it. Now you’re just doing it to freak me out.  Hey!  And who else is going to be there?  Yeah, and-and leaving us to go see hot dancer girls is not very Thanksgivingy.  Rach, Rach, I just remembered. I had a dream about Mr. Geller last night.  Yeah, I dreamt that he saved me from a burning building and he was so brave and so strong! And it’s making me look at him totally differently. Y’know, I mean he used to be just, y’know “Jack Geller Monica and Ross’s dad” and now he’s he’s “Jack Geller, dream hunk.\"  Rachel?  Monica, leave him alone!  So, now, Rach, this is a traditional English trifle, isn’t it?  Wow. So then did you make it with beef or Eggplant?  I dunno, let’s see! So, okay, I dreamt that we were gonna get married, and he left, becuz he had to go fight a fire. And, um, so okay, I went to a night club, and I saw him making out with a girl.  Yeah, but then Jacques Cousteau came and he kicked his ass for betraying me! It was soo cool! Then, he took me diving and he introduced me to his pet seahorse, who, by the way, was totally coming on to me, and please, that is not gonna happen.  Five minutes ago, a line like that would’ve floored me. Now nothing. Well, not nothing, I am still a woman.  It\\'s so obvious, why doesn\\'t he just ask?  You too!  Ooh! That\\'s a good one! Mine is to pilot a commercial jet.  Maybe your resolution is to not make fun of your friends, especially the ones who may soon be flying you to Europe for free on their own plane.  Really?! How come?  Do you want me to teach you? I\\'m a great teacher.  Well, I taught me and I love me.  Hey!  Hey everybody, Rachel was so good today. She didn\\'t gossip at all.  Did you, did you touch any of the guitars while you were there? Did you?!  Then don\\'t touch one!!  Then do Iceberg!  No, but you\\'re questioning my method!  Y\\'know none of my other student thought I was stupid.  Yeah, well, y\\'know maybe you just need to try a little harder!  Fine! You go learn from your qualified instructor! But don\\'t come crying to me when everyone\\'s sick and tired of hearing you play Bad, Bad Leroy Brown!!  No, I can\\'t talk to you! I don\\'t have a fancy ad in the Yellow Pages!  Uh-huh!  No!  Yeah!  Okay, I\\'m gonna go too. I\\'m gonna go to the airport. I figure if I hang around there long enough, someone\\'s bound to leave one of those planes unattended.  Hey! It\\'s raining. I don\\'t want to fly in the rain. So…  Hey!  Dinner was good!  I’m just saying hi! Now I’m gonna go!  Oh, so you\\'re Monica’s boss?  Oh! I sous stand.  Oh you…you made pesto?  Would you say your pesto is the best-o?  I made it myself.  Well, it’s no pesto.  Ooh Monica!  Oh my God! I had the best time with Tim last night. He is so sweet! Oh, I can’t wait to get sous-neath him.  But why?!  Well maybe he was just nervous, y’know you can be very intimidating. And besides I’ve met your pastry chef and she can stand to be taken down a peg or two.  But Monica, he loves his job so much! Can you just give him another chance? Please?  That’s fair! Thank you so much. Thanks. Oops, it looks like when he got the pastry chef he got you a little bit too.  Love it!  Hey!  But…  Okay. Okay, but you can’t fire him today.  Because I’m dumping him today.  You can’t fire him and dump him the same day, he’ll kill himself.  Are you kidding?! Another week with that sip, I’ll kill myself!  Okay. But the question is who’s gonna go first. ‘Cause whoever goes second is the bitch.  Come on! The boss that fires a guy that’s just been dumped, bitch! And the woman who dumps a guy that’s just been fired, blond bitch!  Hi.  It will be…in a minute. Listen, Tim you’re a really great guy.  Oh-oh no she doesn’t! I know what that is. You can stay.  Monica!  I’m, I’m breaking up with you.  I’m sorry, I’m just—I’m…I’m just not ready for a relationship right now.  Oh that’s good, the chemistry thing for us too.  Ross, I know what you’re thinking.  That she’s gonna move in with you and maybe then she’ll fall in love with you and then when she finds out you’re already married, she’ll just be happy. Y’know? You’re just, you’re very sad.  What?!!  Yeah, Professor and Mrs.  Oh! Yeah, y’know you and Ross are still married.  Just kidding!  Hi.  Well, you know that psychic I see?  Well, she told me that I’m gonna die this week, so I’m kinda bummed about that.  Yeah, and I know you guys don’t know a lot about psychic readings, but that one is pretty much the worse one you can get.  I don’t—she said y’know that I’d have triplets! But she also said one of them would be black.  Oh, this is it. This what’s gonna kill me.  Hey!  I was preparing you for my—didn’t you think I was dead? Did that not come off?  Yeah, thanks. And listen, can you do me a favor? Could you just umm, wake me up in a couple hours, y’know if you can.  Hey!  What’s going on?  Hey! Maybe you’ll die!  No, we can go together! Just don’t wait too long though, okay? ‘Cause I’m outta here sometime before Friday.  No-no, it’ll be fun! We can come back and we can haunt these guys!  Listen to this! My reading was wrong, I’m not going die!  Because my psychic is dead! She must’ve read the cards wrong!  Eh, better her than me! Hey, let’s bake cookies!  Have you really done this before?  Hey!  We’re just celebrating that Joey got his health insurance back.  Oh! Since tomorrow. I met this really cute guy in the park and he like y\\'know, jogs, and blades, and swims, and so y\\'know we made a deal that’s he’s going to teach me all sorts of jock stuff.  I’m going to let him.  Oh, there’s no such thing as an innocent burger.  Um, Chandler, Ross, this is Robert.  I’ll have coffee.  Hey!  Oh, okay, I learned how to shoot a lay-up, a foul shot, and a twenty-three pointer.  Oh, I get more because I’m dainty.  Yeah, in the back. You want a quarter?  You guys!! Come on!  What do you mean?  Hey.  Hey. Ooh! Don’t sit down!  Yeah. And, first here’s a gift.  Listen, Robert’s gonna be here any second so, will one of you just tell him?  Please, right now, no, every time I see him it’s like ‘Is it on the lose?’ ‘Is it watching me?’  Hey.  No, I can spot you from here.  Okay, listen Robert...  Umm, I think you’re really, really great...  I-I-I-I-I don’t know, I don’t know what to say.  Hi, yeah, hi!

Ooh, it\\'s sympathy pains. Ohh, that\\'s so sweet!  No-no-no! We haven\\'t started yet. Where\\'s Alice?  Umm, sympathy pains.

Maybe I can, you don\\'t know!  Maybe not! Y\\'know? Seriously, three babies are a handful maybe they\\'re y\\'know, looking for a chance to unload one of them. Listen, I-I hate to miss an opportunity just because I didn\\'t ask! Y\\'know?  Oh, just ask him!  I can\\'t ask him! Do you have any idea how inappropriate that would be?! All I\\'m saying is just talk to Frank. Okay? Just, y\\'know, feel him out!  You\\'re right.  Tell him it\\'s for you.  Well, I\\'m kinda on a clock here.  Undo it. Undo it. Undo it.  Hi!

Yes!  Yeah.  Thank you!  I’m not gonna right to you! That’s not real!  Yeah, I think we are.  Well, at least you didn’t rent yours from a store called, \"It’s Not Too Late.\"  Me too.  Me too.  Okay.  Yay!  I hate my regular clothes now! Y’know? I look down and-and I know that this isn’t gonna be the most special day of my life.  I guess.  Oh my God!  Oh, you’re such a cheater!  Hey!  Oh, how’d that happen?  What is that?  Oh, how did it go?  What did he say?  Yeah, maybe.  Any luck?  No, yeah! The groom cannot see the bride!  Not after this!  Ready?  Okay.  it\\'s...  and…  please...  leave…  Yeah, I know because you have all the good words. What do I get? I get \"it’s,\" \"and\" oh I\\'m sorry, I have \"A.\" Forget it.

Let\\'s run towards them!  All right, wait just one more second. Hi, it\\'s Phoebe and Rachel\\'s. Please leave a message, thanks!  Uh-huh. You\\'ve met your match Rachel Green.  I have to tie my shoe, so you go ahead, I\\'ll catch up.  Hey!  Why? Why would you do that?  Sure  So, what should you have done?  Uh-Huh, Which is...?  So?  Why do you care?  But people that you don\\'t know and will never see again.  Hey!  See? And you don\\'t care if people are staring, it\\'s just for a second cause then you\\'re gone!  Woo-hoo, first weekend away together!  Oh, Paolo, hi, what are you doing here?  Well, Racquela\\'s right, yeah!  Oh, okay, I don\\'t know what you just said, so let\\'s get started.  Um, that\\'s really your decision, I mean, some people prefer, you know, to take off...oh whoops! You\\'re being naked!  Fine!  Nothing, I\\'m sorry, I\\'m just, I\\'m out of sorts.  All right, you know Paolo?  Well, he made a move on me.  Oh, boy scouts could have camped under there.  Uma Thurman.  She is gonna hate me.  Hey!  Are you moving out?  Um, um, Rachel can we talk for a sec?  Oh, I don\\'t make them a lot because I don\\'t think it\\'s fair to the other cookies  Which proves that I never lie.  Paolo made a pass at me.  Are you okay?  I\\'m so embarrassed, I\\'m the one he hit on!  No, wait, oh, what are we sorry about?  Such a pig!  Oh he\\'s like a...  ...like a...  Yes, good! Ok...  The end.  Should I not have told you?  I think she took it pretty well. You know Paolo\\'s over there right now, so...  Ooh!  Oh, ok bye-bye.  You ok?  Yep!  Always.  What?!  Ross?!  Don’t be worried about that! Your tombstone can say whatever you want it to say! It could say, Ross Geller, Good at Marriage! Y’know? Mine’s gonna say Phoebe Buffay, Buried Alive.  So okay what? You’re gonna be married to a girl who doesn’t even know about it?!—Op, woman! Sorry.  Hey Rach!  Sorry, mix up. Hey, how was the movie?  Hey!  No, why?  Ooh! That’s good! Wow! But now if you were pregnant, what would you name it? Hint: Phoebe.  Guys, I’m happy too.  Hmm, something bad to tell Rachel… Bad news for Rachel, what could that be?!  Ross, it’s not that big a deal! So you’ll been divorced three times, you’ll still have a life, you’ll go on dates…  Ross, you’re being ridiculous! Okay? You are cute and smart and sweet and that is much more important than three stupid divorces!  Y’know that’s really fair. Y’know? Most guys who have been divorced three times are like 60. Ross, nobody cares about this except you! This-this embarrassment thing is all in your head! Here, I’ll show you! Come here.  Okay, so what do you think ladies? Who wouldn’t be interested? Who wouldn’t want to date him?  Well, I thought you loved her when you-when you married her.  Hey! You could do a lot worse than Joey Tribbiani!!  Yes, and now he’s using this three divorces reason because he wants to stay married to her because he loves her. I must say, \"Well done!\" Bravo Meg.  So? Did you get the annulment?  I knew it! Because you love Rachel.  Yeah, complicated ‘cause of the love.  I’ve never been more convinced of your love for her.  Oh we do, but not just yet.  Okay umm, well, first Chandler and Monica will get married and be filthy rich by the way. Yeah. But it won’t work out.  I know. Then, I’m gonna marry Chandler for the money and you’ll marry Rachel and have the beautiful kids.  But then we ditch those two and that’s when we get married. We’ll have Chandler’s money and Rachel’s kids and getting custody will be easy because of Rachel’s drinking problem.  I don’t want to go into the whole thing, but umm, we have words and I kill him.  Oooh, I love family traditions like that. When uhm... when Ursula and I were kids, on our birthday, our stepdad would sell his blood to buy us food!  Oh, COOL!! Wow, it\\'s like a time capsule!  Oh, just think... she\\'s gonna be watching that video on a TV that hasn\\'t even been invented yet! With friends who right now are just like babies! And they\\'ll be living in a floating city that the humans built to escape the ant people!  Yeah! I wrote Emma a song.  Joey, it\\'s a birthday party.  So you’re gonna... hit on her?  Oh!  Or you could stick a fork in an apple!  Separate performances.  Sure, yeah!  And you know, I have a massage client soon.  Well, if you\\'re leaving, I\\'m definitely gonna go.  No, it did not.  Joey? How could you just let them leave?  Wh.. what? No wait, you don\\'t get to leave! I\\'ve got a massage client waiting outside my door any minute!  Well, oh, ok now... Only one of us has to stay with Emma. Ok, and as the person who realized that, I get to go!  No, lets just draw straws.  Ok! I want the dolphin!  I\\'m too excited!  Go! Go!  Good job Alan!  Yeah, see you later!  Hey, are Ross and Rachel back?  Oh good, I didn\\'t miss the party.  I just felt so bad, missing this. So I just slipped him a little something, you know. As long as I\\'m back in five or six hours, it will be alright.  Hey!  Hey, why are you mopping your ceiling?  Wow, I have the spirit of an old Indian women living in mine.  The mailman was downstairs, so I brought up your mail.  Now what is Fabutec?  Waxine!!  Oh, it’s incredible! I so want to be a Waxine girl.  God. Do think it really doesn’t hurt? ‘Cause how can they do that?  They have the best stuff in there.  Grasp one of the linen strips by its ‘easy grab tab’ and pull it off in one quick pain free motion.  Was it not pain-free?  Huh, well, the girls in the satin nighties on the commercial don’t seem to think it’s that bad.  Oh!!  Ow!!!  We’re all right.  We’re all right.  For your information, this happens to be a pain like no man will ever experience.  Uh-huh.  Whe-where did he put it?!  Oh, I knew something had to be wrong, because my fingernails did not grow at all yesterday.  Should we do something?  Hi, it’s Phoebe. Listen someone’s gonna have to take my 9:00 with Mr. Rehack, ‘cause it’s like 9:15 now, and I’m not there.  We could eat the wax! It’s organic.  No, not the used wax.  They’re gonna get through this, aren’t they?  Yeah, y\\'know, people can be so self-involved.  They’ve been quiet for a long time.  I can see that, \\'cause they both have those big brown eyes and, ya know, the little pouty chin.  Ooh, where are you off to, Travelin\\' Jake?  Oh, oh, OK, so everyone, pretend like I\\'m telling you a story, OK. And, and it\\'s really funny. So everyone just laugh, now.  Hi Rob Dohnen.  Oh, wow.  Oh, I would love to have kids. . . you\\'re, you\\'re the, you\\'re, me play the songs that I will write for them.  I know.  No, uh-uh, I\\'m just, I\\'m nervous. So, you know what, maybe if I just, if I picture them all in their underwear.  I\\'m just, I\\'m, I\\'m, I\\'m used to playing for grown-ups. Ya know, they just, grown-ups drink their coffee and do their grown-up thing, ya know, and kids listen. This is a huge responsibility. What? Are you gonna kiss me?  Thank you for coming everybody. There\\'re cookies in the back.  Yay, I rock.  But.  I sense these things. It was either but or butter.  I can do that.  Yeah.  Thinkin\\' about it.  OK, hi again.  Today we\\'re gonna start with some songs about barnyard animals.  Fired! Why?  I can\\'t believe it. Did you tell your board about how kids want to hear the truth?  I see.  No. What do you, what do you want me to be, like some stupid, big, like, purple dinosaur?  Who\\'s Barney.  OK, Rachel, I\\'m ready.  Um, yeah I guess that\\'s me.  OK. Um, how come I\\'m walking with you?  I know. Oh, like you would drink her coffee after what you did to her with Van Damme.  Stick a fork what?  Oh, OK, I don\\'t eat meat.  Well you know, you juist, you eat them and you can tell.  Oh, you just know.  OK, Rachel, why don\\'t you start talking first.  Alright Monica, if there is something that you would like to share...  OK, now I\\'m gonna kick some ass.  Alright, now I will let go if you both stop.  There we go.You know what, if we were in prison, you guys would be, like, my bitches.  Oh alright, stop, STOP THE MADNESS. This is crazy. Who can even remember why this even started in the first place?  Yes that\\'s right. But still, I-, look at your purse, look at your sweater, look at yourselves.  I\\'m almost done with it, keep your panties on.  You know, I think I want to write a song about all this.  Yeah. Oh, except one of the strings on my guitar is broken. Hey, Chandler, can I borrow your G-string?  About 20 minutes. CLOSING CREDITS  Yeah, my mom used to put her head in the oven. Well, actually, she only did it the one time. But it was pretty weird.  Okay, okay, but Rachel’s gonna be here too, can’t I just ask her this stuff?  Ohhh, I wanna come over there and give you a hug and wish you luck on your wedding, but I don’t—can’t get up.  Great! Yeah, could you bring me the newspaper?  Oh, have a great wedding!  Oh, hey, Chandler I wanna hug you too!  Oh, and great! You might as well bring me my book, it’s on the counter in your apartment.  Oh, do you need a hug? You don’t have to bring me anything!  Oh. Oh.  Oh, no. Oh, nothing.  Okay, I have a wedgie.  So-so, what do you want for lunch?  Yeah, I do. What’s the matter?  Eh, don’t be so hard on yourself. If someone I was still in love with was getting married…  Yeah!  Oh. No. No. Good! Yeah, me neither.  We thought you knew!  Yeah, we all know! We talk about it all the time!  Oh no, Ross doesn’t know anything.  Well, because we thought you knew!! It’s so obvious! God, that would be like telling Monica, \"Hey, you like things clean.\"  Hey!  So, did shopping make you feel any better about Ross?  Well, I think I can help you get over him.  Yeah. I just need you to bring me some photos of Ross.  And a small piece of chocolate.  Uh, only if you have the hiccups too. Yeah, the pictures are for you, the water and the chocolate is for me. I just didn’t feel like getting up. Okay, I’m gonna show you a picture of Ross. Okay? And you’re going to remember all of the bad things about him. All right? Really focus on his flaws.  Okay, this is going to be harder than I thought. Umm, let’s try some uh, aversion therapy.  Okay?  So uh, now look at the picture…  Okay, how do you feel now?  Hello.  Hey, Joey! Hey! Ooh! Ooh! I just say someone on the—that looks just like you on the subway. And I was gonna go over and say ‘hi!’ but then I figured, he doesn’t care if he looks like you.  Ohh, they’re having a great time with their Aunt Phoebe! Aunt Rachel hasn’t been helpful at all. So, do you miss me?  So you’re not homesick yet?  All right, the seven of us miss you.  Y’know, me, Rachel, the birds, the babies…  Ooh, the pizza guy’s here!  Yeah. But y’know we were thinking about you, y’know we ordered the Joey Special.  Yep! Okay, gotta go, talk to you later.  Yeah?  Yeah, it’s in the guys’ apartment under the sink. Why?  What?! What do you mean you’re going to London?  I—Rachel, you can’t go! Ross loves Emily!  That’s not why you’re going! You’re going because you hope he’s gonna say, \"Yeah, I love you too, Rach. Forget that British chippy.\"  No! Because he’s in love with the British chippy! Look, Rachel, if you go, you’re just gonna mess with his head and ruin his wedding! Y’know, it’s too late! You missed you’re chance! I’m sorry, I know this must be really hard, it’s over.  Oh...yes..is this..umm..Emily’s Parents’ house.  No no no, I’ll be nice, I swear!!!   Could you just give me the number for where they are?  Ok, somebody is on their way to ruin wedding okay. And I have to warn somebody, alright. So if you don’t give me that number then I’m going to come over there and kick your snooty ass all the way to New Glocken..shire.  Hello, Hello. Ohh, OHH, she knew I could kick her ass.  Oh, hi, Mrs. Waltham. I need to speak with ether one of the best men, or Ross’s sister Monica.  Oh, I’m Phoebe Buffay. I’m one of Ross’s best friends.  Yeah, um, I can’t fly. I’m having my brother’s babies.  No..umm, could I talk to one of them? It’s very very important.  Ohh! Okay, I’m going to have to kick her ass too.  I don’t want to hear about her!!  No! No, we have an emergency. Okay? Rachel’s coming to London.  No it’s not great. No, she’s coming to tell Ross that she loves him.  I KNOW THAT!!! You have to stop her!! She’s going to ruin the wedding!!  All right, so, okay...  Okay, so I’m done my part, okay. It’s your responsibility now, okay. The burden is off me, right?  So tell me about this girl?  Mrs. Waltham. Hi. It’s Phoebe again.  Yea. Can I please, please, please talk to one of the best men? This is going to be the last time I promise.  Did you stop Rachel?  So nothing got ruined?  Oh that’s so great! Ohh, so what’s going on now?  What?!  I call their apartment!!!  It\\'s so weird seeing Ross and Rachel with a baby. It\\'s just so grown up.  Look at you all grown up.  You know, I might know somebody. Hey, how about you set me up with someone, and we double date!  Done. Oh good, really?  Yeah... All right, well that rules out Lana Titweiller  Ooh, great! Just the reaction I was hoping for.  Of course not! And you\\'re gonna love Mary Ellen. She\\'s really smart and cute and funny, and I can\\'t tell you how I know this, but she\\' not opposed to threesomes. So tell me some about my guy.  Come on, give me something. What\\'s his name?  Mike? Okay! What\\'s his last name?  All right, we\\'ll se you and Mike at the restaurant in a couple hours.  Joey, this is Mary Ellen Jenkins. So, Mike, how do you and Joey know each other anyway?  Wow, you guys go way back then. So what are you up to these days?  Wow, that\\'s great! I liked that better than the law thing, so...  You know, it\\'s so surprising that you and Joey have known each other for so long and I\\'ve never heard about you.  What?!  Do you not know each other?  Mike, let me ask you something. How many sisters does Joey have?  Joey, why did you set me up with a stranger?  Sure.  Why did you go along with that?  Prove it.  That wouldn\\'t stand in the way of a true pianist.  You are really good! I play a little guitar myself.  Uhuh.  Well, like acoustic folksy stuff. You know? But right now I\\'m working on a couple \\'Iron Maiden\\' covers.  It\\'s okay. Go ahead, ask me out.  Bye Chandler.  Look at all the stuff people sent!  She’s just so cute! I just wanna bite her ear off and use it and a sucking candy.  Wow you guys got a hospital?  Fancy!  I dunno, well he got over the \"We were on a break\" thing really quickly.  You know that’s… that’s her.  Oh no, Rach, no no, you know you’re never supposed to wake a sleeping baby.  I can say I told you so but she’s kinda doing that for me.  It really does… how long do you think we have to stay?  Well, alright, we already tried feeding her, changing her, burping her, oh try this one! Go back in time and listen to Phoebe!  Yeah, no kidding, this just proves no good can come from having sex with Ross!  Alright you guys, we can’t turn on each other, Okay?  That’s just what she wants.  Oh I’m kinda part of this.  I knew I should have married Chandler.  Alright, I’ll try, fine! Yes, Okay!  You must be a fireball in bed.  Hi.  Breaking up sucks! Oh, I really miss Mike!  Well no, when I get to the point where... you know... I\\'m ready to hear cruel mocking jokes about Mike... I\\'m gonna come to you.  Ok. I mean I know I did the right thing. You know, Mike never wants to get married and I shouldn\\'t be in a relationship that has no future... but... pretty soon I\\'m gonna miss him so much. I\\'m gonna wanna see him again and you have to stop me from doing that.  That was a test and you just failed.  God, I wish Mike were here.  I gotta call him. Just to talk to him, there\\'s no harm in that.  Here.  Yes.  Yes, it reminds me of a simpler time.  You can\\'t have it.  Damn you Monica Geller hyphen Bing!  You know, it\\'s a lot less surprising to do that after I\\'ve buzzed you into the building.  Those are my shoes.  Monica, I really appreciate you checking in on me, but I\\'m actually feeling a lot better. Yeah, I just kinda want to be alone right now.  I ordered Chinese food.  What are the chances? 1 billion Chinese people and they send Mike!?  I\\'m sorry, I broke down... I wanted to see him.  There is a speakerphone on the base unit...  Not if nothing happens. Why can\\'t... why can\\'t we just hang out as friends?  Sit down.  Thanks, you look good too.  So how\\'s the piano playing going?  I\\'ve missed you too.  I know, I want that too, but IS that going to make it too hard?  What?  Who is this?  Oh, look, he\\'s got Ross\\'s haircut!  Wow, ooh, you\\'re gonna be making money hand over fist!  Hey.  How long did you think this barbecue was gonna last?  Jeez, you say one thing, and...  Oh, well, see, there\\'s this guy she met at the...  Oh, hey, y\\'know what? Tell them that bone story.  Oh, it\\'s Dr. Seuss!  Remembered what?  Oh, it\\'s so pretty. This must have cost him a fortune.  I know. This is really, really huge.  Nuh-uh. I don\\'t think any of our lives are ever gonna be the same ever again.  Here, look, alright, does this help?  Yeah, but, y\\'know, it\\'s... it would be like starting on the fifteenth date.  No, I mean, I mean, when you\\'re at the fifteenth date, y\\'know, you\\'re already in a very relationshippy place. Y\\'know, it\\'s... you\\'re committed.  Well, I mean, then what happens if it doesn\\'t work out?  Maybe there\\'s someone else.  Yeah, oh I’m sorry, it must be really hard to hear! I tell ya, it’s a lot easier having three babies play Bringing in the Noise, Bringing in da Funk on your bladder! I’m so sick of being pregnant! The only happiness I get is from a cup of coffee, which of course is decaf, ‘cause—Oh! I’m pregnant!  I haven’t really had any yet.  One of the babies is kicking.  What the hell is this?! What, did you actually thought it would make me feel better to give me stuff that I can’t use for another two months?! This sucks! All right, what’s my next present?!  Hi, guys.  I-I wanted to apologise if I—y’know seemed a tad edgy yesterday at my shower. Y’know it’s just the hormones, y’know.  Good. Y’know—no-no, okay, it’s-it feels like everything’s been about me lately, so what’s happening with you?  Oh!  Wow! This reminds me of the time when I was umm, living on the street and this guy offered to buy me food if I slept with him.  Well, let’s see, it’s not. Really, like that. Because, you see that was an actual problem, and uh, yours is just like y’know a bunch of y’know high school crap that nobody really gives y’know…  Oh! No, I-I think I just had a contraction.  Yeah, I thought I had one a couple of minutes ago, and now I know that was definitely one.  No. It’s all right; it’s probably false labour. They said that, that can happen near the end, just somebody get the book.  Well, do you see any babies?  Okay, I guess. I mean… I don’t know, it’s just, I guess I know it’s going to be over soon.  I know. It’s just y’know usually when you’re, when you’re done with the pregnant thing, y’know, then you get to do the mom thing. I’m gonna be y’know, sitting around in my leather pants, drinking Tequila.  Okay that’s even sadder. Look, I know, I know what I got myself into, it’s just that now that they’re in me it’s like, it’s like I know them y’know, I mean-I mean, it’s just not gonna be easy when these little babies have to go away.  Yeah, okay.  Cool Aunt Phoebe. I am pretty cool!  They are gonna love me.  Thanks you guys! Again.  You’re the best. Thanks. Oh!  Just kidding. Ahh!  Got cha again, you guys are so easy.  Oo! You should have one of us do it!  No! No! It’s-it’s uh a real thing! Anyone can get ordained on the Internet and perform like weddings and stuff!  Yes! A friend of mine did it and it’s totally legal!  What?! No! It was my idea!  Oh, I have a headache. A horrible headache!  Oh my God, you’ve got to stop chattering!  What is it?  Oh.  It’s amazing! My headache is completely gone! What are those pills called?  Say what?  Why?  Okay, then I must be disoriented.  Did you ever feed him a poison capsule that made him bleed from the eyes?  Oh! Suddenly somebody knows all about the side affects!  I know! Robin is so gay!  Umm, do health inspectors work on commission?  It\\'s okay to laugh right?  Yum-my!  Oh yeah! I\\'d let him check out my kitchen floors.  Yeah, but then I can be you sidekick Vunda.  Okay, she would love that! Y\\'know, \\'cause you know all the clean places to eat.  Okay.  Shiny.  Why?!  Oh, I took Larry there to eat but it was all violated. So we shut it down!  Ooh, absolutely!  Enh. Sure!  Okay, stop! Larry, okay, can\\'t you just be Larry and not Larry the health inspector guy? Y\\'know I mean it was really exciting at first but now it\\'s like, okay, so where are we gonna eat ever?  What are you doing?  Oh! You got it?!  The next, next?  What’s the matter?  Grandma’s gonna have to get in line.  Hey the wedding is so close! Are you getting nervous?  Sure.  Hey!  Yeah!  What?!  Well when can we have this shower?  Well that’s only two days away. What is the other option?  Well if we make it yesterday, woo-hoo! We’re done!  Rachel, calm down!  Oh okay. All right, then I need to calm down a little.  Uh, here. What time?  Finger sandwiches and tea.  And chili!  Both!  Neither.  Lusts of the flesh.  Hey! I’ve got a great idea for party favors for the shower. Okay, we get some uh mahogany boxes and carve everyone’s names in them and inside is everyone’s individual birth stone.  Okay. Okay! Well okay, who do we know that’s coming? Me. Are you?  Hey!  Hi!  Who the hell are all these people?  Hmm, y’know there’s another word for people like that. Losers!  You were supposed to tell her!  Fine, I’ll go call her.  And then for forgetting to invite you to it.  Yeah. Well, we called everyone in your phone book and bunch of people came, but it took us so long to get you here that they-they had to leave.  We ruined everything.  Sur-surprise.  Cassie, are you finding everything okay in there?  I started that!  Oh I know, I’ve been there. I remember toward the end…  Or you can do volunteer work.  Mon, maybe one of these guys wants to wear your dress.  I don’t know. I-I think it’s still gonna be a while.  You’re on!  One hundred thousand dollars!  Fine! I’ll call Zurich and move some money around.  Oh hey Mon? Rach is here! Ohh, you’re still pregnant. Oh, I’m sorry. I know how uncomfortable you are. Y’know what? You look great. Yeah, like fifty bucks.  It’s interesting that you lost. Now, I forget, do you like to lose?  Fine! You’re on!  Good God man don’t anger it.  Oh I-I don’t know about that. No, I think that if the two of you had sex the-the-the repercussions would be catastrophic.  Thank you!  Okay.  Is Rachel having the baby?  They’re at the coffeehouse.  Do you think they have yesterday\\'s daily news?  Just wanna check my horoscope, see if it was right.  We should do something. Whistle.  Come on, do it.  Do it!  Do it do it do it!  I can\\'t believe you did that!  Maybe nobody\\'s tried this.  Yeah, but did you see the dents in his knuckles? That means he\\'s artistic.  Oh! And, he\\'s the kinda guy who, when you\\'re talking, he\\'s listening, y\\'know, and not saying \\'Yeah, I understand\\' but really wondering what you look like naked.  I know.  Yeah, we-we feel kinda responsible.  Hey hey hey! She\\'s on!  Your mom was arrested?  What about Glen? He could be a Glen.  Ooh! How about Agamemnon?  I\\'m in.  Hi.  Nothing, I just thought I\\'d stop by.. y\\'know, after the uh... that I.. y\\'know, so what are you doing here?  Hello.  Going to the hospital tonight?  No, you?  Alright, whadyou do with him?  Look at you! How, how do you feel?  I\\'m Phoebe Buffay.  Well, we both have.  Well, actually it\\'s just from me.  You know who shaved you? That was me.  You\\'re welcome.  What, that\\'s it?  I don\\'t think you mean that.  Y\\'know what? We thought you were different. But I guess it was just the coma.  Well, all right. 1700 bags of peanuts flying that high, that’s pretty amazing too.  Oh! I won’t say, ‘no’ to a movie!  Shh! Get me out of here.  Don’t interrupt me!!  Oh my God! How did you get back here?!  That’s not mine.  How do you know?  Okay do you—Okay, do you have a search warrant? Because the last time I checked this was still America!  That is nice and we’re done. TADA!  Yeah, Chandler why don’t you take a walk? This doesn’t concern you.  No-no, we do it every year!  No, yeah, we never find them! She’s always best at us that wily minx.  But we have to!  Well then, you should look with us.  Ooh ooh, we have a live one!  Ooh, who’s it for?  Uh-oh. She may be onto us.  Yeah, and you have nothing to worry about \\'cos they\\'re all crap!  Ohhh. Thanks Chandler they\\'re great!  Oh, okay, I\\'m sorry, thank you for my azzz.  Hey! Look who I found!  Y’know, birds have a very good sense of direction, and I thought maybe they could help us find where the presents are hidden.  Or we could just follow your clever jokes – any ideas? No! Didn’t think so! Okay, c’mon guys, show us where the presents are!  Hmm, how about my azzz?  What?  No, don’t look directly at them!  Alright, no, we could look at them!  Oh, this one’s for Chandler. Here.  And the big one’s for me!  Hee hee!  Will you get us better gifts?  Oh yes, I see what you mean. That look is priceless.  Oh. Oh! Ma\\'am? Excuse me, ma\\'am?  You can\\'t put your cigarette out on a tree!  No but you shouldn\\'t! Don\\'t ever do that again.  Save it Red! Unless you wanna spend the night in the slammer, you apologize to the tree.  Okay, cancel backup! Cancel backup!  I know but I\\'m having so much fun doing good deeds.  Excuse me, is this your car?  Well I don\\'t think it\\'s very nice of you to park here, y\\'know you\\'re blocking the entrance.  I-I\\'m with the umm, the 57th.  I\\'m in vice. Yeah, in fact I\\'m undercover right now. I\\'m a whore.  Umm, do you know, umm Sipowicz?  Yeah, big guy, kinda bald.  Ooh, God, it\\'s him! It\\'s that cop! God, I can\\'t believe it! He found me!  Yep! As long as you understand that I\\'m going to call my lawyer and once he puts you on the stand he\\'ll make you look like a fool. A fool!  I would love it if I weren\\'t here!  Me?!  Wow! I didn\\'t see that coming! You\\'re-you\\'re asking me out!  Umm, yeah, I\\'d like to go out with you officer…  Gary.  Yeah! So--ooh, I gotta ask you though. How did you know where to find me?  Ohh, impressive.  Yeah, we\\'ll talk at dinner.  All right, I can\\'t wait!  Now, have you told anyone else?  You told me.  Yeah well, once again not knocking pays off. I only wish you hadn’t been on the toilet.  Hey! So Chandler, wanna go to the coffeehouse?  Yeah, coffeehouse.  So how are things going with Paul?  That’s easy! You just have to think of him as a-as a jar of pickles that won’t open.  No that’s what you do when you want to get the truth out of someone.  Hi Paul!  So how are things going with you?  Yeah! That was so weird, huh?  I didn’t do it! It was Chandler! He’s… He’s mad at you!  Please, I think you know why.  Come on Ross, you’re a paleontologist, dig a little deeper.  Do you think that’s something that he’d be mad at you for?  Well then I think that’s it.  Oh, if that’s what you want you then you really should run his head under hot water and bang his head against a table.  Okay, so maybe you don’t get her a ring. Maybe you-maybe you do something different. Y’know? Maybe you get her an engagement bracelet, y’know? Or an engagement tiara? Or—ooh! An engagement Revolutionary War musket! (Picks one up from the display in the corner.  Huh? Can you just imagine getting down on one knee and handing her this gorgeous piece of weaponry?  Or not, whatever.  We will give you $10.  We stand firm at $10.  I’ll give you $1 for them.  Oh my God Chandler, the one you picked is gone. It’s over!  The little jail between the doors!  I know, I’m sorry! But y’know, this ring is better! Monica never even saw the other ring.  Maybe it was the guy.  It’s not a stupid gumball machine looking ring! It’s a beautiful ring!  Okay. There may be a way that we can get the other ring back. ‘Cause I heard the guy tell the jeweler where he was going to propose. So maybe we can get him to trade rings or something.  Well you certainly can’t give her that stupid gumball ring.  Wow! You’re good! After this, we should solve crimes.  It is your office.  John?  Wow! I would trade.  Yeah, do you want to break a dying woman’s heart?  Yes, and it is my dying wish to have that ring. See, if I’m not buried with that ring then my spirit is going to wander the nether world for all eternity…  What?  Oh I know, I helped pick out the ring.  Why don’t you go up there and ask him to ‘step lightly, please?’  Well, he’s very charming.  Well, you’re just gonna have to try.  Well, I have ah, vodka and cranberry juice.  Wow. Okay, I don’t know how to talk to you.  Where’d you get too? We lost you after you opened up all the presents.  Why, what happened?  How can you not know which one?  We didn’t fool around with any of them. Dwha! Dwha!  Ick, you were eavesdropping.  Oh, I’m sorry. But I really like this guy. And I think he really happens to like me.  Thanks you guys! Thank you.  God, I hope they kick his ass!  Hey!  I would, but I get my morning sickness in the evening.  Unless! She wants to spend the night holding my hair back for me.  Don’t you just love the way they talk?!  Ohh!  It kicked! I think the baby kicked!  Oh no wait, oh no, the elastic on my underwear busted.  Why?  Ohh! So, did you get to meet her?  That’s short for Phoebe?! I thought that was just what we called each other!  Shhh!! Please! What’s he saying?  What? Oh my God!  Well, look, why don’t you just, why don’t you do your Phase Two strip club thing with us.  Come on! Let us be guys! Maybe we want to be guys!  Y’know you, you just stop being such a wuss and get those off and you come with us and watch naked girls dance around!!  Oh, no umm, hi, that-that, you have to put that out, ‘cause I’m pregnant.  Come on! Look where you are!!  Remember, a virgin for me please.  Well, if you think it will help.  You should! How is she?  Who, Josh?  Oh no! Wait! Wait! Okay, y’know what, you were right, you were right. We really weren’t great at being guys, but you know why? Because we’re girls.  And do you know what girls are really good at?  No, listening! Sit! Y’know, maybe it would just really, really help if you would just talk.  Yeah, I really liked that fighter pilot one.  Yeah.  Oh! What is that? What is that?  Hey—ooh so, how was Vermont?  Does anyone wanna watch TV?  Monica your remote doesn\\'t work.  Oh. Aw, forget it.  Wow! See, and I didn\\'t think you\\'d be able to come up with anything.  I don\\'t know about that. I\\'ve got one that\\'s worse.  Oh, did the little rich boy have a problem with the butler? Yes, mine\\'s worse!  Oh, this life! Oh okay no, Chandler\\'s is worse.  Of course you don\\'t sweetie. You\\'re brand new.  Oh no, I know! I know! It\\'s the one where Joey got Monica\\'s turkey stuck on his head!  Joey? What\\'s going on?  Oh my God!  Oh my God! Monica\\'s gonna totally freak out!  Well, of course it smells really bad. You have your head up a dead animal.  Hey!  No, it\\'s not supposed to be funny, it\\'s supposed to be scary.  All right, hold on! Okay, let\\'s just all think.  Oh wait! That can\\'t be the one Rachel\\'s talking about. She didn\\'t even know that happened. So which one was it?  Oh, I can\\'t believe you called her fat.  Oh, no, I have the cutest Christmas story!  Fine, all right, mine had a dwarf that got broke in half, but y\\'know whatever.  Morning.  What\\'s that?  It\\'s a baby chick and duck!  I did not see that coming.  Yes.  That is the rule, though.  Guess what? You\\'re almost an uncle!  Yeah, and I have a definite feeling it\\'s gonna be a girl.  Have you seen him throw a ball?  What\\'s that smile? Did something happen with you two?  But do you wanna get back together?  Guess we\\'ll never know how it ends.  Ross, you\\'ve got to tell her how you feel!  Ross, Rachel doesn\\'t know that you wanna get back together. If she did, she might feel differently. She might not even go.  Can\\'t a girl finish a song around here?  Wow, eight hour flight with a one-year old? Good luck, mom.  Unbelievable!  Hey, what are you working on?  How sweet! Oh, is that the baby?  Hey. So, did you talk to Rachel?  What?  How can you compare yourself to Gunther? I mean, sure, he\\'s sexy in a more obvious way. You have a relationship with her, you slept together last night.  Uh, Joe?  No, you don\\'t! She\\'s going to Paris! She is going to meet somebody. Do you know how many hot guys there are in Paris? It\\'s... It\\'s a city of Gunthers!  Hey! What do you have there?  Honey, that\\'s gorgeous!  Yeah, did she sound happy about it? \\'Cause my friend Ethel\\'s baby was born with a teeny, tiny beard.  Oh, Jack Bing. I love that. Ooh, it sounds like a \\'40s newspaper guy, you know? \"Jack Bing, Morning Gazette. I\\'m gonna blow this story wide open!\"  Oh yeah? Well, tell me which one, and I\\'ll try slip it in my coat.  One? How about a whole bunch?  Yeah! Ooh, we could teach them to sing, and we can be like the Von Trapp family! Only without the Nazis. Although that sounds kinda dull.  So, you just let her go?  But now she\\'ll never know how he feels!  Woo!  Wait, wait! Get your coat! Get your coat!  You didn\\'t bring one! My cab\\'s downstairs, I\\'ll drive you to the airport.  Hurry!  That\\'s okay. If - if we hit anything, the engine will explode, so you know, it\\'s better if you\\'re thrown from the car.  Okay!  I - I don\\'t take passengers.  My medallion number is, \"Get out of the cab!\"  Get out of the cab!  You can open your eyes now.  Yes.  Yes, she jumped right back up.  Do you wanna get to Rachel in time?  You should have thought of that before you got in!  Toll-booth.  Hurry!  Okay.  Damn, that window is clean.  Ross, where are you going?  What? What are you just gonna walk up to her at the gate? Have you never chased anyone through the airport before?  You have to get a ticket to get past security.  Not with that attitude! Now, haul ass!  Just one? I drive you all the way down here, and I don\\'t get to see how it works out?  We\\'re on our honeymoon.  I\\'m so lucky I married you.  No, did we miss it?  Maybe we have the flight-number wrong. God.  Hey, it\\'s me. Here\\'s Ross.  Well, I\\'ve never gone this fast before.  She\\'s got her cell, you could call her.  You don\\'t have any other choice!  Rachel? Oh, good. Hey, by the way, did you just get on the plane?  Uh, Rach, hang on.  Uhm, actually no. No, you\\'ve... You have to get off the plane.  I have this feeling that something\\'s wrong with it. Something is wrong with the left Philange.  I don\\'t see her.  There she is!  Okay, you\\'re on.  I\\'m sorry.  Hey.  Yeah, yeah, he talked to her, but she got on the plane anyway.  He went home. He didn\\'t want to see anybody.  Hey, do you realise that at one time or another we all lived in this apartment?  So, I guess this is it.  Yeah.  You mean like a doctor?  Oh my God!  Why don’t take care of this one, and should I get pregnant again, I’ll hold onto your card, okay?  Three? You guys were worried I wouldn’t even have one!  Well, yeah.  Oh my God! Oh my God! Oh my God!! So I-I mean so in a few months I’m going to have three full grown babies just walkin’ around inside me?! Oh! Oh! And it’s gonna be one of those log rides where they just come shooting out!  What do you know?!  Ooh! Hi!  Oh well, okay, hey, y’know how when you’re umm, you’re walking down the street and you see three people in a row, and you say, \"Oh, that’s nice?\"  Okay, yeah well, good news, you’re going to have three babies.  Oh God, I’m so glad you guys are happy, I was so afraid you were going to be all freaked.  No, no maybe ‘cause it’s harder to raise them, and the added expense, and…  No, back to happy. Back to happy!  No you can’t quit college! No! You’re in college? Really?  You can’t give up on your dream.  Hey.  Hi!  No!  No!  No-no, I know that, but I just have to make enough money for the second part of my plan.  My Saturn dealership.  Ooh-Ooh! I did it! I did it! I figured out a way to make money! I’m gonna open up my own massage place and Frank’s gonna help me! And! We can work it around his schedule so he doesn’t have to quit school!  I’m telling it! I’m telling it!  Okay. You know how people need transportation, but they also need massages to help them relax so I just figured we could combine the two, okay, I give the massages and Frank drives! I can fix up the van, bolt the table in the back, and you know what I’ve got?  No! Think about it, it’s a taxi that people take when they need to relax, it’s…  The name was my favourite part!  YOU DID NOT!!!! Oh! No! You came up with Relaxi Cab! That’s not good.  Hey, tell him about Relaxi-Taxi, and-and ask him if he thinks that’s better than Relaxi Cab.  Oh, that is better.  Hey! Check it out! This is unbelievable! Joey has been holding his breath for almost four minutes!  Uh-huh, what?  Oh!  Well, that would be great but then what do we do about Denise?  My roommate.  Yes, Denise. Denise!  Maybe because you never listen to anything that I say. I talk about her all the time! DENISE!!!!!  Hey.  So, what did Rachel say when you told her you were still married to her?  You didn’t tell her did you?  Of course not, because you’re in love with her.  What do you mean, comforted her?  Ah-ha! A classic sign of love, the hug!  Okay, just tell me this, did you or did you not smell her hair?  Okay, I didn’t understand that, but y’know, maybe that’s ‘cause you were speaking the secret language of love!  Shhhhhh! I’m swamped right now.  It worked!  I saw it.  Umm, I’m talking about that which you already know but won’t admit. You love her again; you re-love her!  What?!  Now if you want to receive e-mails about my upcoming shows, then please give me money so I can buy a computer.  Hey! New wallet, huh?  Oh please, somebody tell me I don’t have to go to work today!  Oh, my first massage today is this incredibly gorgeous guy, and every time I see him I just want to do things to him that I’m not allowed to charge for.  Oh no, it is forbidden! No-no, Mrs. Potter fires people for fooling around with clients. And it’s against my oath as a masseuse.  No, I made myself take an oath. Yeah, no fooling around with clients and umm, always be prepared. Yeah, that one’s actually from the Boy Scouts, but it just makes good sense.  Because it’s Arabian princess day at work! Okay?! Leave me alone!  These old things.  You mean the—Okay by siadic, you mean the towel covered portion.  No!  Ohh, you guys, remember that cute client I told you about? I bit him.  On the touchy.  No, I know! I-I’m sorry, but the moment I touch him, I just wanna throw out my old oath and take a new, dirty one.  Yeah! In… really long hour world.  Ugh, okay, I have an enormous crush on you. But because you’re a client, I can’t ask you out, even though you give me y’know, the feeling.  Really?!  What?  Oh yeah, oh and I know, but this isn’t what it looks like, ‘cause Rick is my ahh, husband.  Yes, I will tell her.  Hey! So I had a great day, Rick and I really hit it off, and we started making out, and then my boss walked in and fired me for being a whore.  It’s so weird, I have never been fired from anything before!  I just-I just started walking around not knowing what to do next, y’know? I-I started asking people on the street if they wanted massages. Then these policemen, thought I was a whore too. It’s been a really bad day, whore wise.  Yeah, they thought I was a whore.  Great! Thank you very much.  What’s the big deal, y’know? It’s not like it’s a real marriage.  Yeah, if you get married in Vegas, you’re only married in Vegas.  Oh my God!—Eh! Well…  Oh Joey, I’m so sorry. You want some of my breakfast?  What about my cab?  No, Joey! You borrowed my cab; you have to drive it back.  I don’t know, it’s such a long trip.  Are you asking me to have a frenaissance?  All right. Although I don’t think we need one, I never stopped loving you.  Um-hmm, yeah. They left me a message; they should be here any minute.  Well you don’t.  Good! Good! I was just testing you.  No, we were talking about tennis. Tennis is more believable.  Uh-huh! Ross invited us all to watch.  Oh-oh, that’s your thing.  You’re thing. You’re thing. Y’know? You’re the guy who gets divorced.  Well, you promised me a fun road trip! We’ve been on the road six hours and you’ve been asleep for five and a half! We are switching at the next rest stop and you are going to drive all the way back! That will be your punishment, you greedy sleeper!  Yeah! And until then you are going to sing to me because the radio’s broken and you are selfish but have a nice voice.  Sing!!  Do you like car games?  I love the license plate game!  Oh, okay.  And I have your name and the fact that you’re a drifter, so the ball’s pretty much in your court.  Stop it! Stop it no! That’s not fair! Y’know I can’t resist that beautiful voice!  You can still sleep at night and stuff.  Okay. Is it a kind of hot sandwich?  Is it a meatball sub?  No thanks, I’ve already seen one.  Always.  What?!  I have to tell you this story. Okay, I was coming over here and this driver…  What?  Oh. Ha-ha-ha. All right, anyway…  Yeah, so, he had a really funny hat—I don\\'t want to talk about it.  So you still hadn\\'t heard from Emily?  London is stupid! Stupid!  Oh… No, I did that for someone once and I\\'m not comfortable having that kind of power and control over someone\\'s life.  No. I\\'m sorry. It\\'s just \\'cause I couldn\\'t be there. \\'Cause all I ever get to do now is pregnant stuff, it just bums me out.  Well, it felt French.  Yeah?  Yeah?  Ohh, that\\'s so nice! How great! Well, where? Where\\'s the trip?!  That sucks! That\\'s not a trip! I just came from the park! What are we gonna high five about at the stupid Central Park? \"Well, it\\'s right by my house, all right!\"  That\\'s fine, just don\\'t bring it in my mouth.  Okay, woo! Hi.  Ooh, Atlantic City! Oh, that\\'s a great plan! Who\\'s plan was that?  Okay! Ooh-ahh, I\\'m gonna go pack. I\\'m gonna go pack my ass off!  Atlantic City, baby! Let\\'s roll some bones! Hey Joey, high-five for rolling bones!  Wow!  No! Barry and Mindy.  Which time?  What if I had taken that job at Merrill Lynch?  Yeah, I had a massage client who worked there and-and he said I had a knack for stocks.  Because at that time you see, I thought everything that rhymed was true. So I thought y’know that if I’d work with stocks, I’d have to live in a box, and only eat lox, and have a pet fox.  What?  Hi!  No! There-there was a little, a little diff in the market and I lost 13 million dollars.  What am I gonna do?! What am I gonna do?! I can’t call my office they’ll kill me! I can’t call my clients they’ll kill themselves! Great, now my chest hearts.  Oh, if I were, would-would I have shooting pains up and down my left arm?  Most people don’t like their jobs, I love my job! I have not been working for three hours and I’m already going crazy. I miss Joan.  Still going through that dry spell with Carol?  How long has it been since you had sex?  Oh that’s not so bad.  That is.  Maybe you need to spice things up a little.  I don’t know. You could tie her up, she could tie you up; you could eat stuff off each other…  Y’know, dirty talk, m�nage � trois, toys…  Roll playing… You could be the warden; she could be the prisoner. You could be the pirate; she could be the wench!  Oh yeah, the doctor said that could be one of the side effects.  No! It’s not a cigarette! The smoke is coming out of me!  Oh, give it to me.  Give it!  Was it my work? Were they mad? Was it Jack? Did he yell?!  Thank God.  Hey.  Well, I’ve got to get out of this bed, I’m going crazy here. Crazy!  What the hell is this, herbal tea? I hate herbal tea!  What are you two girls whispering about over there?!  I know! But if I didn’t work there, what else would I do?  Yeah that was lucrative! Smart like your brother!  Hmm, pulling in a salary in the high six figures or rubbing gross naked people for chump change—ooh, what do I do?! What will I do?!  I thought I’d try to take a walk. Would you pour me some water? I’ll be back soon.  No. I’ve learned my lesson.  Surprise! Look who’s back!  Hey!  Uh, I don’t think so!  Jack!! Hey!  All better! Back to work! Except this clown from research told me I was fired. He should do his research, huh?  Nu-uh!  Oh, okay I didn’t get that message. So this doesn’t count—Anyway, I’ll be in my office.  You’re in my office! Look, I have made a lot of cash for this company! Okay? I am talking big bucks! Pesos! Yen! Rubles! You make one little mistake…  Oh, so this is all about money! Y’know it’s bad enough that—Ow! Oh, you have got to be kidding!  I’m having another heart attack!  I’m having another heart attack!! Call 9-1-1!!  Well, they fired me and I’m having heart attack.  Yeah.  It’s me. It’s Phoebe. Listen there’s something in here I want to eat, what-what smells so good?  Yes. Yes. Yes. I can’t believe it! The baby wants bologna! Maybe he wants me to eat meat? I can’t eat meat!  Being pregnant is tough on your tummy.  That’s sweat. You throw up all morning, you’ll have that glow too.  Ooh, yeah. Then what are you going to put on top of that?  Ooh yeah! Then umm, what goes on top of the salami?  Oooh, yeah. You’re a genius.  Oh my God!! The baby just kicked!  Y’know it doesn’t matter how much I’m craving it. Y’know why I’m never gonna eat meat? Because it’s murder, cold blooded murder.  I can’t help it. I need the meat. The baby needs the meat.  Yeah, totally!  Yeah, but at what cost? Six more months, three meals a day, I’m gonna eat like, y’know millions of cows.  What?  Yeah.  Joey, I can’t believe you would do that for me.  Pastrami.  Hm-mm, corn beef.  Okay.  Six months.  Not if I get there first.  So what do you guys want for an engagement present?  Not unless someone borrowed it and left it at the gynecologist.  You mean the chocolate chip cookie recipe?  You mean the one that my grandmother made me swear on her deathbed that I would never let out of our family?  Break my heart—Oh, all right.  If you don’t sail your boat, what do you do on it?  Your own boat?  I just went to my old apartment to get you the-the cookie recipe and the stupid fire burned it up!  See no-no, I made a batch and I froze it, and this is the only one left.  Why not?  Really?!  You do?  That and arrogance.  Come on, it’s not that big a deal!  Oh, what was that for? Like a bake sale?  Yeah, but not as good as batch 17.  Are there anymore from the good batch? ‘Cause we could just work off of those.  Y’know, I bet it would actually make my grandmother very happy to know that we’re trying to figure out her recipe. I bet she’s l-l-lookin’ up at us and smiling right now.  Oh yeah—No, she was really nice to me, but she’s in hell for sure.  Oh no-no, no, I made a promise to myself that the next time I would talk to Ursula would be over my dead body. And that’s not happening ‘til October 15th, 2032.  That’s what you think.  Well, y’know I may have relatives in France who would know. My grandmother said she got the recipe from her grandmother, Nesele Tolouse.  Nesele Toulouse.  Oh, you Americans always butcher the French language.  Well, it was really sweet, and like the most romantic thing ever.  It\\'s, yes, my little black book. It\\'s got the numbers of all the guys I\\'ve dated.  I would, but you\\'re the last one.  Oh, my first love!  Well, I told you I had to spend all the day clearing out stuff, so Mike could move in.  Yeah.  Oh, it\\'s so hard to get rid of stuff! Did you and Chandler have to make compromises when you first moved in together?  A bunch of stuff. And the worst one... he wants me to get rid of Gladys.  Yeah. I really hate to give her up. Oh, I know!! Oh, you should take her!  Why, you don\\'t like her?  Really? You think?  Ok, I\\'ll fight for her. Ok! Oh, wait, oh I just realized... if I do that, that means you don\\'t get her.  Hi! Sorry, I\\'m late.  No, he really hates it. But he\\'s gonna let me keep my box of human hair! So you got to pick your battles. But the good news is, Gladys is yours!  Oh, she\\'s that work of art I made, you know, with the woman coming out of the frame.  Oh, I didn\\'t know you wanted her too!  Really? It doesn\\'t have anything coming out of it. Or maybe there is some place for her in your bedroom?  I knew it!  I don’t know. I don’t know. I can’t lie to him again. Oh no I—no! I’m just gonna press my breasts up against him.  Uh-huh, yeah that’s right.  What? You mean behind my back?  Oh hey!  Come on you know what to do! You hire the first one! You don’t hire an assistant because they’re cute, you hire them because they’re qualified.  Hey—Ooh, how’s Hilda? Is she working out?  Sorry.  What happened?  You! An actor?! That’s madness!  Hi!  You must be Hilda.  Oh, you like that? You should hear my phone number.  So you hired yourself a little treat did ya?  But-but you know you cannot get involved with your assistant.  Oh! Joey uh, were you in our room last night?  Hey!  Are you gonna open the presents without Chandler?  A little mirror that when you look into it you see yourself as an old woman.  Ohhh! My God! For tiny salt!  Oh yeah.  Okay.  Ooh, is it someone in this building? Is it that tall guy from the first floor?  What?! I think he’s cute.  Believe me I’m trying.  Yeah. You’re just gonna knock on his door and change his life forever. You’re like Ed McMahon except without the big check, or the raw sexual magnetism.  Pretty big? It’s huge! God, this guy doesn’t have a clue! He’s just walking down the street thinking, ‘I had sex with Rachel Green. I rock!’ then bam! He’s a father and everything’s different.  Okay. Then he still has this huge decision to make. Now he’s walking around thinking, ‘Do I want to be a dad?’ and then bam!  I don’t. He got…he-he-he-he’s hit by a bus.  Oh yeah. That’s me.  David Lynn.  Oh some guy from my gym. A little annoying.  Hey! Ooh, did you do it yet?  Thank God, ‘cause that hair on a baby…  Why not?  Bus?  Well-well but it is huge.  Hey lady, your day’s over! It’s my turn!  Hey!  We don’t know.  Who? Who is it?  Was that story over?  Look, I feel really bad about how I freaked you out before, so I called the father and asked him to meet you here so you can tell him. Go!  Uh-huh. Now you can turn around or you can go in there and rip the Band-Aid off. What to you want to do?  Really? Are you sure?  Rachel has something that she wants to tell you and umm, I believe that this is your red sweater.  What?!!  No!!  I can’t say that didn’t hurt. But I’ll take you back Joey Tribbiani.  Ooh! A Salami Buddy!  Wait you stole those from these people’s wedding?  Where were you?  Oh, which museum?  Umm, that paper’s two weeks old.  What’s wrong Mon?  Oh.  Hey, maybe they meant to write, ‘Quiet, bitch.’  Hey! You guys, I’m writing a holiday song for everyone. Do you want to hear it?  Oh, yay!  I know but it’s so hard! Nothing rhymes with your stupid name!  Pumpkin? Yeah. But did he ever call you like, Budolph?  No! No, the robots just work for them.  If she’s no fun, why do you want to date her at all?  Hey! Ooh, how was your first day working at the restaurant?  What?  So, did you pick one yet?  Well look, you don’t really like the one from uptown and you’re too exhausted from dating the one up in Poughkeepsie, so I say you just end them both. Okay? You take a train up to Poughkeepsie and break up with her, and on your way back you break up with uptown. And then by the time you get home tonight, you’re done!  Umm, well I had a similar problem when I lived in Prague.  There’s sooo much you don’t know.  Thank you! I know, though.  Ohh, well, you\\'re my lucky penny.  All right all ready.  We could not, would not want to wait.  I don\\'t know, you might be the first one.  Ah! Oh my God! You r-r-rotten boys!  What am I gonna do?  Monica, Monica, you know what gets out hummus.  Okay, thanks. Yeah, I\\'ll try that.  Hummus. I got the hummus.  That won\\'t go with this dress though.  Well, how could it not be breezy, no, \\'cause, you\\'re, you\\'re in such a breezy place.  Monica, you don\\'t know that.  Well, of course not for tonight. Yeah, hi!  Rachel, didn\\'t have anything that I liked, so, but she had this Christmas ribbon, and I thought, \\'All right, fine I\\'ll be political.\\'  Duh!! Christmas!  Okay, okay, okay, the black. But, oh, do you have black, with the little strappys?  Definitely.  Okay, we\\'re on it. We\\'re on it.  Oh, wait, let me get you another glass. That\\'s been sitting out.  Ross, went to get a cab so we can all... No, wh-what are you doing! No, Monica, no!  How did you do that?  Yeah, after this, I think he\\'ll be doing that himself.  So is Joey going to have to give up the apartment?  Well, how much do you think he needs?  Why don’t you hire him as an actor? You could have him dress up and put on little skits. Whatever you want.  And also, my birthday.  What a mean thing to say! I would never tell you it’s not your birthday!  Hey! So you guys have anything planned for the big last night?  My God, I can’t get a minute of peace around this place.  Oh my God! Monica’s just gonna kill you.  Well, what you’re wearing is fine for that.  I have plans.  That’s right.  Okay.  Well, this doesn’t have to be so sad though. Y’know? Maybe instead of just thinking about how much you’re gonna miss each other, you should like think of the things you’re not gonna miss.  Come on, there’s gotta be something.  Good! Great! You can go first.  Good that’s a good one. Okay, Monica, anything? Y’know? Does Rachel move the phone pen?  Okay, good. There you go. Doesn’t anyone feel better?  Great! It worked! No one’s sad.  Yeah, I think it was better when you guys were sad. Hey, uh, remember the roller blades?  Hey! I call her!  Well, one of you has to take the first step! And it should be you, because she’s the one who’s leaving. It’s harder for her!  I know, I took it hard too.  Hey, how are you guys doing?  Well, deep-deep-deep down!  Hey you guys, I don’t mean to make things worse, but umm, I don’t want to live with Rachel anymore.  You’re just so mean to each other! And I don’t want to end up like that with Rachel. I still like you!  What else?  That’s nice. I like having things to read in the bathroom.  Okay Rachel, I can’t wait to live with you! And you know what we should do? Bring Monica and then we could all live there together! We’ll have so much fun!!  Oh that’s right. You’re still set on that?  Yeah!  If she says no, can I have the ring?  If!  It’s gone.  Open bar?  I can do that for the kids.  Y’know, you are 12 years older than her.  Here.  So now what’s going on here?  No, I know what a silent is I meant, what’s going on with your hair?  No! It’s nice!  Hey you guys! Look!  I got me some drinks!  Open bar!  You just can’t stand anyone else enjoying themselves can’t you?  Forget her! You enjoy this!! (Pulls him back up and starts applauding again. Joey waves and does a salute.]  I’m just helping the kids!  Because the more I drink, the less there is for the kids to drink.  Oh, okay.  I wanna see what’s in your hand. I wanna see the trash.  Eww! Oh, it’s all dirty. You should throw this out.  What happened?  Well, a palm reader, a manicurist, a hand doctor…  Good one! Yeah.  Look, she only suspects something okay? She doesn’t know for sure, so just throw her off the track.  Yeah! Yeah! Convince her that-that you’re scared of commitment! Convince her that you’re a little coward!  No, you’re too late!!! She already took out the trash!!!  I know, they’re gonna be so happy together.  Not that often!  Me too! So happy for them!  Oh no! No God, definitely not jealous!  Totally. I’m like 90/10.  Definitely!  What do you mean?  You mean a backup?  Yeah, yeah I got that.  Hm-mmm.  Joey.  Yeah!  Yeah, I locked him years ago!  Yep, we shook on it. Yeah but believe me that is not how he wanted to seal the deal.  Well hey, it’s just a backup.  Of course I can! It’s just good sense to backup your backup! Look, I’ve already lost Chandler!  I don’t—Look I don’t know what you’re complaining about now? You were both aware of the situation!  Okay, this kind of back talk is not gonna fly when we’re married!  All right well let’s see, Ross is a good father, but Joey has a boat—This is hard!  No wait! Just—Okay—Just wait! You guys! Wait you guys! Don’t make any rash decisions, okay? Just remember my promise, when we get married, three times a week.  Good!  Oh no wait no, this is wrong! Ross isn’t here!  Oh, honey, honey, tell them the story about your patient who thinks things are, like, other things. Y\\'know? Like, the phone rings and she takes a shower.  Oops!  Thanks. Okay, now go away so we can talk about you.  Isn\\'t he great?  I know, I know. So sweet... and so complicated. And for a shrink, he\\'s not too shrinky, y\\'know?  Oh, I don\\'t know, I don\\'t know. I think that\\'s a little weird, y\\'know? Vinyl.  Yeah, \\'cause hello, these are not her boobies, these are her breasts.  Oh, this is my friend Roger.  Isn\\'t he good?  Oh, okay. Feel better, Rachel, \\'kay?  Oh, okay. Listen, thanks for everything, Mon.  Hey.  Good. Oh oh! Roger\\'s having a dinner thing and he wanted me to invite you guys.  So what\\'s going on?  Uh-huh. Okay. Okay, don\\'t you think, maybe, though, it\\'s just that he\\'s so perceptive that it freaks you out?  Nothing, nothing.  It\\'s, I mean, it\\'s nothing, I\\'m fine. It\\'s my friends. They-they have a liking problem with you. In that, um, they don\\'t.  But they don\\'t see all the wonderfulness that I see. They don\\'t see all the good stuff and all the sweet stuff. They just think you\\'re a little...  Intense and creepy.  But I don\\'t. Me, Phoebe.  You\\'re not? See, that\\'s why you\\'re so great!  Oh, okay, except I broke up with Roger.  Yeah, right.  I don\\'t know, I mean, he\\'s a good person, and he can be really sweet, and in some ways I think he is so right for me, it\\'s just... I hate that guy!  Hey, Joey. What\\'s going on?  Hey!  Oh, you won\\'t believe who moved back to town.  Oh, I know! \"Oh...I slept with Billy Joel\". All right, who hasn\\'t?  Ugh, Let\\'s just cut her out!  Cut her out of our lives! Just ignore her calls and dodge her \\'till she gets the point!  Oh, yeah. Could be Rachel asking if someone could baby-sit again.  Oh, you’re right! I was just kidding about Rachel. Babysitting is a gas!  Ok, don’t hold thy breath!  Why, why, why didn’t you just say no!  I did!  Hey!  No.  Oh! Well, what kind of emergency that gets us both out of here?  Hi!  Musty!  Well...kinda.  Yeah well, in America you\\'re just an \"ass\".  Oh Chandler! Thank God you\\'re alive. Monica, can I talk to you outside for a minute?  Please, Monica? In the hall?  It was right after we were living together and you were driving me crazy, okay? You were really controlling and compulsive and shrill.  You\\'re also so generous and kind and scrappy!  Exactly! Look, no matter what I tried to do, I couldn\\'t keep you out of my life. Of all the people I have cut out, you were the only one who ever clawed her way back in.  Yeah, you are. And I\\'m so glad that you fought your way back in, because I don\\'t know what I would do without you.  Yeah, I guess you\\'re right.  I hope it’s you.  Yes!!! Oh!!  Still.  Yeah, I’ll do that. So who gets to be yours?  Wh-why is that the best part?  Hey Rachel?  Umm, when I get married will you be my maid of honor?  Uh-hmm.  Oh! Well, if that’s what you want…  But why does it even matter?!  Because this one is now! And-and it’s two of our best friends! Who knows what you’re gonna marry!  Oh I know.  See? This is exactly why you shouldn’t lie!  Na-uh, I am!  Because I cared enough to lie!  What are you talking about?  Okay, so after this audition, who decides who gets it?  No! Coins hate me!  Ugh, what a kiss ass.  Yes! Your honor?  Oh!  Hey! Do you want do you want a little taste of Pheebs?!  Really?! I won!  The coins have finally forgiven me!  Hi!  Oh yeah!  Oh that’s so sweet thanks.  Ohh.  This stuff is great!  Y’know Rach, I think that, I think you should be Monica’s made of honor.  Because I think it means more to you.  Well, we just decided that Rachel is gonna be your maid of honor.  Oh, oh, but y\\'know, you always see these really beautiful women with these really nothing guys, you could be one of those guys.  Based on this play? ...Based on this play!  Oh, yeah. That is not true. Ross, is this your fantasy?  Ree! Ree! Ree! Ree! Ree!  Seriously, what-what\\'s the part?  No, I don\\'t think this was your shot. I mean, I don\\'t even think you just get one shot. I really believe big things are gonna happen for you, I do! You\\'ve gotta just keep thinking about the day that some kid is gonna run up to his friends and go \\'I got the part! I got the part! I\\'m gonna be Joey Tribbiani\\'s ass!\\'.  Yeah? Why?  Ohh, he left his cell phone.  Or we could use it to call China. See how those guys are doing.  I don\\'t know. I haven\\'t been out on a date in so long.  No way! No way! You just broke with Tag a week ago.  Nice try.  I don’t know.  Ah-ha! Too cocky!  Or, we can decide by whose ever name is closer to the word phone.  Ohh, I lost my mom to suicide.  Did I use that already today? I’m sorry.  Okay, a meat eater. Fine, that’s one for you.  So you don’t know that’s Barney’s the store! That can be y’know his friend’s house, or a bar. Who has Barney’s the store on their speed dial?  Hi!  Good.  Yeah.  Yeah!  Ooh, now you lost me.  No I didn’t!  No.  That is a different phone.  That is damning evidence.  Oh? And how will you know what time to come over?  Oh. Okay, well I-I was kinda hoping that I would just…be alone y’know to think about my mom and her suicide.  What?! That’s the first time today!  Whoa! Why do you get to answer the door?  Because it’s my apartment!  Could you-could you umm, give us one second?  Wh-what do we do?  Hmm, they just don’t make ‘em like that anymore!  Rachel, listen—I mean, if you let me have him then I will really owe you one.  Yeah! You’re such a great friend!  Eeee!!! Eee!! Eee!!  Hey!  Oh, he has a gig. I kinda like being married to a rock star, you know. My husband has a gig.  Oh, he\\'s playing organ for a children\\'s roller-skating party.  Uh-hmm.  Yes! You know, in six months the Statute of Limitations runs out and I can travel internationally again!  I know.  It\\'s a cotton swab with a bit of my saliva on it, so that if they perfect the cloning process while you are over there, you can use the DNA to create your own Pheebs!  Ok.  She\\'s gonna say goodbye to each of us individually.  Yeah, I know, it\\'s gonna be even worse for you... God... Ross, get ready to do some serious crying.  These are not mine... Look how flimsy they are, come on! Good God! You try to hang a guy from a waterpipe with these, they\\'ll snap like a piece of licorice.  I don\\'t know. But, God, Joey seems to be handling it suprisingly well.  You know, maybe she was just really spent from our talk. It was pretty intense.  Ross, if you\\'re this upset, you should go and talk to her.  Tell me about it.  All right, I think I\\'m gonna head out.  I thought I was going home to go to bed, but I\\'m sensing there\\'s something less fun for me to do here.  How was your night?  Yeah, you got to get to the hospital.  All right, ready?  All right, here it goes...  Hey guys!  Hey, have you seen Frank Jr., \\'cause he\\'s meeting me here with the triplets.  Hey, what\\'s all this stuff?  Ooh, babies! Oh, this one is so cute, get this one!  Oh, how does it work?  Well, if you\\'re having a hard time, you should talk to my friends, Bill and Colleen. They adopted a kid. I\\'m sure they\\'d help you.  Hey!  Good to see you.  Oh, god. So adorable. Look at them sleeping there like angels.  Well, they may be a handful, but they\\'re so cute.  Oh, god, the last time I babysat them, they did the funniest thing..  That\\'s a, that\\'s a long time.  Yeah, I know, Frank. I counted them when they were coming out of my area.  What?  Oh my god, Frank, are you thinking of leaving? Because I didn\\'t have those triplets so you could just run out on them!  What?! You can\\'t separate them! That\\'s terrible. Which one?  Okay, well, this is crazy. Can\\'t seriously be talking about me taking one of your kids, can we?  Insane.  Alice would never go for it, right?  Well, just you know, for argument\\'s sake, you know, hypothetically. Which one would you be willing to give up?  Frank Jr.Jr.?  Uh-huh.  Well, alright, that\\'s fine. What about Leslie?  Alright, so that leaves Chandler.  Wow, Frank. I think we just ran out of kids.  I\\'m sorry, Frank. I didn\\'t realise things were so bad. You know, I\\'ll help out more. I can - I can babysit any time you want. You name the day, and I\\'ll be there.  Well, that\\'s not good. But you know, I can move some stuff around, and I\\'ll be there. You and Alice just take the whole day together.  Are you kidding? That\\'s what sisters are for.  Hey.  Still, he had to find out sometime.  No! Joey, you’re going to be great!  No, I’m just deciding which one to use—I’m gonna start writing another book!  Well, if you must know I have written 14 books. And as I am the only one who has read them, I can tell you that they all have been very well received.  Oh, Rachel and I have appointments to get our hair cut.  I want to see what he wants first.  You’re Elizabeth’s father, huh? I can see now where she gets her rugged handsomeness.  Yeah, it’s about relationships. Y’know? The traps, the pitfalls, what not to do, keep going. This stuff is great!  Hey!  Well, why don’t you just get him fired?  I’m not writing about you! I’m writing about other people.  Marcia and Chester.  I see what you’re doing!  Ooh, I have tasted my own medicine and it is bitter!  I know what time you said.  Well actually, I know what time Chester and Marcia said.  I will tell you as soon as you thank me for writing my book.  Thanks! So are you.  That’s right.  Hey!  Hey, you know what might help you deal with it? Think of it this way, you and Emily are in the past and you can\\'t be mad about the past. So are you still mad about the Louisiana Purchase?  Exactly! Because it\\'s in the past!  Okay, then what happened?  What?!  Hey!  What were you doing?  You two will have very hairy children.  So are you actually gonna see her again?  Uh-hmm.  Get your foot off my contestant! Judge!  Ohhh.  Hey!  Are you serious?!  You don\\'t need Janice for that, you\\'ve got us. We…  Ohh, tough call.  Hi!  Come on in!  So how was the honeymoon?  You have got to be kidding me!  Monica! That’s not right! Start with where.  I can’t believe he taped the two of them having sex!  You got fake numbered.  Excuse me, I don’t want Greg and Jenny’s rejects.  Hmm, I wonder why. Pervert!  That’s like the pervert motto! Yeah! Yeah! They have you raise your right hand, put your left hand down your pants, and repeat that!  No! Not the sex part, just the stuff leading up to it.  Okay fine! Fine! We’ll just have to think of some other way to put the whole ‘Who came onto who,’ thing to rest! Come on now, think!!  You’re gonna get pregnant.  Oh, you came on to Ross!  Ok, so this is pretty much what\\'s happened so far. Ross was in love with Rachel since, you know, forever, but every time he tried to tell her, something kind of got in the way, like cats, and Italian guys. Finally Chandler was like \"forget about her\" but when Ross was in China on his dig, Chandler let it slip that Ross was in love with Rachel. She was like, \"Oh my god.\" So she went to the airport to meet him when he came back, but what she didn\\'t know was, that Ross was getting off the plane with another woman. Uh-Oh! So, that\\'s pretty much everything you need to know. But, enough about us. So, how\\'ve you been?  Oh my god. This is huge. This is bigger than huge. This is like, all right, what\\'s bigger than huge?  Yes.  Oh, ok. How, it\\'s been so long since you\\'ve had sex, you\\'re wondering if they\\'ve changed it?  All right, so what were you thinking?  Ohh! No.  Because, I\\'m just, I\\'m incredibly anal and an unbelievable control freak.  I know I\\'m not, but you are, and I was trying to spare your feelings.  I\\'m still on \"no.\"  What\\'s goin\\' on?  Where?  All right. Ok, but, but!  You have to promise that you will not be all like control-y and bossy and Monica about it.  All right, that\\'s it, I quit.  Would you relax? I know what I am doing. This is how he wears it.  Demi Moore.  Well, he was a he in Arthur, and in Ten.  Oh.  Oh!  Oh my God!  Oh my God! I\\'m sorry, I\\'m sorry. Which one\\'s Demi Moore?  Oh, she\\'s got gorgeous hair.  It\\'s too soon to tell. She\\'s resting, which is a good sign.  I\\'m not gonna lie to you, Ross, it doesn\\'t look good. I put a clip on one side, which seems to have stopped the curling.  Your hair looks too good, I think it would upset her. Ross, why don\\'t you come on in.  Oh yeah!  Oh, I can do that.  You wanna do it right now?  Oh, yeah. Ok, thank you.  I think David would probably wanna hear a few lectures.  No, no, because, you know, he\\'s been in Minsk for 8 years and if he gets too much direct sunlight, he\\'ll die.  Oh, I should go, too. Oh, now... tomorrow do you guys wanna share a cab to the airport or should Mike and I just meet you there.  Mike?? Who\\'s Mike?  That\\'s right! Oh, yeah... Well, I\\'ve totally forgotten about im! AH! That\\'s-That\\'s... a blast from the past!  Really, it doesn\\'t mean anything. I mean, you know, Monica refers to Chandler as Richard all the time!  I\\'m sooo sorry!! I just... I keep thinking about Mike! I\\'m crazy about David, and we\\'re having so much fun together. Why-Why do I miss Mike? That\\'s-that\\'s gonna go away, right?  Yeah.  You just did it again. Chandler, your feelings for Chandler are certainly gone!  Not Joey.  Yeah?  Wow? Really? That\\'s fantastic!  Sure! Look, ok, bottom line: I love Mike... David! David. I love David. Don\\'t look at me that way, Roseanne Rosannadanna!  Sure, ok, yeah.  Oh my God, Mike!  No, Mike\\'s here.  What are you, what are you doing here?  I love you. But I never needed a proposal from you. I just needed to know that we were headed somewhere, you know, that we had a future.  David, I\\'m so sorry, I\\'m sorry.  Yeah, I might have said yes, but that would have been wrong.  ... and...?  All right, all right... I\\'ll play if we don\\'t keep score!  Nobody wins!  Yeah, I\\'m out.  Mike, you don\\'t know, you don\\'t know what you\\'re doing!  No idea! I though he was soft like you!  Tails!  C\\'mon Mike, you can beat her! Knock that dog off her head!  Mike wins?  You can\\'t do that!  Ok, we\\'re taking that paddle home, mister.  It\\'s like watching porn!  We were out of Doritos.  Wow! I cannot believe Mark asked you out.  What, so what are you gonna tell him?  Huh.  Wow. So, okay, maybe that means that, you’re not over Ross yet and you have issues with your father.  Okay, so it’s probably just the Ross thing then.  Y\\'know what, you should like, you should buy a state and then just name it after yourself.  Yeah, or, or, or, Mississ-Pete.  Yeah, kinda.  It isn’t?  Oh, okay. There should be Gold Man!  Okay well, he would turn things to gold.  Ahh, his work is done.  Hey!  I know! I know, and I’ve only been playing for like an hour!  Hey! What are you doing here?  Oh, well, don’t tell me you want to keep more of your stuff in my uterus.  Wow! That’s so great! Oh! Oh! Cougar.  Hi!  No, I’m-I’m not sure about Hulk, but I like the idea of a name starting with \"The.\"  God, Susan is so fun!  Yeah, I definitely. I don’t like the name Ross.  No! No! I-I meant for the baby!  Well, it’s just y’know that something like this would never to like The Hulk, y’know…  So, I decided I’m definitely going to go with either Joey or Chandler.  Well, how about a compromise then, okay? What if it’s like y’know, Chanoey?  All right, so, what are we supposed to call you?  Umm, Gene.  Bye, Gene.  Oh my God!  Wow, Carol really messed you up!  All right, all right, so up until ‘92-93 he was very trusting, then ’94 hit, Carol left him and bamn! Paranoid city!  Yeah. The ’92 Ross wouldn’t.  Drum roll.  You’re actually going through with this?  Yeah, but you have to keep the name too!  Okay!  Yeah!  Yay!  Yay—oh—yay! Okay, I gotta go tell Frank and Alice! Right now!  Okay, bye!  Hey what are you guys looking at?  Yeah, come to papa.  Oo! Is it for my birthday present?  Yeah, but remember you said you ordered something special, and it just hasn\\'t come yet?  \\'Kay.  Yeah, and what a great way to say, \"I secretly love you, roommate\\'s girlfriend!\"  It\\'s gotta be better than that book. Oo! Like a crossbow!  There you go, that\\'s the spirit! Okay! Now, if you need money, I will lend you money, but just get moving!  Okay! It\\'s worth it, if it will get you moving. You haven\\'t worked in months.  Yes, but I\\'m doing this.  Ooo, a crossword! Can I help?  Fine. But you can\\'t help me develop my new universal language.  Mon! I\\'m so happy for you!  I\\'ll have one, please. Plus my money.  Oh. Okay. Oo, sorry I acted like a bank.  Yes. Did you settle the bill?  Oh, all right. Oh! Look what we almost took!  But Mon, you have to get our money!  I know, it\\'s tough. You know what the first thing I did after my mother\\'s funeral was?  Pay the caterer! Look, I\\'ve had a lot of jobs, okay, and there are some people who just always try to get out of paying. It\\'s either, you know, \"that massage wasn\\'t long enough, or, \"I don\\'t recognize any of those songs,\" or, you know, \"these sombreros aren\\'t big enough. Bad little white girl!\"  Well, it seems like there weren\\'t any tears \\'til you showed her the bill.  She seems fine now.  You didn\\'t get the money, did you?  Okay, Widow!  Uh... yay!  Yeah. I\\'m a hard ass.  Yeah. Hard Ass and Wuss. We could fight crime!  Okay!  Yeah. Oh! It\\'ll be like I have a wife in the fifties!  Hey Rach, wanna hear the new song I\\'m thinkin\\' of singing this afternoon? I wrote it this morning in the shower.  But, but this is my gig. This is where I play. My, my name is written out there in chalk. You know, you can\\'t just erase chalk.  And he\\'s going to be paying this woman? Why doesn\\'t he just give her like a throne, and a crown, and like a, you know, gold stick with a ball on top.  Yeah, ok. You probably did everything you could.  Really?  Oh! Oh my god. This is so exciting. How much am I gonna get?  Well you said that he\\'s paying the people who are playing.  Well, I\\'m not gonna be the only one who\\'s not getting paid.  Right. My name was on there, but now it just says \"carrot cake\". So, um, so um, how many chords do you know?  Oh yeah, so you know D?  Ok, do you know A minor?  Ok, do you know how to go from D to A minor?  Ok. Um, so does your guitar have a strap?  Oh, hi.  Thank you.  Eight dollars and 27 cents. But not really, \\'cause I put in the first two, just to, you know, get the ball rolling, and to make myself feel better.  No. This whole like playing-for-money thing is so not good for me. You know, I don\\'t know, when I sang \"Su-Su-Suicide\", I got a dollar seventy-five. But then, \"Smelly Cat\", I got 25 cents and a condom. So you know, now I just feel really bad for Smelly Cat.  It\\'s not even that. I used to do my songs because it made me happy, but now it\\'s like, it\\'s just all about the money.  Really? From who?  Yeah. Here you go.  No, no, no. I\\'m sorry. It\\'s \"smelly cat, smel-ly cat\".  Better. Yeah.  Yeah, much better. And you know what, don\\'t feel bad, because it\\'s a hard song.  You wanna try it again?  Ok, there is no top. That\\'s the beauty of Smelly Cat. Um, why don\\'t you just follow me?  Mmmm hmmm.  That\\'s too much. Sorry.  Okay!  And call me!  We want you to marry her!  She is so amazing! You have no idea.  Joey, she’s so cool. She speaks four languages.  Yeah, but you always say that.  Whatever.  Secret affair!  Oh no.  Hey!  Yay!! Oh so, you’re not, you’re not mad at us anymore?  Didn’t you sleep together?  Then change it back!  No spark? Didn’t you sleep together?  Does Joey have any idea?  Yeah, you mean like that you’re kind of a loner.  Oh well, I guess Italian isn’t one of the four languages you speak.  No, just a regular old flying dwarf.  Hey!  So how was, how was your date?  Oh really? She said she wants to go away with you?  Hey Joey, y’know what? You are way to good for her.  Who’s singing?  Ewww! Oh! It’s the Mattress King!  Hey!  Ugh! I don’t know Monica. It feels funny just being here. I mean if you buy a bed from Janice’s ex-husband, that’s like betraying Chandler.  Hey! Ooh! How was teaching last night?  Ooooh, nice.  Oh, yay!  Okay.  Yeah, so please, please, please, don’t say anything to Chandler.  Is that a problem?  Yeah, well I had to learn, I was staying at the Y and some off the young men weren’t acting Christian enough.  Oh! Oh! Oh!  Wow! And I’m a vegetarian! All right, all right, well I’m sorry, we’ll put some ice on it.  ‘Kay, put your head back.  All right, I have ya. Oh God.  Oh, it’s the compulsively neat one by the window, okay.  I’m, I’m freaking out! Monica kinda trusted me with something and she shouldn’t have! All right, I haven’t lived here in a while, so I have to ask you something. Does Monica still turn on the lights in her bedroom?  Isn’t it cool! Varoom! Varoom!  I know, you must’ve won like a contest or something!  I’m sorry, okay, I-I wasn’t looking, and the store says that they won’t take it back because you signed for it...  When I was you! Y\\'know what, it’s all Joey’s fault, ‘cause he left his nose open!  It’s Monica’s bed. What?  So. This has always been Monica’s bed, what you’re just noticing now, how self-involved are you?  Well, if you really, really want it, then it’s okay.  I can’t say.  I can’t say because he’s famous.  Okay, okay. It’s James Brolin. James Brolin is the father of my baby.  What?! Well he never said that to me!  How about just the bridemaids?  It is.  Oh my God!  So instead you told me Monica was pregnant.  Sneaky.  Uh-hmm.  Oh, I know. I could only think of two names, him and Ed Begley Jr. and then I remembered he’s gay.  So, are you ready to talk about it?  Now?  Okay, we’ll talk about something else then.  Who’s the father?!  Yeah. That’s fine. That’s fair. Is it Tag?  Okay, I’m sorry. I’ll stop.  Is it Ross? It’s Ross isn’t it—Oh my God, it’s Joey!  Ah-hah! At least we know it’s a him.  Well, I just got off the phone with my lover, James Brolin…  Yes, and apparently he is married to some singer, but he said he would leave her for me. And I said, \"James, James Brolin, are you sure?\" James Brolin said…  Calm down. Maybe you’re not pregnant.  When I got pregnant with the triplets, I took that test like three times just to make sure.  I’m-I’m just saying, don’t freak out until you’re a hundred percent sure.  I’ll run out and get you one.  Oh no, she won’t tell us.  See? This is why you register.  30 seconds.  It’s time.  Okay.  Umm, it’s negative.  It’s negative.  No, it’s positive.  It’s-it’s not negative, it’s positive.  Well yeah, I lied before.  Now you know how you really feel about it.  With who?  Oh, it’s so great to see you feeling like this!  Wait, am I missing something though? ‘Cause I thought death was something that’s supposed to be sad, in a way.  Wow, a house for dolls, that is so cool! When I was kid, I had a barrel.  No, just a barrel.  Really?! Really?!  Oh! Ooh! Oh Monica! It’s so beautiful.  So, I’m here, ready to play.  That’s a dog, every house should have a dog.  Well, maybe it’s so big because the house was built on radioactive waste.  No, no, that’s the ghost for the attic.  Well, nobody wants a ghost. But you’ve got one, because the house is sitting on an ancient Indian burial ground.  Okay, obviously you don’t know much about the U.S. government.  The little ones do.  Hey!  Look everybody, look at my new dollhouse!!  The Licorice Room, you can eat all the furniture. And, when guests come over, they can stay on the tootsie roll-away bed.  All right. Did everyone get out okay?  Hey.  Oooh, so so so, did you read the book?  Didn\\'t it like totally speak to you?  Yeah and oh, and but there\\'s, there\\'s wind and the wind can make us Goddesses. But you know who takes out wind? Men, they just take it.  Ya-huh, all the time, cause they are the lightning bearers.  Yeah.  Oh yes, no, Richard would never steal your wind.  No, \\'cause he\\'s yummy.  Oh yes. Oh and, the part about how they\\'re always like drinking from out pool of inner power, but God forbid we should take a sip.  Ok, this is a typical lightning-bearer thing. Right there, it\\'s like, um, \\'Hello, who wants one of my fallic shaped man cakes?\\'  I don\\'t think it would have sold a million copies but it would have made a nice gift for you.  Um-um, um-um.  Ok, question number 28, have you ever allowed a lighning bearer to take your wind? I would have to say no.  What?  Yeah ok, well at least I didn\\'t let some guy into the forest of my righteous truth on the first date.  Paul.  Listen to you two. It\\'s so sad. Looks like I\\'m gonna be going to the goddess meetings alone.  I love you goddesses. I don\\'t ever want to suck your wind again.  Yeah.  Is anyone else starting to really like him?  Yeah, I think so, yeah.  I dunno, \\'cause you\\'re smart, you\\'re funny...  Yeah, you have homosexual hair.  Oh, that sucks!  Maybe that\\'s \\'cause she\\'s not really gone.  Thanks!  What\\'d I say?  God, what a great day. ...What? Weather-wise!  Okay, don\\'t worry, I\\'m just checking to see if the muscle\\'s in spasm...huh.  You missed a belt loop.  Okay, it\\'s in spasm.  Hey, look who\\'s up! How do you feel?  Ooh! That\\'s so nice...  Yeah, and these are my friends. People. This is Vince, Vince the people.  Vince is a fireman.  Oh, Jason? Yeah, uh-huh, we\\'re seeing each other tonight.  I know, I know! I\\'m like playing the field. Y\\'know? Like, juggling two guys, I\\'m sowing my wild oats. Y\\'know? Y\\'know, this kind\\'ve like y\\'know oat-sowin\\', field-playin\\' juggler.  Well, it just, it doesn\\'t feel like playing anymore, it feels like work. It\\'s like I\\'m working in the field.  Yeah, but Jason\\'s really sensitive.  Yeah.  Jason is not a sissy!  God, that is the nicest kitchen.  No! But it\\'s the nicest kitchen, the refrigerator told me to have a great day.  All right. I gotta go. I have break up with Vince.  Excuse me. Umm, is Vince here?  Wow! I didn’t know you guys actually used those.  Umm, wow. This-this isn’t gonna be easy. Umm, I don’t think we should see each other anymore.  I’m sorry.  Oh my God, I didn’t…  Hey Mon umm, if you do get married, can I bring two guests?  No, that was my way of telling you. Well, it turns out he’s incredibly sensitive, he keeps a journal and he paints. He even showed me charcoal drawings that he drew of me.  Yeah, well he’d prefer water colors, but y\\'know, he has easy access to a lot of charcoal.  Nah-ha!  Hey!  I don’t know, he just started kissing me. Get him! Get him, Vince!  Yeah, okay, I’ve-I’ve been dating both of you, and it’s been really horrible. ‘Cause y\\'know it’s been a lot of fun, for me. Umm, but I-I like you both, and I, and I didn’t know how to chose, so... I’m sorry, I’m just, I’m terrible, I’m a terrible person. I’m terrible.  Really?!  Well, I made you a candle light dinner in the park.  Yeah, but I-I-I-I can do that for you, I’m gonna do that for you.  I\\'m sorry... I\\'m sorry. It\\'s obviously way too early for us to be... having that conversation.  Oh, it\\'s a key. To be honest, I think I\\'d prefer the five dollars.  Oh no, I want to.  It really is.  Who cares, it got you here.  A-Allright, well... I\\'ll call the cab company.  Thank you! God, no! You should see me when... Oh actually, no, I look pretty good.  No...  I\\'m... I\\'m just... I\\'m the worst person ever. How can I not tell David that I\\'m seeing Mike?  He said: Are you seeing someone? And I said no...  Yeah! I mean, I don\\'t know. I was just , I was looking, I was looking in his eyes and I was just thinking: Oh my God! It\\'s David. David\\'s here. He\\'s just, he\\'s so irresistible.  Really? Chandler?  Oh.Okay, then it gets worse, \\'cause then I told him that I would see him tomorrow night.  I mean I guess, I just have to... tell David that nothing can happen between us. Unless I don\\'t... You know, complicated moral situation, no right, no wrong...  Okay, I knew I should have had this conversation with Joey.  Hey!  No, but it sounds like it was fricken funny...  Oof...  Oh, wait, wait!  Yeah, I should have told you.  I\\'m sorry, I\\'m sorry.  I am happy.  Well... but David, just... I just want you to know that... that... you know... telling you this... is one of the hardest things I\\'ve ever had to do.  Yeah?  Hmmm... No, no... No, I can\\'t do this. It\\'s bad.  No, no. No.  Look David, if... if you had never left, then... yeah, we\\'d probably still be together right now, but... you did leave, and I-I\\'m with Mike and I really care about him...  No, no, no, no, no... It\\'s not... it\\'s not... i\\'ts not as bad as it looks... really. I was just saying goodbye to an old friend.  No, uhm... David and I did use to go out... but years ago, and he lives in Minsk. He\\'s only... he\\'s only in town for a couple of days.  No, no...  Oh, well, yeah...  Okay, well... guys?  I\\'m sorry, I\\'m so sorry. If you... If you want your key back, I totally understand.  Ooh, look at you fancy lads. What\\'s the occasion?  Ahh.  Okey-doke.  Um, I\\'m getting a lily for my Mom. \\'Cause her name\\'s Lily.  Um, a chip. A tattoo, I\\'m getting a tattoo.  No, I think you should tell them.  OK Rach, which, which lily? This lily or that lily?  I like this lily. It\\'s more open, ya know, and that\\'s like my mom. She had a more open, giving spirit. Ooh, Foghorn Leghorn, ooh.  Here we go.  You\\'re not going?  What? Is it - is this \\'cause of what Ross said?  I don\\'t believe this. Is this how this relationship\\'s gonna work? Ross equals boss. I mean, c\\'mon what is this, 1922?  Just, you know, long time ago. Well, when men used to tell women what to do - a lot. And then there was suffrage, which is a good thing but is sounds horrible. Do you want to get this tattoo?  OK, hey, HEY. Is your boyfriend the boss of you?  OK, who is the boss of you?!!  No. You are the boss of you. Now you march your heinie in there and get that heart tattooed on your hip. GO!!  Oh that looks so good, oh I love it.  Ahh. OK, let\\'s see yours again.  No.  I\\'m sorry, I\\'m sorry.  I know, I know, and I was gonna get it but then he came in with this needle and uh, di-, did you know they do this with needles?  Wanna see mine, wanna see mine?  OK, that\\'s my tattoo.  OK, hi. For your information this is exactly what I wanted. This is a tattoo of the earth as seen from a great distance. It\\'s the way my mother sees me from heaven.  I know you\\'re just moving uptown but I\\'m really gonna miss you.  Hey you guys, guess what?  Yeah, yeah, I’m going to be out there spreading joy to the people. I mean, last year, I spread a little joy but not really enough. So this year, I’m going to do the whole city.  Hey!  Well, it\\'s going okay.  Oh, thanks!  Wow!  Is that a new Swede jacket? It looks really expensive.  Just get your nails done?  Thank you! And Happy Holidays.  Wait, you can\\'t take the money out.  But, can\\'t you leave the dollar? This money is for the poor.  Okay, Seasons Greetings and everything, but still…  Thank you, Happy Holidays.  Does it look like an ashtray?  Does it look like a urinal?  Well, yeah! But I\\'m not gonna take anymore crap. Okay? No more Mrs. Nice Bucket!  What?!  That chick can\\'t handle my corner.  Hey.  What you got?  Goodie! Thanks. So, how is it living with Rachel again? I mean, apart from the great food.  Oh my god, Rachel asked me if I knew anyone for her too.  I don\\'t know. They\\'re so perfect for each other; it\\'s crazy.  I just wish they\\'d realise they should be together.  I know. They should be a family. They should get married and have more children.  You know what? Maybe once they start dating, and they see what\\'s out there, they\\'ll realise how good they are for each other.  So, what are we gonna do? Are we just gonna go ahead and set them up with people?  Ooh, Joey.  Hey. I\\'m so excited; I just set up Rachel with the worst guy tonight.  Well, it\\'s this guy I used to massage. And by massage, I mean hold down so he wouldn\\'t turn over and flash me.  Oh, yeah.  A teacher?  Well, Ross does. What... You\\'re - you\\'re ruining the plan! Joey, you\\'ve - you\\'ve fixed him up with his perfect woman!  Yeah.  How do you even know a woman like that?  Joey.  So now what do we do?  What if we don\\'t find him somebody else? We\\'ll just tell her the date\\'s off, but we don\\'t tell Ross, and he goes to the restaurant and gets stood up!  Ooh, so this is great! Rachel\\'s gonna have a terrible date, Ross gets stood up, and then they\\'ll realise how good they have it together.  No, I think we killed it.  Hello?  Hey, Rach!  You know, you are talking about one of my dear, dear friends.  Oh, right, so he gets a little crazy when he\\'s stoned.  Did he go out for a cigarette?  My dear, sweet Rach.  Now, wait a minute. So, they\\'re gonna name their first child Joey?  How - how do I get them to name the next one after me?  Oh, so they owe me like, three Phoebes.  Oh my god! Look, it\\'s Ross and Rachel. Oh, the plan is working.  Don\\'t, don\\'t do the plan-laugh.  Oh, yeah, they\\'re falling in love all over again.  Oh, they see us! Oh, they, they look mad. Oh, they figured it out. They\\'re coming this way. Run!  Mexico!  What is it?  I know, I know, we can drive, we can vote, we can work, what more do these broads want?  Hi!  Ah, ah.  Yeah, I saw the article on your coffee table and I memorized the title to freak you out!  Joey\\'s having a party and he wasn\\'t gonna invite us?  And that horrible museum tour!  We know about your party Joey.  Hey!  Hey Ross!  Oh, What\\'s the matter?  Worse?  Hey Ross! So listen, about you and the dinosaur girl, are you really just gonna let a couple of Nobel prizes scare you off? What is that, come on, a piece of paper?  Go Charlie! But my point is, ok so she dated them but she also broke up with them. Maybe she\\'s looking to, you know, slum it with some average Joe Phd.  You\\'re so much more than just brains! You\\'re sweet, and kind, and funny...  Ok well give her a chance to see all of that!  Good for you! And hey, I thought your paper on punctuated equilibrium in the Devonian era was top notch!  Hey, thank you so much for these tickets, Chandler.  Oh, hey Joey.  Listen, I need to ask you something. Ok, you know how my step dad\\'s in prison.  Yeah. Well, uhm... listen he was supposed to get a weekend furlough, so he\\'d come to the wedding tomorrow, but he just called and... uhm... well, apparently stabbing Iceman in the exercise yard just couldn\\'t wait till Monday.  No, and so there\\'s no one to walk me down the aisle and... well, I would just really love it if you would do it.  Yeah, you\\'ve... you know, sort of been like a dad to me. I mean, you\\'ve always, you know, looked out for me and shared your wisdom...  So... what do you say?  Oh, thank you. I hope... I hope you know how much you mean to me.  Oh.  Well, I don\\'t care, so you pick!  Uh-uh. Ok. What time is that.  Why, I must have been in missile training the day they taught that.  Ok, so... 1800 minus twelve is... one thousand, seven hundred and...  Ok.  Ice sculpture? That sounds really fancy! I told you I just want a simple wedding.  What harpist? My friend Marjorie is playing the steel drums.  She did? Why?  Hey!  Okay, what did we say was your one gift to us?  Rehearse it!  So Rach.  Where is Emma?  What\\'s up?  Uhm... well, they\\'re not in the wedding.  I\\'m sorry you guys but, you know, Mike\\'s got his brother and his friends from school so... you know, you were-you were... if it helps you, you were next in line, you just-you just missed the cut.  Oh! I though the pot stickers were supposed to be vegetarian!  I don\\'t have a fax machine.  I decided to pee.  Oh no, no. I can\\'t choose between you two! I love you both so much!  Well, there\\'s a spot open for only one groomsman and you have to choose between Ross and Chandler. So good luck with that.  All right, I guess I\\'ll have to find a new bridesmaid.  Hey!  Oh, happy my wedding day to you!  Oh, well that\\'s ok. I think you and I will do much better if you\\'re just... here as a bridesmaid.  Wow, this is a lot!  You won awards?  Sven I don\\'t understand what you\\'re saying! What is wrong with the flowers? Lorkins? What the hell are lorkins?  Listen, Mike, if you were Swedish and you were saying the word \"lorkins\" what flowers would that be?  Right there! That\\'s why I\\'m marrying you!  Okay.  Oh my God, what\\'s it doing here?  Alright, wait, so what you\\'re saying is that the chef is at the Hamilton Club, but the food is not and the drinks are there, but the bartender is not? Are you, are you FREAKING KIDDING ME!?  I want you to be Crazy Bitch again.  More than I wanna get married.  I know.  What?  Uhuh, uhuh... Oh my God! This is really happening.  Oh, thank you.  I love you guys.  Oh wait, oh no. Wait.  I don\\'t care... I\\'ll be my something blue.  Thank you.  Na-ah.  Oh wait, oh I forgot... and uhm... I love you... and you have nice eyes.  I do.  Tell him, tell him.  Just for some short-term-work. You know, until I get back some of my massage clients.  No, nothing like that. I was just...such a dummie. I taught this \"massage-yourself-at-home-workshop.\" And they are.  What... I could, I could do it. What is it?  I could be a secretary.  I could do that.  Well, maybe 25-26.  There you go.  Ross says hi.  This is so fun. All right, what do we do now?  All right. Bye bye.  Whatcha doin\\'?  Oh, exellent. Everyone was so, so nice.  No, I didn\\'t tell anybody that I knew you.  Oh, because, you know... they don\\'t like you.  I thought you knew that.  Everyone. Except for uh... no everyone.  Don\\'t feel bad. You know they used to like you a lot. But then you got promoted, and, you know, now you\\'re like \"Mr. Boss Man\". You know, Mr. Bing. Mr. Bing, \"Boss Man Bing\".  Yeah, yeah. They even do you.  You know like... uh okay... uh... \\'Could that report be any later?\\'  Um, oh, I\\'ve got a birthday party, with some work people.  No, I know. That\\'s a part of the whole, you know, them-not-liking-you-extravaganza.  Well, then you should come tonight. You know, just hang out with them. Let them see what a great guy you still are.  I really do, yeah.  Okay.  Oh, but, could we not go together? I,I don\\'t wanna be the geek that invited the boss.  You were great. But they still made fun of you.  You know, now you\\'re more like, you know like, \"Mr. Caring Boss,\" \"Mr.\", you know, \"I\\'m one of you, Boss,\" \"Mr., I wanna be your buddy, Boss Man Bing!\"  Well, you know what Chandler? I think you\\'ve gotta face it. You\\'re like, the guy in the big office, you know. You\\'re the one that hires them, that fires them... They still say you\\'re a great boss.  Uh huh. But they\\'re not your friends anymore.  No, but you can\\'t.  Uh uh.  Petrie.  Hey!  No, but he’s always late.  Yeah, I did. I think it sounds y\\'know big sistery, y\\'know, ‘Frank’s always late.’  No, I know, I’m just nervous. Y\\'know it’s just y\\'know Mom’s dead, don’t talk to my sister, Grandma’s been sleeping a lot lately. It’s like the last desperate chance to have a family, y\\'know, kinda thing. You’re so sweet to wait with me.  This is everybody. This is Ross.  Chandler.  Joey.  This is Monica.  And this is Rachel.  I’m gonna get coffee.  Oh yeah! Yeah, no, we’re gonna connect, y\\'know bond, and everything.  Yeah I know what I wanted to ask you. Um, can you roll your tongue? Because I can, and my Mom couldn’t, and I thought y\\'know, I figured that was something I got from our Dad.  Oh right, yeah okay, my Mom could, and I can’t. We don’t have that....  Feburary 16th.  Wow, that’s close. When’s yours?  That’s the same month as Halloween. So, um, what kinda things do you like to do at home?  Okay so, by melting, you meant melting.  So is it like art?  Um, yeah sure. Why you wanna call your Mom?  Oh, well um, not right now. Y\\'know I’m just gonna go to bed, I think the fumes are giving me a headache.  G’night, bro.  No kind. He just makes it up.  So far, it kinda blows. I don’t know, I just thought y\\'know that he’d feel more like a brother y\\'know, like you and Ross, just like close and connected and....  Ah!!  Oh, how do you play the shadow game?  I just asked you.  I don’t have time for this.  Which you just gave up really quickly.  Build the unit Cinderelly, lay the tile Cinderelly.  Oh! I’m a masseuse. I give people massages and stuff.  Well, y\\'know we don’t call it that, but yeah!  All righty. I’ll be back in-in a little bit. Unless you wanna come with me?  No, no, you can get one yourself. It’ll be on the house! Y\\'know what are big sisters for?  No, no, no, I wouldn’t do you myself, I mean that would be weird. Yeah, no, I’ll get one of the other girls to do it. Oh, this will be so much fun! Hey! Are you excited?  Hey!-Hey! What’s going on?  You can’t have sex with her!  Okay, Jasmine, can you, can you ask Mr. Whiffler if he can wait for like five minutes.  Nooo! Why would you think that?  Whatever, it’s the perfect end to the perfect weekend anyways.  You really thought it was perfect?  Yeah, um, which ones in particular were great for you?  I don’t....  Right, okay, um-mm.  Yeah, I guess I do, yeah.  Well, I-I wasn’t hopping mad, y\\'know.  Okay. All right, this is my favourite part of the weekend, right now, this.  Uh-huh.  She wasn’t a hooker.  Maybe all the rulers are wrong.  Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh. Ugly Naked Guy is decorating his tree. Oh my God, you should see the size of his Christmas Balls.  I can see that. A plate of brownies once told me a limerick.  Not especially. But you know what, I think they had pot in them.  Hey.  This is my father, this is a picture of my dad.  No it isn\\'t, this is my dad, alright, I\\'ll show you.  No, that\\'s my stepdad. My real dad\\'s the one that ran out on us before I was born.  Hi Gram. Whatcha doin\\'?  Um, gram, um, can I see the pictures of my dad again?  Just, you know, to see... um.  OK, is this really my father?  OK, I smell smoke. Maybe that\\'s \\'cause someone\\'s pants are on fire.  Ya know, in all the years that we have been grandmother and granddaughter, you have never lied to me.  Oh God.  Alright, so, what, he\\'s not a famous tree surgeon? And then, I guess, OK, he doesn\\'t live in a hut in Burma where there\\'s no phones?  OK, that makes no sense. Why would the villagers worship a pharmacist?  Oh.  Hello grandma, if that is in fact your real name.  Well, not so good. Upstate\\'s pretty big, he\\'s pretty small, you do the math.  No I just, just wanted to know who he was, ya know.  Whattaya mean?  Wow. Thank you.  Hey.  Can you believe this. In, like, two hours I\\'m gonna have a dad. Eeeshk.  OK, let\\'s go.  Uh-huh, yeah, that\\'s my cheat sheet.  Wow, this is it, I\\'m gonna meet my dad. This is like the biggest thing ever, huh.  OK, here I go. I\\'m goin\\' in.  OK.  Mailbox.  Uh-huh.  No, it\\'s just like, ya know, it\\'s a whole mess of stuff, ya know. It\\'s like, yesterday, ya know, my dad was this, like, famous Burma tree surgeon guy and, ya know, now he\\'s a, a pharmacist guy and. . .  Yeah, maybe, yeah. You know, and, and I\\'ll knock on the door and, and he\\'ll hug me and I\\'ll have a dad. Ya know and I\\'ll, I\\'ll go to his pharmacy and everyone will be really nice to me \\'cause, you know, I\\'m Franks daughter.  Well, \\'cause, I mean, what if, what if he\\'s not this great dad guy? I mean, what if, what if he\\'s just still the dirtbag who ran out on my mom and us? You know what? I\\'ve already lost a fake dad this week and I don\\'t think I\\'m ready to lose a real one.  Yeah?  You guys. I\\'m sorry about your shopping.  Oh, I couldn\\'t go in.  Yeah, yeah, no it\\'s OK \\'cause, I mean, I know he\\'s there, so, that\\'s enough for now.  Ahh, toilet seat covers! Is that what you were doing while I was getting gas?  You guuuyys.  Hi  Oh God.� Remember the girls\\' nights we used to have sitting around talking about you and Ross?  Oh my God!� I love things.� What happened?  Eye-contact?  I hope you were using protection.  Oooh.� Let\\'s do.� Let\\'s send them mashed potatoes.  So?� What if they do?  Yeah, but, ah, ah, nothing has to happen.� We\\'re just having fun.� You know, not everything had to go as far as \"eye-contact.\"  Yeah. . . I\\'m sorry.� We weren\\'t really looking for anything to happen with you guys.� I, I have a boyfriend.  What about Ross?� What about your moment?� Don\\'t you want to talk to Ross about it?  Yeah, I see what you mean.� By the way, nice Ross imitation.  But, your Rachel wasn\\'t whiny enough.  Really?� You\\'re moving on from Ross?  Well, you kind of just did.� That guy is going to call you tonight.� Ross is going to pick up the phone and that\\'s a pretty clear message.  Well, you have to go back in.  I\\'m so sorry honey, but, okay, Rachel gave this guy her number and, um, she doesn\\'t want Ross to answer the phone.� So, you have to intercept all his calls.  Oh.  I\\'m fine, thanks.  Okay. Bye!  So, what movie should we see?  What?! Really?!  I can\\'t believe this!  No, but it is fast. Isn\\'t it?  No, I like him a lot but I don\\'t think I\\'m ready for this!  I don\\'t know. I\\'ll just handle it—I\\'ll ask you to talk to him!  Because you are so afraid of commitment! You talk to him, make him scared like you! Make him a…man!  Hmm, did you talk to Gary about the moving in thing?  What?!  You are useless! Freaking out about commitment is the one thing you can do! The one thing! And you can\\'t even do that right! God!  Yeah?  Uh-hmm.  Yeah?  That is so sweet. But don\\'t you think it\\'s a little too soon? I mean there\\'s so much we don\\'t know about each other.  I just—I don\\'t want us to jump into something we\\'re not ready for.  I really don\\'t want to mess up what we have. I\\'m just—I\\'m worried it\\'s gonna be a big mistake.  Which is why my answer is yes!  We\\'re moving in together! Isn\\'t it great! Yay!  I know, I\\'m so excited!  Well, you\\'re not more excited than I am! No way! I\\'m the most excited!  Okay, yeah, I\\'ll see you later! Don\\'t forget about the moving in!  I couldn\\'t tell him no. He got so sad. Maybe it\\'ll be all right. I do really like him a lot and probably do it eventually anyway and plus, think of all the money I\\'ll save on stamps.  No, I just heard when people live together, they split the cost of stamps. Don\\'t they?  Oh, I\\'m sorry, the oven mitts really freaked me out.  No, nothing.  Yeah.  Uh-huh!  Umm, yeah! Today\\'s.  Yeah?  That\\'s so sweet.  Living with you would make me happy.  No, I really wanna live with you! I wanna move in with you!  We could have breakfast in bed…  Oh yeah, that\\'s over.  He shot a bird!  Yeah. Yeah, I\\'ll be alright.  Yeah!  What are you talking about?!  Okay, let\\'s discuss Rachel\\'s birthday. I say we throw a surprise party this weekend.  Yeah but if we throw her a party on her birthday, then it\\'s not a surprise.  Okay, great so do you want to do it together?  Hey Rach, you wanna get some coffee?  Oh good!  Oh good.  Oh, look at that.  What happened to the intimate dinner party?  So wow, it looks like you took care of everything. Thanks a lot, co-host.  Like what?  Cups? You\\'re giving me cups?  I got it! Mine!  Is it okay if I leave this stuff here \\'til Rachel\\'s birthday party?  Umm, cups.  Yeah well, that\\'s \\'cause Monica put me in charge of cups and ice, and Monica is gonna rue the day that she put me in charge of cups and ice.  I was in charge of cups.  Okay!  Okayyyyy, open up!  Yeah, it’s for our catering business!  No, we’re gonna paint over the sword, and replace it with a baguette.  Oh sure, Cilantro Larry.  How could you say yes, what about our catering business?  Wow! Okay, dude alert! And who is this guy?  Ohh! Oh, the Chelsea Reporter, ohh, this used to keep me so warm.  Ooh, I gotta go. I found a guy that who could fix up the van for catering.  No-no, it’s okay. But are we sure we don’t want the waterbed?  Bye!  Hey, Monica!  Yeah.  Okay, is this the day of good news or what? I got us a job! The wedding reception.  But we’ve only had one job.  Yeah! What are you saying?  What?  You’re the cook! With out you it’s just me driving up to people’s houses with empty trays and asking for money!  Okay, I’m hearing.  What?!  I wa-I wa-I wa…  Monica!  No.  No.  Really?! Are you sure?  Yeah. That’s what you really want. Yeah, I don’t want to be the reason you’re unhappy, that would just make me unhappy, and I really don’t want to be the reason I’m unhappy.  Besides, it might be kinda fun to form the new A-Team.  I’m gonna get some coffee, anyone want anything?  Hey! Check it out! This is unbelievable! Joey has been holding his breath for almost four minutes!  Umm, I…I just think you don’t expect someone so hot to be so sweet.  Umm, Phoebe Buffay.  Get your foot off my contestant! Judge!  Ohhh.  Ohh, tough call.  Hey!  Wow! Nice! Manly and also kind of a slut.  Oh, please!  Hey!  Yeah, my mom sent me a family heirloom that once belonged to my grandmother. Can you believe it?! A year ago I didn\\'t even have a family, and now I have heirlooms for crying out loud.  Yeah! Why would my mother send me a fur? Doesn\\'t she know me but at all! Plus, I have a perfectly fine coat that no innocent animal suffered to make!  Oh my God! You got off easy! When my friend Silvie\\'s husband said someone else\\'s name in bed, she cursed him and turned his thingy green.  Oh, I hate this. Everything\\'s changing.  I don\\'t know what I\\'m gonna do about this coat.  Why?  Hey!  So listen, you know my friend Chris who owns the crematorium?  He says, that he would cremate my fur coat for free if I umm, y\\'know, bring in the next person I know who dies.  Nooo!!  I think he\\'s right. You guys hang out at the coffeehouse way too much.  Oh, I know.  Are you still mad at us?  Oh good! Because we have an \"I\\'m sorry\" song.  Okay, now you\\'re just taking lines right out of the song!  Yes! Exactly! And that\\'s why…  Okay, let\\'s get some perspective people; it\\'s not like I\\'m wearing a seeing-eye dog coat!  Oh God, I really missed that fat bastard!  Hi Emily!  Hey! I got you a present!!  I got it for your wedding and I ordered it weeks ago, and it finally got here!  It’s a Ms. Pac-Man machine!!  I didn’t know where to put it so I just left it here for now.  Do you really like it?  Oh really? What was your first?  No. No! Yes! Ahh. Oh, would you look at that Monica? I just knocked off all of your top scores, how sad.  Oh, I’m sorry. I didn’t hear you over all the winning.  Wait okay, if this game is gonna cause problems between the two of you, then maybe I should just keep it.  Yeah! It’s not like it spits out a Clark bar after every game.  Chandler sucks! He couldn’t have gotten this good!  I know!  Don’t touch me!!  Well that’s no way to sell newspapers. Why don’t you try, \"Extra! Extra! Read all about it!\"  Hey! Oh, how did baby shopping go?  What?!  Well did she know you two weren’t married?  Oh my God! Well the idea of a woman flirting with a-with a single man, we-we must alert the church elders!  Sounds like you’re a little jealous.  Hey Chandler, why so fancy?  Wait, I think I know someone who does that.  Yeah, just don’t get your hopes up.  Well, the interview…  Y’know! You don’t make a very good first impression.  Oh you don’t know.  Yes, when I first met you, you were like, \"Blah, blah, blah.\" I was like, shhh!  Well it’s just like you’re trying too hard. Always making jokes, y’know, you just—You come off a little needy.  Oh! It’s okay, you calm down after a while and then people can see how really sweet and wonderful you really are.  All right, don’t freak out! Okay? I-I will help you. How long before you have to leave?  I can’t help you.  All right, all right, we’ll just do our best. Okay? So let’s say I’m the interviewer and I’m meeting you for the first time. Okay. \"Hi! Come on in, I’m uh, Regina Philange.\"  Bing, what an unusual name.  Um-hmm, that’s good to know. But let’s stop focusing on what you don’t do, and start focusing on what you do do.  I see. Nice sidestep on the do do thing by the way.  You gotta go!  Okay, don’t worry. You’re ready.  Absolutely! Just fight all your natural instincts and you’ll be great.  Oh! Yeah, this is fun, couples night.  Wow!  Hey Mon? Was it weird changing your name to Geller-Bing?  Where did you go to do it?  Thanks! Honey, would you want me to take your name?  All right, let\\'s see, call me mrs Hannigan.  What? Can\\'t you see I\\'m in the middle of something? Ooh, I like it.  Okay!  Good for you. That was really mature.  Joey, you can\\'t make someone do something they don\\'t want to do. Believe me, there\\'s something I\\'ve been trying to get Mike to do in bed and there\\'s... he\\'s just...  All right, prude... Look, Monica and Chandler really love this house. You are not gonna talk them into staying here.  Okay, well, I just don\\'t, I don\\'t know how it works exactly. See, my name is Buffay and my husband\\'s name is Hannigan, so is it supposed to be Buffay-Hannigan or Hannigan-Buffay?  Well, not anything, I mean...  Oh, this could take a while.  Okay.  Hey!  Oh, not anymore. I changed it today.  Wrong again! Apparently you can change it to anything you want. So I thought, all right, here\\'s an opportunity to be creative. So meet Princess Consuela Banana Hammock.  Uh! Princess Consuela.  Uh-huh!  Uhm, no. I\\'m gonna have my friends call me Valerie.  What are you, what are you talking about? How did this happen?  Ross...  Can you?  Oh God!  Welcome back!  Oh, me too!  Well, I\\'m no longer Phoebe Buffay.  Nope.  Yep.  Why? It\\'s fun, it\\'s different, no-one else has a name like it.  Great, okay, what are you gonna change it to?  You\\'re not serious, right?  Uhu, uhu, well, then, great. If you love it, I love it.  And I love Crap.  Thank you, mister Bag.  Yeah.  Yeah... Ogh... Okay, fine. You made your point. Can you please just be Mike Hannigan again?  How about uhm... How about Buffay-Hannigan?  Yeah. I\\'m Phoebe Buffay-Hannigan Banana Hammock.  It\\'s a funny word.  ...Oh crap!  Huh?  Oh, yeah, it\\'s my mom\\'s.  And maybe I could teach Ben about the Christmas skull and how people die.  Hey. Guess what! My landlord just called and my apartment is gonna get ready soon, so I guess I\\'ll be moving out.  Yes, you will be very sad. All right, well I gotta go tell Rachel the good news.  Yeah, why not?  Why do you think, she\\'s having so much fun living with Joey?  Really? So she said, she didn’t wanna live with me anymore?  You\\'re sure? You\\'re absolutely sure?  So you like the drums! That\\'s, that\\'s great! Y’know, I was worried, that, you know, they would maybe an unbearable living situation. All right, okay, well, apparently not! So, yay!  Hey!  Yes, thank you. You see, this is how normal people are supposed to react to drums.  Maybe on some level.  Our apartment is ready.  Because you would rather live here with Joey.  Monica and Chandler said that you were having so much fun here. And apparently no amount of drums or tarantulas is gonna change that.  Hm?  Yes, but I wanted you to want to live with me, but okay, if you\\'re having so much fun over here…  We did have fun, didn\\'t we?  Oh, anyway, they say, if we want, we can see it tonight.  Yay, okay!  Great, all right, okay, and Monica ask me to make the drumming stop.  Oh, this is terrible. Oh, they’ve made so many changes I can’t even feel my grandmother’s presence anymore—Ooh! New sconces!  What?  Yeah?  Yeah?  Well, I guess we’ll just have to put the wall back up.  A little bit, yeah.  You heard her too?! You have the gift!  Are you sure?  Oh me too.  No, I do not hear that.  Oh.  Oh.  Okay, I understand why Superman is here, but why is there a porcupine at the Easter Bunny’s funeral?  Your welcome, oh please not the one with the turtles.  Umm, no, it\\'s a purse. And there\\'s a thermos in it.  A stripper at a bachelor party, that is so clich�. Why don\\'t you get a magician?!  Well, can you dance at all?  Oh, how was last night with Julio, senorita?  Oh yeah.  Oh my God, oh my God! Poor Monica!  Oh, totally. Oh, God, oh, she seemed so happy too.  What are you wrapping?  Yeah, it\\'s a vase.  Well not exactly like the one in the poem.  How come?  Okay, I didn’t hear that.  That’s weird.  Your nails.  Oh, no, I meant that it’s weird that you only have nine now.  And! Whoever finds it wins the prize!  I don’t get it.  Op, the ruined quiches are ready.  Hey!  Well, who cares what your Mom thinks? So you pulled a Monica.  No but, why does that have to be a bad thing. Just change what it means. Y\\'know? Go down there and prove your Mother wrong. Finish the job you were hired to do, and we’ll call that pulling a Monica.  Okay, umm, if a kid gets straight A’s, his parents would say, \"Yeah, he pulled a Monica.\" Y\\'know? Or a fireman saves a baby, and they go, \"Yeah I know, he pulled a Monica.\" Or someone hits a homerun and the announcer says, \"Yeah, that one’s outta here.\" Though some things don’t change.  They’re not even touching the lasagna!  Oh, they love your casserole.  It’s hard to believe that just a little while ago this was nothing but ingredients.  Oh.  Oh God, Korea is such a beautiful country.  Ooh, I\\'ll go in on that with you! I couldn\\'t think of anything.  Hey! I brought you some house warming gifts.  Yeah. Salt, so your life always has flavor.  Bread, so you never go hungry.  And a scented candle for the bathroom, because well, y\\'know.  Yeah!  Mr. President.  Yeah. I really like his glasses.  Oh, hi Ross!  Yeah, uh-huh, a 100 dollars.  Yeah, but they didn\\'t ask me! Y\\'know? This way I\\'m just y\\'know, the exotic, generous stranger. That\\'s always fun to be.  No I\\'m not. No! If anything I\\'m making you look better! They\\'ll see you talking to me and that\\'s--I\\'m a hit!  Hey!  Yeah, okay, my bad.  No! No! I\\'m talking you up to people. Just give it a little time, all right? Relax, get something to eat! Okay?  Oh, I was telling them about you and Emily. Y\\'know, try to get some sympathy.  But somehow you came off as the bad guy.  Yeah, I think I told it wrong. Y\\'know, we should talk about that because I don\\'t totally understand what happened there.  Oh, okay, see? Things are looking up already!  Obviously I didn\\'t think they were gonna start throwing things. I just thought if I kept insulting everyone, you would jump in and defend everyone and then you could look like the hero.  Aw, and I was gonna ask you to marry me because I forgot to say hello to you last week.  Hey!  It\\'s really crazy! The hall, the dress, the food... I-I had no idea how expensive this stuff was!  So what did you two do about it?  But really, it does seem like this money could be put to better use?  Yeah! Now, how would you feel if we gave all the wedding money to charity and we just got married at City Hall?  Yes. We\\'re here to make a rather sizeable donation to the children.  And we don\\'t want any recognition. This is completely anonymous.  Mr. X and Phoebe Buffay.  Buffay is spelled B-U-F-F-A-Y.  Sure, I so glad we did this. It feels so good!  Mhm... it\\'s moist.  Hello, is this the creepy residence?  Awe, this is so sweet of you! But you know what? I won’t be needing a veil, I actually won’t be wearing a dress at all!  No, no, no, we’re not having a big reception, we took the money we were gonna spend on a wedding and we donate them to the children charity.  City Hall.  Well, I’ll just ask for it back!  It’s for our wedding day! Right, now, is this guy gay or straight, because one of us gonna have to start flirting.  The donation we made earlier, we k…, we w…, we want it back.  Yeah. See, that money was for a big wedding, that we thought we didn’t want, but it turns out we do.  I am sorry. I am, but this wedding is just really important to me.  Yeah, I really do. You know, I had nothing growing up. (thinks for a few  Look, I can\\'t have a wedding with this money now. It\\'s tainted.  And if that guy at the charity gives us a hard time, my friend hasn\\'t shot  Yeah, because you know what, it\\'s... it\\'s all about the children.  But... but... but we\\'re giving you this!  Oh, is that you?  You’ve got to get out of here! Save yourself!  Don’t worry about me, I’m a robot! I’m just a machine!!  I am extremely talented!  Oh yeah, you’re solid. Yeah, you’re just no me.  I am.   Oh, Boy Scouts could\\'ve camped under it!   It\\'s not that bad.   Chandler, Chandler.  Oh!  All right.  Now, let\\'s not do this!  Happy thoughts!  Happy thoughts!  OK, now I\\'m gonna kick some ass.  I know!  I know!  I know!  Alright, now I will let go if you both stop.  There we go.You know what, if we were in prison, you guys would be, like, my bitches.  I thought you were excellent! In fact for a minute there I was like, \"Ooh, where’d Ross go?\"  Yeah?  Yeah, well me too, yeah. I think that\\'s the challenge.  So why don\\'t ya show us the rest of your casa?  Oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God. You are not gonna believe this. I have just been discovered.  Anyway, OK, now promise you won\\'t like, freak out and say how great this is until I\\'m done, OK.  OK. I just met this producer of this like, teeny record company, who said that I have a very fresh, offbeat sound and she wants to do a demo of Smelly Cat.  I told you not to do that yet. And, she wants to do a video.  I\\'m not done yet, OK. God. OK, if that goes well, they may even want to make an album.  I\\'m done now.  Joey, why don\\'t you talk to Chandler about moving back?  OH!! Oh I thought they were just watching me. You know, like at, like at an aquarium, ya know.  Oh OK. So, um, the cat stinks but you love it, let\\'s go.  Hey.  Oh, check it out, oh check it out. It\\'s Smelly Cat the video.  Oh my God.  I sound amazing. I, I, I\\'ve never heard myself sing before. I mean, except in my own head. Oh, this is so cool, now I can hear what you hear.  Oh, I am sorry but I am incredibly talented.  Hey.  Listen. You are not going to believe this but, that is not me singing on the video.  Yes.  Well, OK, the record company sent over this piece of paper for me to sign, saying that it\\'s OK for someone else to sing for me. That was my first clue.  Well, I can\\'t work with people who would do this.  I mean this poor woman.  The voice woman. Ya know, I mean, she has a great voice but she doesn\\'t have a video.  Well I have a video, you have to pay attention. No this, this voice woman, she\\'s so talented but, according to the producer people, they said she doesn\\'t have like the right look or something, ya know. I mean, it\\'s like, she\\'s like one of those an imals at the pound who like nobody wants \\'cause they\\'re not pretty enough or you know. Like, like some old dog who\\'s just kind of like stinky and. Huuuuh, oh my God, she\\'s smelly cat. Oh, oh that song has so many levels.  Monica.  Chandler.  Rachel.  Uh, Ross, those are the only lines we have, sorry. OK, you guys, once more.  Oh my God Eric hi! Wait, how’d you get this number?  Wow! What an incredible violation—and wonderful surprise.  Shhh! I’m talking.  Are you asking me out? ‘Cause it would be kinda weird since you just broke up with my sister.  No! Wait! I was just saying that so you’d think I was a good person. Fight for me.  Not great, but we can work on it at lunch. Okay, I can be at your apartment in two hours.  I’ve got friends too. Okay, bye.  Hi!  Yeah, me too. Not in the shaky angry way you are though.  Oh.  Maybe this is too weird.  No don’t tear out your eyes!!  Ooh, oh no! I have to go! I have a massage appointment.  No, I got in trouble for that before. I’ll see you later.  Why?  What sex?  We didn’t have sex.  You-you…you had sex with Ursula?!  You didn’t notice she was wearing different clothes?!  Oh. Ew! Ew! Ew! Ugh! Y’know what? This is too weird.  So I guess this is it.  Yeah, so do you.  Hey!  Yes, I do! Today is Mike and my one-year anniversary.  YEAH!  Uh-uh. Ehm, a Knicks game.  Hey, you know what, I\\'ve never had a one-year anniversary before, so no matter where we go, I\\'m wearing something fancy pants, and... I\\'m gonna put on my finest jewelry and we\\'re gonna have sex in a public rest room.  ME TOO! I NEVER THOUGHT I COULD LOVE SOMEONE THIS MUCH!  Oh how lame... oh, it’s so tacky, and impersonal.  Oh, it’s the worst way to propose!  Hi. I just had the worst anniversary ever.  Well, mine was worse than that.  We were at the game, and this guy proposed to his girlfriend on the big screen thing...  Well, that’s what I said, but it turns out, Mike was planning on proposing to me that same way last night!  Yeah, I really do! Yes, but, after I dumped on the way he was gonna propose to me, I don’t think he’s ever gonna ask again! I mean, I said no in Barbados and now this!  Oh, I don\\'t know, I don\\'t know, isn\\'t that a little desperate?  Ok, ok, so how should I do it?  No, I\\'ve got work and then I\\'m proposing..  Well, I think you should wait.  Well, if you don\\'t... if you don\\'t hold it in, you don\\'t get all the nutrients.  That\\'s not very enlightened!  That woman at the game didn\\'t know what she was talking about. Mike, obviously you have balls.  It\\'s in the cake, isn\\'t it?  What\\'s the matter with me? How do I keep ruining this? I\\'m sorry, I\\'m sorry!  Oh my God!  Yes!  I love you more!  I know. But don\\'t you think that it should be called Order and Law?  Don\\'t get me started on that.  Sounds like somebody wants to be Mr. Pizza Delivery Girl.  See? Vegetarianism benefits everyone.  This is so cool!  But I like it here!  Okay, well I think that they\\'re in my purse. Why don\\'t you go get dressed and I\\'ll look for them.  Wait, Rach! Where\\'s the other one?  Rachel Karen Green, where\\'s the other earring?!  Well, what am I going to tell Monica? She wants to wear them tonight!  These are her earrings.  Why not?  On your dresser.  But I already gave them back to you!  Make sure you check Chandler\\'s jewelry box.  Okay, we have like ten minutes. Do you want me to get into that now?!  No, that would be, \"Why are you being cute?\"  Ohh! I did not get that.  Did you find it?  Okay, those are my sunglasses, you borrowed them from me.  All right well, we\\'re just gonna have to tell Monica, that\\'s all.  I suppose I could tell her it\\'s just all my fault.  Mon, can I talk to you for a sec?  Umm, I lost one of your earrings. I\\'m sorry! I am so, so sorry!  I will replace it, I promise. I feel so terrible.  No.  Yeah! You\\'re the best!  I-I-I found it interesting.  What else do they add smell too?  Oh no!  I am definitely gonna watch that!  Definitely!  Oh, then no.  So, uh, why didn\\'t you say anything?  Okay, they\\'re just talking...  No, no actually, he\\'s smiling.. and... Oh my God, don\\'t do that!!  Not a good day for birds...  You cook naked?  Y\\'know, if you want, you can call her machine, and if she has a lot of beeps, that means she probably didn\\'t get her messages yet.  How many beeps?  How\\'d he take it?  Sex in his chair.  Where are you going?  Radiator.  Rdtor.  You know he\\'s gay?  Whoo-hoo!  Yeah! Have a great honeymoon!  It was his sweater, but—Oh my God!  Yeah, bye.  Oh, it\\'s so romantic to send people off on their honeymoon.  All in good time my love. All in good time. Oh shoot! I left my guitar in their apartment. Well you can let me in later.  What?! They took mine to give to you!  Maybe they don’t trust us.  You mean the time you broke the ketchup bottle and cleaned it up with Monica’s guest towels?  No you didn’t.  Well, what am I gonna do? I really need my guitar!  What stuff?  Did Rachel find you?  Oh she was looking for you.  Well, she really wanted to talk to you now.  What?  Of course I do! And I’m gonna give it back to you as soon as they’re done with it at the key shining place.  Well why don’t you use your key?  Oh! We could have done that.  Oh great! And listen, could you do us a favor and not tell Chandler and Monica about this? ‘Cause y’know umm, they don’t-they don’t have any kids of their own and-and this door was like a child to them.  Oh no.  Didn’t you two already talk?  That is brand new information!!  A little bit.  Oh Ross.  Hey! So how was the doctor?  Good.  Oh.  Ugh, PBS!  Ugh, what\\'s right with them?  Okay, \\'cause right after my mom killed herself, I was just in this really bad place, y\\'know personally. So, I just thought that it\\'d make me feel better if I wrote to Sesame Street, \\'cause they were so nice when I was a little kid! No one ever wrote back.  All I got was a lousy key chain! And by that time I was living in a box. I didn\\'t have keys!  This isn\\'t a good deed, you just wanted to get on TV! This is totally selfish.  What-what are you talking about?!  Yeah. So?  Yes there are! There are totally good deeds that are selfless.  Yeah, it\\'s… Y\\'know there\\'s—no you may not!  Are you calling me selfish?!  I\\'m gonna find a selfless good dead. I\\'m gonna beat you, you evil genius.  Hey, Joey, when you said the deal with Santa Clause, you meant?  I cannot believe I can\\'t find a selfless good deed! Y\\'know that old guy that lives next to me? Well, I snuck over there and-and raked up all the leaves on his front stoop. But he caught me and force-fed me cider and cookies. Then I felt wonderful. That old jackass!  I will find a selfless good deed! \\'Cause I just gave birth to three children and I will not let them be raised in a world where Joey is right!  Ooh-ohh!  Why?  Yeah.  Yeah, but you\\'ve known Rachel since High School and you cannot just cut her out of your life.  Well, it helps the bee look tough in front of his bee friends. The bee is happy and I am definitely not.  Ooh, it\\'s not a toy.  I would like to make a pledge. I would like to donate $200.  Oh, I\\'m still mad at them but I also now that they bring happiness to lots of kids who\\'s moms didn\\'t kill themselves, so by supporting them, I\\'m doing a good thing, but I\\'m not happy about it. So there, a selfless good deed.  No, it sucks. I was saving up to buy a hamster.  Yeah, not the one I had my eye on.  Hey, it’s your Thanksgiving too, y\\'know, instead of watching football, you could help.  Oh, can I play too? I’ve never played football, like ever.  Yay!!  Okay, so how do we decide that?  Wait for me! Wait for me! Wait for me! Oh cool, this is my first huddle.  Okay, so what do you guys really think of Chandler?  Yeah.  What’s block?  I thought you meant in life.  Go! Go! Go!  Touchdown!! Touchdown!!  Well, okay, I made a touchdown. It was my first touchdown. So?  Oh my God!  Woo-yay!!  I love this game!!  Oh my God! You dated someone with a glass eye too?!  All right, no, well I want to kill them to, but their boys, y\\'know how are we gonna beat three boys?  Come on Mon, let her throw the ball.  Okay. Oooh! Oh, this is our last huddle, yeah.  Wait-wait-wait-wait! So, explain something to me though, if, if nobody tagged Rachel, then isn’t the play still going.  Isn’t there a national football league.  Umm, this stuffing is amazing. Do you think we should bring them some?  Y\\'know what that means?  I know! So this woman probably could like have all kinds of stories about my parents, and she might even know like where my Dad is. So I looked her up, and she lives out by the beach. So maybe this weekend we could go to the beach?  So great! Okay! Tomorrow we’re gonna drive out to Montauk.  Oh, I am having the best karma this week. First, I find this woman who knew my parents, and then my client with the fuzzy back gives me his beach house.  Oh, I wasn’t talking about his karma.  And this time, they’ve ganged up to form one giant, super hat.  Oy!!  Oh, yeah, Bob said there might be flood damage.  Hi Phoebe Abott, I’m your best friends daughter!  Yes!! Yes! Yes! Yes!! That’s my Dad, that’s Frank! Yeah! I’m sorry I’m getting all flingy.  No-no, sorry. Cookies are good, thanks.  Oh, what? What was it?  Oh, so, how are we doing?  I’m kind, caring, and sweet. What’s Monica like?  Ohh, I think she knows where my Dad is.  I don’t know, but we’re having dinner tomorrow night, so I figured, she’s gonna tell me then. Y\\'know maybe she just wanted to give him time to, buy me presents, I don’t know! So, you’re all bored?  All right, I’m gonna close my eyes and point to someone, and you, whoever I point has to come up with something fun for us to do, and we have to do it.  Okay.  Monica, if you get five cool points, you get to make somebody take off one item of clothing. It hasn’t happened yet, but we’re all very excited.  Come on, take ‘em off!!  Shhh! Shhhh! Joey’s asleep.  After he passed out, we put the sand around him to keep him warm.  She cancelled! My namesake cancelled on me!  Yeah, she clamed she had to go out of town suddenly. She’s avoiding me, she doesn’t want to tell me where my Father is. She knows, and she won’t tell me.  Well, she’s out of town so, there’s gotta be something in her house that tells me where my Father is.  Well, are any of those people here?!  Okay, look I-I-I do something nice, okay? I’ll-I’ll fill her ice trays.  No! No!! It’s me! It’s me! I-I didn’t want to make any noise!  I’m sorry.  I-I, came to fill your ice cube trays.  My Father is Chuck Magioni?  Oh.  Heh?  I didn’t know Playboy prints jokes.  Wh-wh-what are you doing?  Oh, yeah. Aw, remember the days when you used to go out to the barn, lift up your shirt, and bend over?  Rachel.  I guess it was kinda funny.  Fine. The reason that I was leaning a little bit more toward Rachel than you is just that you’re … just … kinda high maintenance—Okay let’s go to lunch!  No, okay, you’re right. You’re easy-going. You’re just not as easy-going as Rachel. She’s just more flexible and-and mellow. That’s all.  Ya, you know, Rachel … she’ll do whatever you want. Y’know, you can just walk all over her.  Okay.  That true, I am flaky.  Yeah, totally.  That’s great. Good for you guys.  Who said you were?  Oh, I’m flaky. I’ll say anything.  Really? I’ve heard better.  Wow! That is a bad audition.  Hey, I never got to hear who you guys would pick to be your girlfriend.  Yeah, well, I kinda thought.  Turkey’s are beautiful, intelligent animals!  Happy Thanksgiving!  Anything I can do to help?  Sure!  What?  I don’t believe you! That is…brilliant! And Monica has no idea?  Well I want to get in on this. Hey Mon? I don’t think I can help you after all, I didn’t realize this game was on.  Well it’s only like my favorite bay! {Actually, it’s not bad. It just gets a little cold in winter, but in Wisconsin winter only lasts from August to June. J }  Oh okay.  Noooo!! Damn you ref! You burn in hell!!!  Yeah.  Well the Lions technically won, but it was a moral victory for the Green Bay…Mermen.  I think you do.  What?! What else did you do?  Oh, come on Will! Just take off your shirt and tell us!  So how did this happen? Did she, did she lure you to an early bird dinner?  I wanna join!  I’m sorry. I’m sorry. I never got to be in a club. I-I didn’t go to high school, but three of us would meet behind a dumpster to learn French. Bonjour.  Joey! Those are my maternity pants!  Is there anything we can do for you?  Now wasn’t Joey hitting on her at the wedding too?  Wait a second! So, what’s new with you?  What?!  Really?  Yeah. Okay. Umm, y’know, my friends are having a Halloween party tonight at my old apartment so, you could come. Maybe I could meet the guy you’re marrying.  By the way, it’s a costume party.  Ah, Catwoman. So we meet again.  No, it’s me. Phoebe!  No wonder your pregnant.  Okay, I will. But right after you tell me who the hell you are.  Ursula’s fianc�e?  Yeah.  Yeah.  My mother killed herself.  No-no! That’s okay, we’ll just start over. Okay? Hi! I’m Phoebe.  Why are you looking at me like that?  I love the second grade!  Yeah! It’s so much better than first grade when you don’t know what’s going on and definitely better than third grade. Y’know with all the politics and mind games.  No I’m having fun. I’m really—And I’m really-really excited for you and Ursula.  Thank you.  What?  No I’m not! You are!  Two weeks? That’s it?  Oh really?  Hi liar!  Y’know the only reason he’s marrying you is because he thinks all the things you were saying about yourself were true.  But they’re not!  Why are you lying to him?  You too. And Ursula?! It was really nice meeting you tonight!!  Hmm?  Oh.  Sure it does. Yeah, yeah.  Umm listen, I don’t think…I don’t think I’m gonna make it to the wedding. So I just want to wish you all the luck in the world.  Okay I can’t let you do this! She’s lying to you.  No. You’re not, you’re not stupid.  Monica, I\\'m sorry I didn\\'t come by last night. I was out with Gary; he let me ride around with him in his cop car. We saw and prevented crimes.  Uh-huh!  Hi!  My God, Joey!  Okay!  Bye!  Yes. Once. Yeah, a little. He kinda did it to himself. It\\'s not really a good story.  Hey, everybody. Happy Thanksgiving!  Hey, what\\'s going on Joe?  Oh okay. How about the whole \"man walking on the moon\" thing. You know? You. you could. You could see the strings people!  Ooh, honey. You stink at lying.  Oh really. Okay. let me ask you something. Yesterday at the coffee house, I went to the bathroom and when I came back, my muffin was gone-who took it?  Don\\'t worry, don\\'t worry. We\\'ll come up with a good lie. I\\'ll help you practice it.  Sure, what.. what was the work thing?  \"Pick up grandma at the airport\"?  Oh right, ok um. Ok so its not just the lie you tell. but its the way you tell it. . For example if you look down at the ground when you\\'re talking, people know you\\'re lying.  Thats a great movie. <she claps>  PHOE-BE.  There\\'s your movie! <claps>  It\\'s ok. I thought of the perfect lie for you. It\\'s easy to remember and doesn\\'t invite a lot of questions. You weren\\'t at the parade because you had a family emergency.  Ooh, what happened?  No! Nothing with a raccoon.  Yeah we thought it would be nice to use the fancy china for dessert too.  Oh my god! Shouldn\\'t we stop this?  It\\'s all right. You can mourn.  Hey, does Monica know about her broken plates yet?  Broke them all, huh?  You gonna tell her?  \\'Cause he was creepy, and mean, and a little frightening... alright, still, it\\'s nice to have a date on Valentine\\'s Day!  I know I am. That\\'s why I can\\'t wear a digital watch.  Oh! You know my friend Abby who shaves her head? She said that if you want to break the bad boyfriend cycle, you can do like a cleansing ritual.  Yeah. So, we can do it tomorrow night, you guys. It\\'s Valentine\\'s Day. It\\'s perfect.  Ok. We can, um, we can burn the stuff they gave us.  Or...or we can chant and dance around naked, you know, with sticks.  Ok, so now we need, um sage branches and the sacramental wine.  Ok, and I have the, uh receipt for my dinner with Nokululu Oon Ah Ah.  See, there you go, the cleansing works!  Oh, thanks. I couldn\\'t uh...  Um, no, huh-uh. One of my clients died on the massage table today.  Yeah, um, she was 82 years old. Her name was um, Mrs. Adelman.  Yeah, it\\'s just so strange. I mean, she probably woke up today and thought, \"ok, I\\'ll have some breakfast, and then I\\'ll take a little walk, and then I\\'ll have my massage.\" Little did she know God was thinking, \"Ok, but that\\'s it.\" Oh, but the weirdest thing was, ok, I was cleansing her aura when she died, and when the spirit left her body, I don\\'t think it went very far.  I think it went into me.  I know who it is you remind me of. Evelyn Dermer. \\'Course, that\\'s before she got the lousy face lift. Now she looks like Soupy Sales.  I don\\'t know. Who\\'s Soupy Sales?  That\\'s him.  Yes, hi, Mr. Adelman. Thanks for meeting me.  Um, do you wanna sit?  I don\\'t know how to say this, but I think when your wife\\'s spirit left her body, it um, kind of stuck around in me.  Yeah. Ok, you don\\'t have to believe me but um, can you think of any unfinished business she might have had, like any reason she\\'d be hanging around?  Everything?  Whoa, that\\'s a lot of stuff.  I\\'m sorry, there\\'s laughing in my head.  Monica, how did this happen? I thought you had this all planned out.  Sir! No sir!  I miss Rose.  I know it\\'s kind of weird, but I mean, she was a big part of my life there, you know, and now I just feel kind of alone.  Ok, that\\'s so nice.  Yeah, me, too, technically.  So good!  I-I\\'m sorry it wasn\\'t one of those movies with, like, y\\'know, guns and bombs and, like, buses going really fast...  Whoah, ooh, why is the air in here so negative?  Oh no, how?  Which one?  No, which one? The right or left? \\'Cause the left one is lucky...  Why would you leave your Belgian waffle in the hall?  Oh, is that who the monkey\\'s named after?  Oh my God. You\\'d put that poor little creature in jail?  Yes, but there isn\\'t always time!  Dun-dun-duuuur! Sorry.  Marcel?  Marcel?  Oh-my-God!  Something just brushed up against my right leg!  Oh, it\\'s okay, it was just my left leg.  Yeah! Oh, c\\'mere, Marcel! Oh, Marcel, c\\'mere!  Oh, this is so intense. One side of my butt is totally asleep, and the other side has no idea.  Nope.  Oh my God, you guys are selling the entertainment center?  Yeah, I actually don’t know...  Nothing. Nothing.  I just, I just have this really strong feeling that this cat is my Mother.  No, no-no, she was a human lady. This is the spirit of my Mom Lily, the one who killed herself.  Yeah?  So great. Oh, we took a nap today and my Mom fell asleep on my tummy and purred.  I just feel so, uhh.....  Oh yeah, your microwave. The stereo.  Ohh. Um-hmm. But y\\'know, she choose to find me. I mean, I have to respect her decision. Right?  Okay, then you don’t know what it feels like when one of them comes back. Do you? I believe this is my Mother. Even if I’m wrong, who cares? Just be a friend. Okay? Be supportive.  Okay.  I think she would like that.  Thank you. We both forgive you.  Yeah, okay, listen, umm, Mom, I hope you know you still mean a lot to me. And you’re welcome to come back anytime.  Come on, Mom, I’ll take you home.  Oh-ho yeah! A song with rhyming words. Oo, I never thought of that before.  Okay, see, see, everyone else is happy she’s done.  Oh no, one of those ‘look for the hidden meaning’ songs.  Hey Leslie, how’d you know I’d be here?  Actually I said she abandoned me to write jingles.  Hmm, bummer.  No. But thanks.  Okay. No. But thanks.  Where’s Chandler?  Yeah, that was Leslie calling again to see if we can get back together. That’s the twentieth time today! And good luck Leslie!  Well, yeah. Y\\'know, we were best friends, ever since we were little, our Moms worked on the barge together.  You never run on a barge!  Oh my God!! You threw Pepper on the fire!  It’s just y\\'know, been a couple of hours, and she hasn’t called. Not that I even care, y\\'know.  You think you know me so well.  Yeah.  That’s what I said.  I can’t. I can’t. She dumped me, I mean I totally trusted her and then one day it was ‘Okay, bye Pheebs’ gone. Y\\'know what the saddest part is, when we were playing together, that was like the most fun I’ve ever had in like all my lives.  Oh, yeah!  I..., a jingle? No, no-no-no, no.  Okay, well if I was in this for the money, I’d be a millionaire by now, y\\'know. You just got to get out of that jingle head sweetie.  Okay, don’t give me a reason to get mad, okay  No, look, I told you that I didn’t want you to try and sell it, and you just, you big fat did it anyway. God, y\\'know what, I think five years ago I probably would’ve done anything to play with you but, I can do it by myself. And if I can’t trust you then just forget it.  Okay y\\'know what you have to choose. All right, if-if the most important thing on the planet to you is this cat poopy thing then, okay you can have Smelly Cat, but we won’t be partners. So what’s it gonna be?  Yeah. I actually am, yeah. Y\\'know life-life’s gonna had you all kinds of stuff, y\\'know you learn your little lessons and hopefully you grow. Wanna hear a new song?  Ohh, give him a kiss for me!  Bye!  I\\'m trying, but man that guy can push my buttons!  Look, I don\\'t wanna talk about it. Okay?  You wanna be on my list too? Keep talking! Has anyone seem my list by the way?  Uh, it\\'s a piece of paper and it says, \"Ross\" on it.  Ohh-oh, chilling!  Oh wait, my grandmother\\'s dead.  No! No, her cab! She probably won\\'t be using it; you can drive it to Las Vegas.  Oh hey Joey! What\\'s up?  Yeah, I\\'ve been around.  Ooh, if you take the northern route there\\'s a man in Illinois with a beard of bees. {Okay, I must protest this, I\\'ve lived in Illinois all my life and know of no man with a beard of bees! Wisconsin, on the other hand, might be a different story.}  But on the southern route there\\'s a chicken that plays tic-tac-toe.  Oh, I know a way that you can decide! All right, I\\'m going to ask you a series of questions and you answer as quickly as you can.  Which would you rather be a fireman or a swimmer?  Who would you rather sleep with Monica or Rachel?  No thinking! No thinking! Tie or ascot?  North route or south route?  Bamn! There you go! Huh?  Thanks a lot! I just got that jerk out of my mind!  Bye!  Oh, I\\'m sorry. I didn\\'t see you there.  Well, if you don\\'t know I can\\'t help you.  Well, I can\\'t help you.  Apology accepted.  Uh-huh.  I don\\'t know! I don\\'t remember!  Oh no, I am mad at you. I know that much. But, I am sorry about the fat ass thing. You actually have a very sweet little hiney.  No.  No that made me feel precious.  That game should not be played without my supervision.  What\\'s in the bag?  I do!  Hey, dude!  No, don\\'t-don\\'t say I\\'m sorry with porn!  Y\\'know what you should send him? A cartoon of cigarettes. \\'Cause that why he could trade it for protection. No. That\\'s prison.  Uh-hmm.  Fauna.  Garfunkle.  You said I was boring--Ohh!  Oh my God, I remember now! We were playing chess!  To see if know what these guys are talking about.  Yay! It’s so exciting! Wow, you could’ve done that with us there.  Oh sure okay, you can touch yourself in front of us but you can’t talk to Rachel.  Oh please! Just before when you were asleep in the lounge! That Armenian family was watching you instead of the TV. Oh, that reminds me. That Mr. Hasmeje still has my Gameboy.  Hey!  Are you all right?  Oh my God! He did it?  Are you kidding? I’m like the one who talked him into it. I like to think of myself as the puppet master of the group.  I just talked him into it, don’t tell me I have to do you too. The puppet master gets tired people.  Why?! You two are so meant to be together, everybody thinks so.  Especially Ross!  There he goes, your fianc�e.  Although he does play with himself in his sleep.  Oh hey! Wait up!  Congratulations! I didn’t want to say anything in front of Joey ‘cause I didn’t know if he knew yet.  No! No, that you and Rachel are engaged!  Oh, it’s a secret. Oh goodie! Yes! We haven’t done the secret thing in a long time.  Are you lying? Is this like that time you tried to convince us that you were a doctor?  Perhaps because you gave her an engagement ring? Y’know Ross doctors are supposed to be smart.  Really?  So whose ring is it?  Is it an engagement ring?  But you didn’t give it to her?  But you were going to propose?  Huh, I might be losing interest in this.  Oh, what beautiful lukewarm sentiment.  No! No, she said you actually proposed to her.  Oh, hey, Mon, do you still have your like old blouses and dresses from high school?  Well, it’s just that maternity clothes are so expensive.  Personal shopping? What is that? Like where you walk around with snooty rich people and tell them what to buy?  That sounds great!  Hey!  Ooh! How was Kathy’s play?  That’s a good idea for a business!  Hey, Mel Gibson and Clint Eastwood.  Oh-okay, I get the game now.  Rachel has a new doll.  Ooh, what do I smell?  What? What?  Yeah, I don’t need it.  Well, why did you make like a whole big thing out of y\\'know, everyone has to hang out in the big apartment?  If you wanted to punish them, you should’ve just made them hang out here!  Oh, are we gonna trash that place?  Wait a minute.  Why don’t you ask him out?  He just got a divorce right?  So he’s probably really nervous around women, y\\'know? Maybe, you just have to make the first move.  Thousands of times!! That doesn’t make me sound too good does it?  Oh, please!  I’ve never done that.  No, sorry.  Great!  Oh did you—what did you—did you work for two days straight?  Oh good!  How? How is your fault?  Huh?  Sure. Yeah, he’s kinda sexy.  Okay so, we’ll just come up with some kind of signal if it’s going well you can take off.  Oh. Why not?  Oh Rachel, this is all so ‘Papa don’t preach.’  Wow! Oh well, I will be there!  Oh my God!!! Monica!! He’s the stripper from your bachelorette party!!  Your secret bachelorette party…  Oh, I-I don’t eat meat.  Yeah, I don’t eat that either.  He’s right though, the ’74 is absolute piss.  Rachel!  Why, so he can get mad at the baby?  It’s slang for pregnant.  I’m sorry I won’t be able to make it to your imaginary wedding, but I’m really busy that day. Yeah, I already have a unicorn baptism and a leprechaun bar mitzvah.  It’s Lafite. The ’74 Latour is actually drinking quite nicely.  That’s it?! You call that a fight? Come on! \"We were on a break!\" \"No we weren’t!\" What happened to you two?!  Wanna go see a movie?  Wow! Could everyone totally see up his robe?  Yeah, ooh, I like that! Yeah. Wait! How do you know about ‘bah-bah-bha-bhan?’  Oh yeah, that’s right, the keyboards, huh?  I wanna hear \"The Sound.\"  Come on, play that funky music white boy.  Wow, it was so—wow!  What are you guys talking about, I loved it! It was soo moving. Oh, plus it’s just, it’s so different from the stuff you usually hear.  Oh no, I’m not playing tonight.  I can’t follow Ross! It’d be like those bicycle ridding chimps that followed The Beetles. No.  Oh my God, he’s not even appreciated in his own time. I would give anything to not be appreciated in my own time!  Hey! You were really great! You were really, really great!  Well, kinda. Yeah. Yeah.  Yeah, I-I can’t—I mean y’know I was trying to be really y\\'know okay and upbeat about it, I just—I feel so dwarfed by your musical gift. I…  Oh no. No-no-no, don’t do that! How could I live with myself if I knew I was depriving the world of your music.  Does Joey know?  I think maybe, yeah.  Yeah! No, that’s right. And I thought it was a really good idea.  Oh my God, he’s lost it. He’s totally lost it.  After that? Yeah! No, I mean if I can help.  Yeah.  Hey!  Hey oh, Rach wait! Do you want to go to a movie tonight?  What is this? What’s going on?  Joey’s!  Sure!  Okay, it just seems pretty wild and you’re so—y’know so…vanilla.  Yeah.  To Ross.  Okay! All right! Yeah! ‘Cause I just can’t picture it.  Of course! Yeah, I was uh, umm Thigh Mega Tampon.  Yeah! Y’know, we were really huge too, but then they had to shut us down when Regina Philange died of alcohol poisoning.  Really?!  Oh, somewhere Joey’s head is exploding.  Rachel, it’s okay. You don’t have to do this. I believe you. All right? Okay, if-if you say that you kissed Melissa, then you kissed Melissa.  I know.  I just wanted to see what all the fuss was about.  I’ve had better.  Excuse me.  Oh, yeah! You like ‘em? I just, I went to a used clothes store and got a bunch of maternity stuff. These are sooo comfortable!  What?  I don’t know! How are the-the-the-the, y’know—You’re clothes aren’t funny.  Boy! I didn’t see that coming!  That’s too hard. Too hard!  Hey, so? Are you gonna do it?  Or you could end up with everything.  Ooh, this is so exciting! Ooh, God, what are you going to bet?  Okay. Umm, ooh, ooh—oh, I have a game!  This is great!  Oh, well, it doesn’t have a name—oh, okay, Phoebeball! No, it doesn’t have a name. Umm, okay, Monica, what is your favourite thing about trees?  Good! Good! Five points!  All right, Joey, same question.  Ooh, three points. Both fine answers, but we were looking for leafy, leafy.  Oh, I have cards!  That’s so funny to think if you’d just done that right after the last contest, no one would have had to move at all.  Hey!  What? Oh, are you pregnant too?!  Oh, ok, you know what I don\\'t get? The way guys can do so many mean things, and then not even care.  You know, if you want, I\\'ll do it with you.  No, I mean you break up with Janice and I\\'ll break up with Tony.  Yeah, I know, he\\'s sweet, but it\\'s just not fun anymore, you know? I don\\'t know if it\\'s me, or his hunger strike, or, I don\\'t know.  Are you gonna go over there?  This is nice. We never do anything just the two of us.  Eww, I don\\'t wanna do that.  Ok, have a good break-up.  Yeah, it was really hard.  Ok, you weren\\'t there.  Ok, you can do this. It\\'s just like pulling off a Band-aid. Just do it really fast, and then the wound is exposed.  Chandler, easy, easy. Go to your happy place. La la la la la la la.  All right.  Wait here. Breathe.  It\\'s like a gift.  Oh, I\\'d like that.  Hey, how\\'d it go?  Oh, he needed some time to grieve.  That oughta do it.  Hey!  Sure!  Well, I can\\'t give you a massage, because my licence has been revoked again!  Well, it was an accident...You know, it\\'s a lot of oil and sometimes the hand just slips!  Oh no!You guys aren\\'t supposed to get divorced for 7 years!  Oh, good!Ok, good for you!Try to recapture the magic!  And tell them that in 2 weeks I will once again be a masseuse in good standing!  Well, you said that you had customers lined up in the street, so I am here to entertain!  Yeah! It really has been great too, you know, some of this people must have seen me play before because they were requesting a bunch of my songs! Yeah, \"You suck\" and \"shut up and go home\".  Yeah.  But what?  Hey!  Right, yeah, ok, I\\'ll ask the butler to fetch my diamonds out of the vault.  My songs aren\\'t good enough for your restaurant?  Then what\\'s wrong with them? Would they not go with your tiny portions of pretentious food?  Well...it\\'s not about quality.  Well at least all my songs don\\'t taste like garlic. Yeah, there are other ingredients Monica.  Ear plugs, or cloves of garlic?  What are people having, the garlic Martini?  You\\'d better get back in that kitchen Monica, the garlic is not gonna overuse itself.  Why? The only person my playing is bothering is you!  Ok, well, who identified the tone of this restaurant as pretentious comma garlicky?  Yeah! As long as it\\'s free! Food here is ridiculously over-p...  I can\\'t believe two cows made the ultimate sacrifice so you guys could watch TV with your feet up.  Hey cool, mine too.  OK, I can be a waitress, I can be a waitress.  I can be a waitress. OK watch this. Um, gimme two number ones, 86 the bacon, one Adam and Eve on a raft and rick\\'em, la-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la.  It\\'s James Bond.  You are so smitten.  Oh, you are so much the smitten kitten. You should ask him out.  So. You two are totally into each other.  OK, so what, you\\'re just never gonna see him again?  Didn\\'t you like, just get your eyes checked?  We have got to get you lazy boys out of these chairs.  You know you should go outside and be with the three-dimensional people.  You guys are so pathetic, I, oh, OH, XANADU! OH.  You\\'re not the only one who has a date tonight.  Oh you are so lucky.  Oh, right! Your adoption interview!  What are you gonna name the baby?  Hey!  Oh, that\\'s Sarah. No, no. Don\\'t you get any ideas, ok? No, I\\'m not setting you up with any more of my friends!  Because you\\'ll date her once, sleep with her and then forget she exists!  Mandy.  No.  Fine, I\\'ll give you her number.  SARAH!  Well, you know, if you want fashion help, Rachel and I are going shopping tomorrow. You\\'re more than welcome to come with us, right?  Hey!  Oh, my friend Sarah had a great time last night.  Yeah! So you\\'re gonna call this one back?  What are you talking about? Sarah\\'s great!  That’s it? That’s why you won’t go out with her again? So, she took some fries, big deal!  What?  I’m sorry, I can’t believe I set you up with such a MONSTER!  Thank God you’re here. Listen to this!  Joey and my friend were out last night and having dinner and she reaches over and takes a few of his fries...  What? You know about the plate thing?  Well, I still think that it’s a stupid reason not to call someone again. You are calling her! And if you need to, just get an extra plate of fries for the table!  Wow!  Yeah!  What? They will be!  Yeah, yeah but I am not sure about some of the bra\\'s I got.  Oh! okay. Wait, are we in Joey\\'s imagination?  oh, well, Ross probably has it, you can get it from him later.  Oh come on, they can be in the same room.  Why? What happened now?  Wait. Why was he yelling at her? He’s the one who slept with someone else.  Whoa!! He is soo unreasonable! God, although I think I understand what he means. Oh my God, this is like 60 Minutes, okay, when, when, at first you’re really mad at that pharmaceutical company for making the drug and then y\\'know you just feel bad for the people because they needed to make their hair grow.  Y\\'know I had a dream where Ross and Rachel were still together, they never broke up. And we were all just like hanging out, and everyone was happy....  Yeah, and nobody slept with that Xerox girl.  Okay, your highness.  No, it’s just that he got this new like home theater dealie, and he wants y\\'know, us to check it out.  Ohhh boy, do I feel bad.  Chandler what are you doing?!  Why would you start again after chewing all that quitting gum?  Him? Him, Ross?  Wait. Really?! ‘Cause mine get me out of tickets.  Y\\'know what, I can stay, I’m gonna stay. ‘Cause the last time I went skiing I was to afraid to jump off the chair lift, I just went around and around.  Chandler!!  What does the sign say?  No, the ‘No Smoking’ sign. There’s no smoking in my Grandmother’s cab.  Please!  Okay, Monica’s are the biggest.  All right, forget it, nevermind, you can have mine.  Yeah, this has happened before.  Yep. Put more gas in.  Yeah, what town are we near?  But if...  Oh good, oh Joey and Chandler are back.  I ate a bug.  Listen Ross, we ran out of gas, and we don’t know where we are, so we can’t get a tow truck.  Yes, please.  Oh, it’s Ross on one of his drives!  Hi!  Y\\'know what, but there is, there is no right or wrong, here.  Okay. Good, all right, let’s get back in the car, ‘cause it’s freezing, and my chest is unsupported.  Maybe we can like go to a movie or something.  Or, or the rodeo!!  Okay!  Bye!!!  Um, not so good. He walked me to the subway and said \\'We should do this again!\\'  Or, or, y\\'know, um, \\'I think we should see other people\\' means \\'Ha, ha, I already am\\'.  Yeah- no- I\\'m just- it\\'s, I haven\\'t worked- It\\'s my bank.  It\\'s nothing, it\\'s just- Okay. I\\'m going through my mail, and I open up their monthly, you know, STATEMENT-  - and there\\'s five hundred extra dollars in my account.  Yes, \\'cause now I have to go down there, and deal with them.  It\\'s not mine, I didn\\'t earn it, if I kept it, it would be like stealing.  Okay. Okay, let\\'s say I bought a really great pair of shoes. Do you know what I\\'d hear, with every step I took? \\'Not-mine. Not-mine. Not-mine.\\' And even if I was happy, okay, and, and skipping- \\'Not-not-mine, not-not-mine, not-not-mine, not-not-mine\\'...  Okay. I\\'d- just- I\\'d never be able to enjoy it. It would be like this giant karmic debt.  Oh, I can\\'t believe you! You\\'ve been so good, for three years!  Oh, no! I- I can\\'t drink this now!  Yes, yes! Like the man in the shoe!  From the nursery rhyme. \\'There was a crooked man, Who had a crooked smile, Who lived in a shoe, For a... while...\\'  Hey, Lizzie.  I brought you alphabet soup.  No, but would you like a thousand dollars and a football phone?  I know.  No, I want you to have it. I don\\'t want it.  Oh, that\\'s fine, no.  No. \\'Cause you need that. No, it\\'s okay, thanks.  Okay, alright, you buy me a soda, and then we\\'re even. Okay?  Okay.  No, I\\'m fine.  Huh!  I know! I know, I opened it up and there it was, just floating in there, like this tiny little hitch-hiker!  Does, um, anyone wanna see?  Yeah, \\'cause otherwise someone might get what they actually ordered.  Does anyone want the rest of this Pop-Tart?  Sorry. ..Y\\'know, those stupid soda people gave me seven thousand dollars for the thumb.  And on my way over here, I stepped in gum. ...What is up with the universe?!  Wait, wait, I\\'m getting a deja vu...no, I\\'m not.  There it is!  Did he mention us?  Oh, yeah, he clipped on, he said call him as soon as you get a chance, he’s at Flimby’s.  Oh, yeah, that’s the word I use when I can’t remember the real thing.  No! Rachel, that’s what they want me to do. My warranty expires tomorrow, if I don’t get through, they’re not gonna fix my crappy, broken phone for free! We cannot let them win! It’s us versus them!  Thanks!  What?! Monica, I’m scared!!  Yeah.  Yes!! Yes!! I’m the next caller! You were gonna have me hang up.  No.  Oh, is the play over?  Nah. I kept myself busy.  No, no, I’m fine, and y’know why? ‘Cause of all the riboflavin.  I’m so, so, so sorry, Joey. I definitely am gonna see you’re play. I swear you’re play is very important to us, thank you for your patience. You’re play is the next play is the next play I’m gonna see.  I do, I believe you.  Yeah, I know. Oh, good thing it’s one of those 801 numbers. Right?  Sorry, I’m so sorry, I will pay you back.  Well, I think I broke it. But that’s all right, here’s the number you can call.  Okay, so when you’re done with your tea I’ll look at your leaves and tell you your fortune.  Oh yeah, I’ve done it for years. I actually stopped because I was so accurate. Y’know, and-and y’know, one of the great joys of life is it’s-it’s wondrous unpredictability. Y’know? And also tea tends to give me the trots.  Uh-hmm. Uh-hmm, who’s next?  Oh hello.  Oh Jim, Jim Nelson I’m Phoebe, Phoebe Buffay. We certainly have been seeing a lot of each other lately.  Isn’t it funny how we kept running into each other? It’s as if someone really wants us to be together.  Oh, witty banter. Well done.  Oh okay, well I’m a masseuse, and I used to work at this place…  I-I-I like, I like parties.  Yeah I guess, a little.  Oh stop it.  Okay. Umm look, you’re coming on a little strong. But I’m going to give you the benefit of the doubt, because it seems the universe really wants to be together. So, why don’t we just start over okay? And you can just tell me about yourself.  Okay.  What?!  Oh my God!  Wow! You do?  Oh there it is.  I know, but that creep that I went on that date with goes to there so I have to find a new one. I also have to find a new video store, a new bank, a new adult bookstore, a new grocery store…  Yeah, we both can. And we both will.  Oh, you didn’t have to come in with me.  Okay.  What?  Oh yeah well, I’m sorry about that too, but what are you going to do?  I-I-I’d love to. Let me just tell my friend.  No. This game is grotesque. Twenty armless guys joined at the waist by a steel bar, forced to play soccer forever. Ahh, hello, human-rights violation.  Why don\\'t you play with your roommate?  Uh oh, ooh, are we not getting along with the new boy?  Maybe that\\'s because you haven\\'t taken the time to get to know him. Let\\'s remedy that, shall we?  Hi, um, I just thought that it would be fun if the three of us had some beers and got to know each other.  Oh good, ok. Oh nooo, I have to go because I\\'m late for my um, Green Eggs and Ham discussion group. Um tonight it\\'s why he would not eat them on a train. Have fun bye.  And a crusty old man said I\\'ll do what I can and the rest of the rats played moroccas. That\\'s it, thanks, good night.  I know.  Oh, this is so nice. Alright I have to make a speech. I just wanna say that of all the guys that Monica has been with, and that is a lot, I like you the best.  Ok.  Oh, ooh, Soap Opera Digest, oh that\\'s one of my favorite digests.  Ok, ok, ok. Ooh, hey \\'new doc on the block, Days of Our Lives\\' Joey Tribbiani.\\' Ooh, cool picture.  Hey is this true, that you write a lot of your own lines?  Ohh, ok, I see what you did there. Aren\\'t you afraid though, that the writers are gonna be kinda mad when they read this?  Why would you kill his fish?  Listen, sorry about your death, that really sucks.  But Joey, you\\'re gonna be fine. You don\\'t need that show, it was just a dumb soap opera.  Yes, I was going to incorporate that. Oh good, here\\'s Monica, she\\'ll have something nice to say.  It\\'s amazing! You better hurry up and fill out an application or I\\'m gonna beat you to it.  CHANDLER AND MONICA!!!!  OH!! MY EYES!!! MY EYES!!!!  NO! THEY\\'RE DOING IT!!!  YOU KNOW?!!!  You mean whenever Monica and Chandler where like y\\'know doing laundry or going grocery shopping or—Oh! All that time Monica spent on the phone with sad Linda from camp!  Oh! Oh, I can\\'t believe it! I mean I think it\\'s great! For him. She might be able to do better.  Okay, so now they know that you know and they don\\'t know that Rachel knows?  Or, we could not tell them we know and have a little fun of our own.  Well y\\'know every time that they say that like they\\'re doing laundry we\\'ll just give them a bunch of laundry to do.  No! You don\\'t have to do anything! Just don\\'t tell them that we know!  Well, you could use your position y\\'know as the roommate.  And then. I would use y\\'know the strongest tool at my disposal. My sexuality.  Okay, watch, learn, and don\\'t eat my cookie.  Hey! Ooh, wow that jacket looks great on you!  Well, if you really wanna know, I\\'m—Oh! I can\\'t tell you this.  Well actually you\\'re the one person I can\\'t tell this too. And the one person I want to the most.  I think it\\'s just y\\'know that I haven\\'t been with a guy in so long and how sometimes you\\'re looking for something and you just don’t even see that it\\'s right there in front of you sipping coffee—Oh no, have I said to much? Well it\\'s just something to think about. I know I will.  But there\\'s a whole table of mini-muffin baskets. Which one did you send?  Yeah, why don\\'t you just find another apartment?  He broke that.  I wouldn\\'t bring that up, it would probably just bum him out.  Eh?  Really?  No!  All right. All right! If he wants a date? He\\'s gonna get a date. All right, I\\'m gonna go in.  So Chandler, I-I\\'d love to come by tonight.  Oh absolutely. Shall we say, around seven?  Good. I\\'m really looking forward to you and me having sexual intercourse.  Okay, Rachel, get me perfume!  Okay.  Good idea!  Oh now, don\\'t give away the farm!  Chandler.  So, here we are. Nervous?  No, I want this to happen.  Thanks! Y\\'know, that when you say things like that it makes me wanna rip that sweater vest right off!  Really?  No. No! It\\'s just y\\'know first, I wanna take off all my clothes and have you rub lotion on me.  He\\'s not backing down. He went to get lotion.  Ooh.  Here it comes. Our first kiss.  And why not?!  You\\'re-you\\'re what?!  I just—I thought you guys were doing it, I didn\\'t know you were in love!  All right, y\\'know forget hypnosis. The way to quit smoking is you have to dance naked in a field of heather, and then bath in the sweat of six healthy young men.  Oh my God!!  Frank! Hi!  What are you doing here?  What happened?  But, also, what happened between you and your Mom?  Your getting married?!  My little brother’s getting married!!  Do I?  Yeah, I do, yeah.  Yeah, isn’t it fantastic?  What, he’s 18.  Yeah, I’m a big surprise.  Wow, kids. Frank, are you sure you’re ready for that?  Oh good! Okay. ‘Cause you were acting like you didn’t.  No-no, oh, I’m fine with the age thing y\\'know, until it starts sticking it’s tongue down my little brother’s throat!  Yes. Not out loud.  Come on, you guys, you have nothing to lose, I have everything to lose. Do you want me to lose everything? Everything?!  Yeah, I know. It’s a real mustard-tastrophe. Can you help me?  Y\\'know what, forget it. It’s ruined.  Or instead, maybe you could just not marry my brother Frank.  Okay. Whoa, sorry. Why were you just like all in the dark?  Oh, yeah, sure. So, how was your day?  What umm, what happened?  Oh no. Did umm, did she say why?  Yeah, yeah, no, I don’t, I don’t know. But, y\\'know what, maybe it’s just all for the best?  Uh, well I can tell you why. It’s, it’s because of me. But, y\\'know what, I only did it because I love you. Okay?  Umm, well I, I kinda had a little chat with Alice, and I sort of made her see why you two shouldn’t be together, y\\'know. And you’re gonna see it to, one day, you really, really will.  Okay.  Okay, but.  Hey, Frank. Look, okay, I know that you think I did like this totally evil thing, but I so didn’t. There’s someone here who can explain this better than I can.  Yeah, but not just that.  None the less.  Good for you!  Oh my God! That guy at the counter is totally checking you out!  Go for it.  I’m just saying, get his number just in case. But no Chandler is in an accident and can’t perform sexually and he would want you to take a lover to satisfy the needs that he can no longer fulfill.  I did, but that was really fun.  Oh hey!  I just like him so much that I just feel like I’ve had 10 drinks today and I’ve only had six.  You sound like a guy.  You’ll have a last kiss.  No. Why?  No that is the last thing you want to do!  Because you’re marrying him!  All right, I’ve never been engaged and I’ve never really been married, but I can only tell you what my mother told me. Whenever you have doubts or fears or anxieties about a relationship, do not communicate them to your husband.  That is correct! Yes, you’re supposed to take all of that stuff and put it in a little box in your mind and then lock it up tight.  Yes!  Rach?  Please, don’t play the music. Just uh one more. LIVE FROM NEW YORK! IT’S SATURDAY NIGHT!!  Hey!  About twenty, a couple people from work who had something else to do.  Well I don’t, I don’t have a mother so often I forget that other people…  I know. I know, what’s her number?  Isn’t it at three?  Oh, I told the stripper to be here at five. That’s good right?  I’m so glad you could make it.  Yeah I know. Isn’t it great? One less person we have to make small talk with.  No look, we’ve apologized twice! I can’t do anymore than that. I know you hate it when people are mad at you but you just have to be okay with it.  For how long?  She can’t hear you.  Well, if you don’t want your mother to move in with you, just tell her.  I have new respect for Chandler. All right everybody! It’s time to open the presents!  How about you less important people, let’s open your presents!  Okay, come on Rach it’s present time! Y’know you’re the glue that’s holding this whole party together. It’s kinda falling apart here.  Okay, this is from your friend at work.  Hey! Why are you all red and sweaty?  Not if you were here.  No, not a thing.  Nothing! You have apologized to her like a million times and she’s been nothing but terrible to you. And don’t forget you just threw her daughter a lovely, albeit slightly boring, shower, and she hasn’t even thanked you for it.  Yeah I mean if you want to say anything to her, I’d tell her off.  Uh-huh!  You were fantastic! I’m so proud of you!  You should be!  You got it!  Hi  Oh, he\\'s at the doctor, he didn\\'t poop the whole time we were there!  Oh, why? What\\'s up?  Oui, bien sur je parle Français! Qu\\'est-ce que tu penses alors?  Sure! Tout le plaisir est pour moi, mon ami.  All right, it seems pretty simple. Your first line is \"My name is Claude\", so, just repeat after me. \"Je m\\'appelle Claude\".  Well, just... let\\'s try it again.  Je m\\'appelle Claude.  Uh. It\\'s not... quite what I\\'m saying.  It does, really?  All right, let just try it again. Really listen.  Oh, mon Dieu!  Hi!  Oh!  Ok. What are you gonna be doing today?  Je m\\'appelle Claude.  Noooo! Ok, maybe if we just break it down. Ok, let\\'s try at one syllable at a time. Ok? So repeat after me. \"je\".  m\\'ap  pelle  Great, ok faster! \"je\"  m\\'ap  pelle  Je m\\'appelle!  Ok, it\\'s too hard, I can\\'t teach you!  Hey Joey.  Listen, I feel really badly about yesterday and I thought about it a lot and, and I know, I was too impatient. SO lets try it again.  Really, can I hear some of it.  How could you possibly think that?  Okay, can you really tapdance?  Archery?  Horseback riding?  You can drink a gallon of milk in 10 seconds?  Come on! You can drink a gallon of milk in 10 seconds?  Ready... GO!  What\\'s your news?  Hey, do you wanna go to dinner tonight?  Oh, I hear divorce bells.  No.  Lowell, is that you?  Good for you!  Excuse me, Ross, old friends catching up…  I\\'m sorry I have friends outside the six of us.  Well, I\\'m not proud of it, but, you know… sometimes when I was living on the street and I needed money for food and stuff I…  Well, ok, I wasn\\'t rich like you guys, ok, I didn\\'t eat gold and have a flying pony… I had a hard life, my mother was killed by a drug dealer…  She was a drug dealer!  Why?  No… actually, you might wanna stay away from Jane street… that\\'s where stabby Joe works.  Okay, I think we have a problem here.  Well, uhm, back in my mugging days, you know, I, uhm, I worked St. Marc\\'s Comics.  Well, a pipe was my weapon of choice and, uhm, pre-teen comic book nerds were my meat.  Well, there was this one kid who had a sticker on his backpack that said-  I know… I mugged Ross!  Hey, how was class?  Nothing, I really wanna know.  You don\\'t have to lie anymore, Ross, I know that it was a fourteen year-old girl.  Yes, it was.  I know, I\\'m sorry, please forgive me. I don\\'t know what to say…  Really? Even more humiliating than…  I just really wanted to apologize again and… and also show you something I think you\\'ll find very exciting.  I can\\'t say, I just thought it was really good… and… maybe would be worth something some day.  Yeah… but you should know, I also have a jar of vaseline and a cat skull in here.  You\\'re welcome. And thank you for \"Science Boy\". I learned a lot from him  Great!  Yeah, sorry boys, this ride\\'s closing.  Oh my God, it\\'s all so elegant! When\\'s the dirty stuff starting?  You know, the strippers, and the guys dancing, and you know, pee-pee\\'s flying about.  Really? So this is... this is my big send off in the married life? Rachel this is the only bachelorette party I\\'m ever gonna have! I\\'ve got a big wad of ones in my purse! Really? I mean, really? It\\'s just tea?  Oh, God!  Rachel?  Are you kidding?  How old is your phonebook?  Oh God no, I don\\'t wanna see him take his clothes off!  This is how I look when I\\'m turned on!  Shocking!  Three hundred dollars, are you kidding?  No, you\\'re not gonna pay him, he didn\\'t do anything!  I don\\'t care. We\\'re not paying you 300 dollars for this.  I\\'m sorry, did you say all man or old man?  You know, it\\'s fine. We\\'ll pay you.  Or you could teach stripping. You know, share your gift, pass the torch.  There you go. Okay, do you think you\\'re gonna be okay?  Your last dance. Do it for us.  Yeah, yeah. He deserves to do the thing he loves one last time.  Oh this is so ho-o-ot!  Oh no, no, no, don\\'t stop!  Why??  Oh...you don\\'t have to go, I have something that will fit you.  I want you to stay.  Why don\\'t you turn them inside ou...  I\\'ll miss you.  Great! Ok...I\\'ll go get the tube top.  Wow, Mike Hannigan...You sure know how to make a girl say \"Hell yeah!\"  I\\'ve always wanted to live with a guy. \"Pick up your socks!\" \"Put down the toilet seat!\" \"No! We\\'re not having sex anymore!\" It\\'s gonna be fun!  Hey you guys! Ok, we\\'ve got great news.  I know it\\'s so exciting! You know I\\'ve never lived with a guy before.  Okay, well you put down the toilet seat.  Uh huh...we\\'re playing you two.  Monica slow down! Ok? I\\'m just excited to be living with him. You know I mean, I don\\'t know, Can I see someday being married to Mike? Sure! Yeah. Y\\'know..I can picture myself walking down the aisle in a wedding dress that highlights my breasts in an obvious yet classy way. But do I want that house in Connecticut...you know..near the good schools where Mike and I can send Sophie and Mike Junior.. Oh my god I do.  I know! I guess I am! Oh my god! Load up the Volvo I want to be a soccer mom!  Yeah! You bet roomy!  China patterns!!!!!  Oh! Alright. Well I think the reason people laugh is becuase it\\'s a play on the word roomy.  Oh no! No no! Not at all. We\\'re just moving in right now. See where it goes.  What do you mean?  Oh. Wow.  Was it really that bad?  Ok, well that\\'s bad. But don\\'t you think it might be different with someone else? Perhaps a blonde who always uses a toilet. Except for once in the ocean.  But it\\'s just...  Oh!  No! I definitely don\\'t wanna get married. No I just wanted to make sure you didn\\'t want to too. Whew! Coz you know when we move in and you start changing your mind there\\'s gonna be hell to pay mister!  Yeah I get that.  Hi  Listen, I wanted to ask you something about marriage.  No...I really wanted to know how you feel about it.  Mike doesn\\'t ever wanna get married.  Never.  I want to, but I just want you to tell me that marriage isn\\'t really that big a deal. You know that I won\\'t, I won\\'t be missing out on anything. That marriage stinks!  That\\'s not how you really feel is it?  Seriously? You divorce-o?  It\\'s ok that\\'s how you feel.  I do love Mike.  Yeah I guess you\\'re right. Yeah thanks. This helped. Thanks.  It\\'s not cooler.  Better.  Oh yeah you were helpful! Yeah, no, thanks you.  What do you mean?  They are awfully boxy...  Uh huh.  Just one last time erm... the marriage thing... there\\'s no wiggle room? None at all?  Right. Except that I do want to get married.  Someday.  I haven\\'t exactly had a normal life and I never really felt I was missing out on anything but it just feels that now it\\'s my turn some of the regular stuff.  Because I just didn\\'t know how much I wanted it. And I love you, and I wanted to live with you.  But I don\\'t think I can! it was ok to move in when I didn\\'t know what was gonna happen, but I can\\'t move in knowing that nothing is ever gonna happen.  Are you gonna change yours?  Me neither. I think I need to be with someone who wants what I want.  I don\\'t want it to end either.  Yeah.  Oh you made it!  Sure! What?  Oh, this is fun.  But y’know what? It just seems that you two belong together.  I know!  Oh, it ate your money?  All right, I’ll see you downstairs then.  All right.  Hi.  Sure! I feel so bad for you; I broke my leg once too.  Oh.  Uh-huh, yeah.  Oh yeah! I-I would like that.  Wait! What?! No!! Elevator!! No!  Oh yay! Great! Okay, what room number is he in?  Hands.  Wait a second, or maybe you can go in first.  No not you, Dr. Drake Remoray. You can ask him questions and see what’s he like. People tell doctors everything.  But lately all the guys I meet seem really nice at first, then they turn out to be the biggest jerks.  What else? What else?  Oh. Ah-uh.  Oh.  Enter Pheebs.  Okay I’ve got one for you, if you had too which one would you rather eat, a seeing eye dog or a talking gorilla?  Relax, it’s not like we’re forking.  Huh. Okay, Mr. Perkazet.  Cliff, do you really believe that a character from a TV show was here in your room?  Okay. Okay. I—Okay umm…this…I-I sent my friend Joey in here to find out stuff about you. Umm y’know, if it helps you came off great. A lot better than I’m coming off right now.  You’re right, that was wrong. I’m sorry. I’m so sorry. It’s just that I liked you so much. Can we just, can we just start over?  Uh Joey, we’re trying to dial down the crazy.  Umm, look we don’t, we don’t really know each other so it would be really easy to just forget about this, but there seems to be something between us. And I don’t know about you but that doesn’t happen to me a lot.  Can we come in?  Hi!  Oh, she’s so beautiful.  Oh, wait a minute it’s not gonna be Baby Girl? I thought that was so original!  Yay!  Is she in there?  Oh!  I just can’t decide who she looks more alike, you or Rachel?  Yeah that’s true. Yeah, you love her. You always have. You have a child together. There is no right answer.  I know. I know. I know. I know, and if you try to make it more you might wreck it.  Wow! Well, if you nail the interview, you\\'ll get it!  You wanna work on your interview skills?  Okay! All right, let\\'s start with the handshake. Hi.  Very good handshake, good wrist action.  Let\\'s just say, I\\'m glad I\\'m not Chandler.  But it\\'s just so unfair that our date has to get cut short just \\'cause some guy shot at a store clerk.  Okay, then maybe I can come too!  \\'Kay, bye!  Oh God!  Oh I just miss him so much!  Yeah, it\\'s weird. I can\\'t help it though he\\'s so sweet, he\\'s like this little puppy dog, y\\'know? But like a really tough one that shots bad guys. Ohh, I just love beginning parts of relationships, y\\'know?! You just like can\\'t keep your hands off each other.  So-so how long did that last for you and Chandler?  Come on, seriously! When did it end?  Okay, you know where you are better than I do. I was just curious.  Oh we can\\'t, we already have plans.  Well, same thing we did all day, hang out at Gary\\'s apartment. He is so amazing, we never left the bedroom. But have fun at the movie.  You\\'re not? Then why did you ask us if we wanted to go?  Yeah!  You tired Chandler?  We did! We violated Section 12 Paragraph 7 of the criminal code!  Ok, right there. That, that\\'s the third sign today. Right there.  No, \\'cause you just said dad and everywhere I go today I keep getting signs telling me to go see my father. Like when I was walking over here and I passed a buffet...which is my father\\'s last name.  And they were serving franks which is his first name minus the s at the end. And there was a rotisserie with spinning chicken.  No because I chickened out the last time when I tried to meet him. So I mean coincidences? I don\\'t think so.  Oh, alright, that\\'s it, now I have to go see him.  Hamburger. McDonald\\'s. Old MacDonald had a farm, my dad is a pharmacist.  Oh God, here we go. For the first time in my life I\\'m gonna say \\'Hi birthfather\\'.  No no no, doggie please. Oh, I do so wanna love all animals, please no.  Are you crazy?  Yeah, I don\\'t know.  I just think that this was a really bad sign, ya know. I mean, like the beast at the threshold, you know. It\\'s just like, I have no family left, ya know. I mean except for my grandmother, you know, but let\\'s face it, she\\'s not gonna be around forever, despite what she says. And I have a sister who I\\'ve barely spoken to since we like shared a womb. I don\\'t know, this is my real father and I just, I want things to be like just right.  Ok, thanks. Sorry, again  Ok, I talked to the vet, people are so nice upstate. Anyway, he said that the little fella\\'s gonna be ok and I can pick him up tomorrow.  Yeah, but he did have to have a bunch of stitches and he said that only once in a blue moon does a dog\\'s ear grow back so...still hoping.  I, I don\\'t wanna meet my father over the phone. What am I gonna say, like \\'Hi, I\\'m Phoebe, the daughter you abandoned. Oh, by the way, I broke your dog.\\'  So talk to her.  Hi.  It was an accident, and, and the woman who did this would never ever hurt a dog on purpose. She\\'s a vegetarian.  Yeah, eight of them. That\\'s 56 to him. You know also, if, if it\\'s raining, you can\\'t let him look up too long \\'cause that cone\\'ll fill up really really fast.  Sure, oh, is, is Frank home.  Just from a, from a long time ago. Is he here?  Oh, ok, um, I mean Frank senior.  Ok so will he be back soon?  Alright, I\\'m, I\\'m gonna go. I\\'m sorry about the dog, everything. I\\'m sorry.  Um well I don\\'t really. Just genetically. He\\'s kinda my dad too.  Yeah. So um, did he ever talk about me, Phoebe?  Oh.  Stilts?  Wow.  I don\\'t know what to do with that.  Yeah.  I\\'m not gonna. But you know what\\'s cool though? Ok, if you had a friend named Pete, then I could say, \\'Oh yeah, I know Pete, he\\'s friends with my brother.\\'  That\\'ll work too.  Yeah, that\\'d be ok.  Ok, I\\'m in the book.  Alright. So um, stilts huh?  Ok.  Hey nice boobs.  Wow, Joey and a professor! Can you imagine if they had kids and if the kids got her intelligence and Joey\\'s raw sexual magnetism... Oh, those nerds will get laaaaaid!  I bought them off Ebay! They used to belong to the late Shania Twain.  No, you can\\'t go there! You know how I feel about these \"big massage places\"! They\\'re putting people like me out of business!  Ok, this is not about the MONEY, ok? It\\'s about... it\\'s about corporate greed destroying our hearts and leaving us... the hollow shells.  Well, do you care about friendship?  I feel really strongly about this, Rachel. Please, don\\'t use this gift certificate. I\\'m asking you as a friend.  Promise?  But that woman can\\'t know I work here. She\\'s a friend of mine and I made this big stink about how awful this massage chains are.  \\'Cause it\\'s good money! But that doesn\\'t change the fact that this is an evil blood sucking corporate machine!  Okay, then I\\'m Swedish...  It\\'s a normal Swedish name... Ikea...  Ja!  Is something wrong?  Oh, Ja! Ja!  Uhu, uhu... and why do you think that is?  Or... maybe she has trouble loosening your knots because you\\'re such a high maintenance tight ass!  You know it\\'s me?  How can you come here?  I don\\'t have to tell you everything!  Tips not included.  Because I was ashamed ok? I sold out for the cash! And then they give me benefits like medical, and dental, and a 401K. But you know... you pay a price. Now I\\'m this Corporate stooge and punching a clock and Ugh! paying taxes!  You know what? You are right. I am gonna quit. It\\'s time I took my life back!  Ok.  Hey you guys! Chandler\\'s coming and he says he has, like, this incredible news, so when he gets here, we could all act like, you know...  Never mind. But it was going to be really good.  So was it a lot more money?  Well, he wants to do some ecclectic, so he\\'s looking for someone who can, you know, create the entire menu.  Where are you going, Mr. Suity-Man?  Ooh! Brian\\'s Song!  Oh, is this the bug lady?  That\\'s so great! \\'Cause you already know how to do that!  Ten dollars an hour for what?  Oh! You have a window!  Oh look! That guy\\'s peeing!  Smoked a joint? You know, lit a bone? Weed? Hemp? Ganja?  Yeah! You know all those yummy noises? I wasn\\'t faking.  You guys wanna try and catch a late movie or something?  Oh ok, Ryan, that guy I went out with, who\\'s in the Navy.  Yeah, I met him when I was playing guitar in Washington Square Park. Ryan threw in salt water taffy \\'cause he didn\\'t have any change.  No. No, he is my submaring guy. He resurfaces like every couple years and we have the most amazing three days together. Only this time he\\'s coming for two weeks. Two whole weeks, which means yay.  I, I, I\\'m hideous.  Come in.  Hey Ryan, what\\'s up?  Well, no no, you have to stay back. I, I have the pox.  Chicken. Which is so ironic considering I\\'m a vegetarian.  \\'Cause my, my grandmother\\'s never had chicken pox. Please, please tell me you have, \\'cause oh my God, I forgot how cute you are.  Ohh, ohh.  Yeah, or you know, you could just wish that I didn\\'t have them now.  Nope. You don\\'t want to see a face covered with pox.  I hate this. \\'Cause I tell you, I had the most amazing two weeks planned for us, and almost everything I had in mind, we had to be a lot closer than this.  Ok, this is the most romantic disease I\\'ve ever had.  That you don\\'t stop talking about it.  No. This is what I do for luck, ok.  No.  Give it.  Now do me, do my back. Oh come on, harder.  Can I please take these off? I swear I won\\'t scratch.  It\\'s such a shame you can\\'t see which finger I\\'m holding up.  What?  Oh.  Ok, I\\'ll walk you out.  Well, I never call me.  Oh... Milwaukee.  Oh, Rachel.  About what?  What surprise party?  Well, he didn\\'t tell me.  This is so typical. I\\'m always the last one to know everything.  Oh, poor little Tooty is scared to death. We should find his owner.  Wait a minute. What\\'s his name?  Alright. I looked all over the building and I couldn\\'t find the kitty anywhere.  Ah! Well! There you go! Last to know again! And I\\'m guessing... since nobody told me... this is Paolo.  Thanks.  What? What happened to the window in the attic?!  I can’t believe I still don’t know what happened to the window in the attic!  Ugh, I hate this year!  Well okay, it’s already February and I’ve only given two massages and they were both the worst tippers in the world!  Oh that’s right!  Oh yeah, like you never called!  Okay, I can do that! Oh, by the way, I love my office.  Umm, okay I would like to talk to you about your toner needs.  Oh well, all right…um, no offense, but you were kind of rude.  Oh.  I’m hearing what you’re saying, but at our prices everyone needs toner.  May I ask why?  I surely do!  No-no wait-wait! I can’t just let you hang up! Just please talk to me.  Yeah! Now, why do you want to kill yourself?  Chandler?  No look, I-I’m sure that people know you exist!  Wait, what was that? That sounded like someone being nice to you.  All right so Earl, let’s just forget about the people at the office, okay? There-there’s gotta be someone else in your life worth sticking around for! What about-what about your family, your friends, or maybe your girlfriend?  Oh sorry, boyfriend!  No, whatever! Anything!  Yeah, he’s gotta go.  No! I’m not finished yet! Don’t! Don’t you dare hang up on me!!!  Umm, look it, you-you can’t kill yourself.  No-no I can’t! I can’t let you do it!  Because it was fate that made me call you today!  No! Think about it okay? This isn’t even my regular job! Okay? And my first day on the job, you’re my first call! And-and somebody else might’ve hung up on you, but I wouldn’t do that because I know about this stuff. My mom killed herself.  Yes.  I’m not gonna give you tips! Look don’t you see that this-this…this all came together so that I could stop you from doing this.  No, it’s fate!  Oh. Well umm, okay here’s a weird thing. My mother was also a supply manager.  Oh my God! So was she! And! Get this, okay? Your-your name is Earl, right? Her name was Pearl, P-Earl.  Well, y’know I’m wearing layers and it’s warm.  But if—no look, okay. These jerks might not care about you, but the universe does! And that says a lot!  Hey Mike, what\\'s the capital of Peru?  No. It starts with a \"v\" and ends with an \"x\". Helpfully with a \"to\" in the middle.  What?  Well not so much a pet as, you know, an occasional visitor who I put food out for, you know. Kinda like Santa. Except Santa doesn\\'t poop on the plate of cookies.  What are those?  OK, fine, if it means that much to you I\\'ll get rid of Bob.  Hey Mikey  What are you doing?  To kill Bob??  No, Mike, I don\\'t want to kill him! I thought we were just gonna capture him and, and you know, set him free in the country side where he can maybe meet a friendly possom and a wisecracking owl.  I don\\'t know, I kinda like Bob for a girl.  Oh my god, we killed Bob!  Be careful, be careful! These are my rat babies!  I had to bring them! We killed their mother, they\\'re our responsibility now. You know, they require constant care. You should know that, Rachel, you\\'re a mother.  No! Seven rats! I think we should take them home, we need feed them.  Ok, ok, you start preparing the formula and I start changing the box and then we gotta put them straight to bed.  Well, you know what, they\\'re our responsibility now.  Mate? They\\'re all brothers and sisters.  Yeah, ok. I guess you\\'re right. Allright, so we should just give them away. But to nice families, with children, and reduced fat wheat thins. They\\'re Bob\\'s favorites.  You must think I\\'m crazy.  Listen, I think I\\'ve left something here.  What am I sitting on?  Umm, Wethering Heights. I\\'m taking a literature class at the New School and I have to finish it for the first session tomorrow.  Yeah! Well, I really liked that Lamaze class I took! Y\\'know and this time I thought I\\'d go for something, y\\'know a little more intellectual, with a less painful final exam.  Yeah! Ooh, you should come with me! Oh yeah, then I\\'d have someone to sit with!  Yeah! Okay—ooh, but are you going to have time to read it?  This is going to be so much fun! Okay-shhh, I have to finish.  Okay, look you wanna hold onto your food? You gotta scare people off. I learned that living on the street.  Someday I\\'ll, tell you about the time I stabbed the cop.  Well, he stabbed me first!!  Okay.  I thought you said you read it in high school.  Okay, umm, it\\'s this tragic love story between Cathy and Heathcliff and umm, it takes place on like these really creepy mores in England. Which I think represents the wildness of Heathcliff\\'s character. I totally get symbolism.  Well how would you know?! You didn\\'t even read it!  I think that uh, yours is a question with many answers.  Would you care to venture one?  Are you just repeating what I\\'m saying?  Okay then.  Yeah but why didn\\'t you just say that you didn\\'t read the book?!  Yeah?  Hi!  You didn\\'t read this one either?!  What?  No! You should\\'ve read it yourself!  Fine! Okay, all right, so Jane Eyre, first of all, you\\'d think she\\'s a woman, but she\\'s not. She\\'s a cyborg.  Yeah, this book was light years ahead of its time.  Umm, Rachel and I were just discussing it and she had some very interesting insights.  Well, I snapped! Okay? You weren\\'t taking the class seriously.  Well, yeah! Fun is good, but y\\'know I also wanted to learn. Y\\'know, people are always talking about what they learned in high school and I never went to high school.  All right, wait! Just wait. Everybody just calm down. Okay? Let\\'s give our friend Joey a chance to explain why he\\'s such a big pervert!  What\\'s going on?  So that\\'s why she gave you a naked picture of herself.  I really thought you making a good point. I mean y\\'know, until you got cut off.  I don\\'t know! I didn\\'t come with her!  What are they?  That play?  The movie?  Ohh!  Oh, yeah! Back then y’know, we called the Great War. It really was!  Congratulations!  Go ahead.  Yes! Very good.  Oh my God! Chandler just left though!  Or maybe he-he was writing to tell her that-that he’s changed his name, y’know? Tell Monica I’m sorry.  Oh man.  Okay. Well there’s one down.  Y’know she might not even notice he’s gone.  Yeah, but you’ve got to pull yourself together! Monica can’t see you like this! Then she’ll know something’s wrong!  No-no! I-I…I found one.  Oh here’s a whole bunch.  I know! Monica’s gonna have a baby! Hey, can this count as her something new?  Hey, do you think this is why Chandler took off?  Right.  Yeah, okay. Hey, wait. Do you know what kind of birth control she was using?  Just for the future, this is hardly a commercial for it.  You told them he was missing?  Okay. I’m going with you.  Ross, you’re tired. You’ve been looking all night. And clearly you suck at this.  Okay. Wait, do you know how you’re going to stall her?  All right. Good luck.  He could be in disguise, y’know.  What the hell are you doing?!  Why not?!  But look Chandler, right now, no one has a lower opinion of you than I do. But I totally believe you can do this.  So-so you two were married huh? What happened? You just drift apart?  Oh my God Monica!  Okay. Oh but don’t tell them Monica’s pregnant because, they frown on that.  Okay.  Yeah!  What’s going on?  Oh my God! Why would you play hide and seek with someone you know is a flight risk?!  Hey! Oh!  You know?!  What? You’ll hi-ya?  Well you obviously didn’t see Chucky 3.  What?  Oh and they’re gonna have a baby.  Hey.  What were you modeling for?  You know, the asthma guy was really cute.  Yes, and her boyfriend. But we\\'re celebrating Thanksgiving in December \\'cause he is lunar.  Yeah. Oh, can I come?  Ooh, ooh! Why don\\'t we invite her?  Oh, I believe it. I think the baby can totally hear everything. I can show you. Look, this will seem a little weird, but you put your head inside this turkey, and then we\\'ll all talk, and you\\'ll hear everything we say.  No, we were just laughing. You know, how laughter can be infectious.  Look out, incoming pumpkin pie!  Oh, I\\'m sorry, oh, I just, I thought we could have them whipped and then add some peas and onions.  Well, \\'cause then they\\'d be like my mom used to make them, you know, before she died.  Almost never.  Yeah, but did they have to shoot him down? I mean, that was just mean.  Ooh, ok, that\\'s it. Enough with the keys. No one say keys.  Ooh.  Ugly Naked Guy\\'s taking his turkey out of the oven. Oh my god. He\\'s not alone. Ugly Naked Guy\\'s having Thanksgiving dinner with Ugly Naked Gal.  It\\'s nice that he has someone.  Ooh, you guys have to make a wish.  Come on, you know, Thanksgiving. Ooh, you got the bigger half. What\\'d you wish for?  Oh y’know what’s sadder than this? Bambi. I cried for three days with that movie. No wait two! Because on the third day my mother killed herself so I was partly crying for that.  Oh Chandler!  So that story doesn’t make you cry?  Yeah?  Yeah.  It’s Phoebe! Phoebe!  You’re making one right now!  And-and you’re using my name!  Look, I’m talking right now! You’re—you mean her.  What?!  Hey!  So, I just came from the company Ursula works for.  No! No! I just went to pick up Phoebe Buffay’s checks; there were a lot of them.  Um-mmm, and I won’t have to go there anymore because I gave them my correct address.  Oh no! No! I know how to handle it.  What?  Oooh. Oh, well this is awkward.  Um, yeah, you want Ursula, and I\\'m Phoebe. Twin sisters! Seriously.  Oh, you\\'re not a dingus.  Well, I mean look it\\'s, it\\'s not your fault, you know. I mean this is just what, what she does to guys, okay.  Um, well, get over it. So, I mean you, you just seem to be a really nice guy, you know. Don\\'t be so hard on yourself okay.  Oh, thanks a lot. Do you want to get a cup of coffee?  Hey, oh, you know that guy who\\'s been following me? I talked to him today.  Okay, first I\\'m not crazy. And second, say it don\\'t spray it. Anyway his name is Malcom, and he wasn\\'t following me, I mean he was, but \\'cause he thought I was Ursula, ick. And, that\\'s why, that\\'s why he couldn\\'t just come up and talk to me. \\'Cause of the restraining order.  Ooh! No, no, no, no, he\\'s not like a kook, no. He\\'s just like this, this very passionate, incredibly romantic guy, that got like a tinsy bit carried away, you know. And we just get along really well, and he\\'s so cute.  No, I\\'m just gonna help him, you know, get \\'de-Ursula-ized\\', like you know, like I did for Joey after he went out with her.  Okay, I asked for the news, not the weather.  Oh, great. Great. You\\'re doing great, you know real strong. Going strong. Keep going.  Um, not even a little bit.  Oh, okay then.  Good. So what were you thinking?  Really?  Oh.  Oh, well he\\'s yummy. We did a little kissin\\'.  Oh, no, no, no, no. You know what, he\\'s not into that stuff anymore. He quit for me.  Look, he gave me his night vision goggles and everything.  What, he\\'s not still following her. Do you think he is still following her?  What are you saying I should do?  Thank you, Monica.  Yes? Yes! Oh.  Um, perhaps. Yes! Yes, I\\'m sorry, I\\'m sorry. I was just afraid that you were still hung up on my sister.  Oh well, what do you know, there goes my identical twin sister. Just walkin\\' along looking like me. What, is this just like a freakish coincidence, or did you know she takes this train?  Yeah, just, okay, look I\\'m going. Um, come on. Op, op, behind the pillar, which way am I gonna go?  Oh! Hey, Rach!  Oh, you, too.  Okay.  Oh, Gunther, can I get a scone?  So, how does Mona feel about you and Rachel living together?  Ugh. Come on, Mona, don’t kiss ass.  All right. Oh! Shoot! Oh shoot! Uh, Rachel wanted to see this tape!  It’s a video of my friend giving birth. Could you just bring it back to your apartment?  Yeah. Candy’s the mother, Cookie’s the daughter. The father’s also Cookie. Why am I friends with these people?  Oh, Monica, grow up!  He-hee!  This is the happiest dog in the world. I borrowed him from my friend Wendy. Now, you can only keep him until he cheers you up. And he will cheer you up!  How could you not tell Mona that Rachel is living with you?  Taffy, really? I’ve never had any.  Will you excuse us, we need to talk for a moment.  He’s miserable! What happened to him?  What stuff?  Oh…Joey, you bummed him out! This was the happiest dog in the world, and he spends half a day with you, and look at him!  Okay, I’m going to take him back to Wendy’s.  Ooh, what\\'s going on?  Good for you!  You okay with this?  Talking to Ross.  Well, I think that shirt makes you look like you should work at a Baskin Robbins... Anyway... Hey, isn\\'t Joey\\'s agent Estelle Leonard?  She died.  Yeah, she was just an agent.  Well, we cannot tell Joey about this. He\\'s already flipping out about everything that\\'s changing. This will push him over the edge.  Well, not for a little while. Let\\'s just give him a few days to get used to everything else.  Hey. Everything ok?  Estelle? Why?  I’m guessing she does.  Well, no, no, wait, wait, wait. All right, I gotta go. Just listen. Promise me, that you will wait a minute before you call her.  Man, tough week for Estelle!  Hey Joey, want come with me to… are you ok?  No, that wouldn’t kill her. Ordinary embolism might.  Yeah, I wanted to call and tell you that there\\'s no hard feelings for firing me.  Well, I didn\\'t think I should just drop by...  Anyway, you did what you had to do. I\\'m okay.  That is so cruel! Why? Why would a parent name their child Bethel?  So you guys, I\\'m doing all new material tonight. I have twelve new songs about my mother\\'s suicide, and one about a snowman.  Yeah, you wish!  Oh, oh, good.  Well, c\\'mon, if it\\'s important enough to discuss while I\\'m playing, then I assume it\\'s important enough for everyone else to hear!  Could you speak up please?  David\\'s like, y\\'know, Scientist Guy. He\\'s very methodical.  Me too! Oh! Did you ever see An Officer and a Gentleman?  Well, he\\'s kinda like the guy I went to see that with. Except, except he-he\\'s smarter, and gentler, and sweeter... I just- I just wanna be with him all the time. Day and night, and night and day... and special occasions...  No, no, no, no, no, no. Yeah, could I just?  Okay, alright, I have a question, then.  Um, were you planning on kissing me ever?  Sure.  Oh, David, I, I think you are a sweeping sorta fella. I mean, you\\'re a sweeper! ...trapped inside a physicist\\'s body.  Oh, yeah, oh, I\\'m sure of it. You should just do it, just sweep and throw me.  Oh yeah, right now.  Okay, now you\\'re just kinda tidying.  Oh, hi Max! Hey, do you know everybody?  No, no, he hasn\\'t been around.  Minsk?  I know where Minsk is.  So when, when do you leave?  Hello?  Hi.  So-so you\\'re really not going?  Oh don\\'t do that.  Oh no no.  Oh, but I can\\'t do that-  It\\'s your thing, and-  Okay, um, stay.  Stay.  And then... your face is bloated?  Hi, Max!  Are you alright?  You\\'re going to Minsk.  Oh, you are so going to Minsk. You belong in Minsk. You can\\'t stay here just \\'cause of me.  Everybody looks so happy. I hate that.  I dunno. I don\\'t feel like kissing anyone tonight.  Look everyone, it’s the spirit of Thanksgiving!  Speaking of Christmas, umm since Monica and I are starting a new business and have like no money, umm, this year maybe we could do secret Santa, and then we each only buy one gift. And-and there’s the added mystery of who gets who.  I picked her! Oh thank God you want her! Ooh!  Because she exchanges every gift she ever gets, it’s like impossible to get her something she likes. Come on, let’s trade!  Ohh.  You don’t have to do that, Ross and Joey aren’t here, you can watch the parade if you want.  God, what happened?!  Open it up, let me see.  Ooh, God it looks bad.  Honey, you’ve got to go. What’s his office number?  Yes! She’s very excited about that.  Okay, get out of my kitchen!  All right I… I gotta call my mom and ask her a left handed cooking question.  Yeah, I can see where I’d be your best shot but, no. I’m sorry, but I think it’s twisted.  Yeah, but Monica, do you actually want to be in a relationship where you can actually use the phrase, \"That’s not how your dad used to do it.\"  Oh, he-he can’t talk right now.  He’s just trying to show Joey how much he means to him.  They were threefold.  Oh, she sees him! Oh, they’re hugging!  Oh, there they are!  All right, get a room.  Yeah?  He’s awfully short and I think he’s talking to himself. And to be completely honest, he’s not that good in bed.  Wait a second! This is about the fourth month of your pregnancy, right?  This is completely normal, around the fourth month your hormones start going crazy.  Oh absolutely yeah! Oh and keep in mind, now, I was carrying triplets so in, y’know, medical terms I was-I was thrice as randy.  Yeah. Yeah, I remember trying to steal a cardboard cutout of Evander Holyfield from a Foot Locker.  Yeah.  Yeah. Yeah, that’s what you need a good…pill.  Bye.  Wait, I’m-I’m sorry. What’s the big deal about a holiday card?  Oh hey! So, how did your doctor’s appointment go?  Oh my God.  Okay, remember that little problem I was having during my fourth month of pregnancy?  You wish.  Oh yeah? Come and get it.  Ugh! Women!  Give her a key to your apartment.  No, we hate that.  Hi! Okay, Monica, Rachel, this is my friend Roger.  Umm, he’s here to have sex with you.  You’re welcome.  It’s okay, he’s a virgin.  Yeah, okay let’s leave these two alone.  Hey, are you going to find out the sex of the baby?  Are you two talking about the same baby? Hey! Have you started off thinking of names yet?  Me too!  Uh huh! If it’s a girl, Phoebe, and if it’s a boy, Phoebo!  Yeah, by Sandrine.  How-how about you each get five vetoes?  I know her! I bought homemade soap from her at a Dead show!  Is it me, or is veto starting to sound really good?  Oh, hey, Monica, I brought back your iron.  Uh-huh.  Oh, just as well, I broke this one.  What?  Okay.  Fine.  Then it’s really too bad that you can’t tell me.  Well, then tell him to stop staring!  Really?! Joey?! You don’t say.  I don’t know, I don’t know, I don’t know. You know, I mean, on the one hand, Mother may I? But y’know on the other hand… No. No, I can’t. We’re friends. No, oh, no. I don’t want to risk what we have.  Sure, yeah. I mean, it’s Joey. I don’t want him to get hurt. Well, I must say, I am on fire! First Chandler, now Joey!  Sure.  Hey.  Umm, Joey, I know.  I knooow.  I know about your feelings.  Yes, and I’m sorry. I-I know things worked out for Chandler and Monica, but that’s very rare.  For God sakes, it’s Rachel!  Yeah.  Joey, I just think you’re getting worked up over nothing. This is probably just a crush.  Absolutely! Y’know, you get this rush of feelings, but then it goes away.  That’s right, there you go! Crushes happen all the time! I know I’ve had them for all you guys. Well, except for Ross and Chandler. And I’m sure you’ve had them for us.  Hi, Bubbles. Manly. Well, I just thought I would drop by and let you know how it went with Joey.  Well, you were wrong, he doesn’t like me!  Yeah! How would you like it if I sent you to Lee Majors’ house and told you that he liked you, and you went down there and you found out that he didn’t like you? How would you feel?  Really? Lee Majors is hot!  We’re in the bathroom!  Tell us what?  Joey, can I have a sip of your coffee and a bite of your muffin?  I\\'m sorry, it\\'s just, I\\'m a little short on cash.  Oh no, no, no. I learned never to borrow money from friends. No, that\\'s why Richard Dreyfuss and I don\\'t speak anymore.  You could do that?  Oh my god, I\\'m gonna be on TV!  Oh, really?  Wow! Hey, why are you all dressed up?  Joey, look at me! I\\'m a nurse!  Yeah! But I\\'m a little shaky and nervous.  Okay, now. What?  I\\'m sorry, I\\'m sorry, I\\'m sorry. I\\'m just a little nervous.  Okay, that helps.  Hey. So, what did he say?  I\\'m sorry, I can\\'t do this. I\\'m not an actor.  Joey.  Who dies?  Yes, doctor.  Hang in there, Man With Eye Patch, your tray is coming!  Okay, from the top, people!  Joey, listen. I can\\'t do this, it doesn\\'t make any sense. Yesterday I was a nurse, and today I\\'m a waitress at a cafe?  Well, it\\'s not okay, because I gave a very memorable performance as the nurse. And now suddenly I\\'m the waitress? That\\'s gonna confuse my fans.  Uhuh. Because I\\'m a single mother, supporting my two children.  Wait a minute. Dr. Drake Ramoray and I work at the same hospital. Wouldn\\'t I come over to say hi to him?  About what?  And I just wanted a new daddy for Davy and Becky.  Yeah, well, I\\'m very angry at him, because he slept with me and never called me back.  I can\\'t do that. I\\'m an actor. I have a process.  Wait a minute, I see what\\'s happening here. You\\'re threatened.  Yeah, I\\'m so good in this scene that I\\'m stealing focus from you. Well, rise to the challenge Tribianni \\'cause I just raised the bar. Come join me up here!  Okay, okay. If I were omnipotent for a day, I would want, um, world peace, no more hunger, good things for the rain-forest...And bigger boobs!  I got no sleep last night!  My grandmother has this new boyfriend, and they\\'re both kind of insecure in bed. Oh, and deaf. So they\\'re constantly, like, having to reassure each other that they\\'re having a good time. You have no idea how loud they are!  Thanks.  I remember the day I got my first pay check. There was a cave in in one of the mines, and eight people were killed.  I worked in a Dairy Queen, why?  Ooh! Ooh! And I brought Operation! But, um, I lost the tweezers, so we can\\'t operate. But we can prep the guy!  You are just like Jack.  No, Jack and the Beanstalk.  Yeah, right! See, he gave up something, but then he got those magic beans. And then he woke up, and there was this, this big plant outside his window, full of possibilities and stuff.. And he lived in a village, and you live in the Village..  Oh, see, Jack did love the cow.  Floopy?  Oh, like that\\'s a word.  Oh, well... \\'cause.... you just... I don\\'t like this question.  What?  I don\\'t even have a \\'pl\\'.  And-and a power tie?  Big Bird\\'s friend.  Ooh, wait.. wait, I see a woman.  Definitely not his mother.  Yeah?  Uh-huh.  Oh! Oh! Oh! Okay, fine, fine. Now I don\\'t feel so bad about sleeping with Jason Hurley.  You\\'d already broken up.  A couple hours.  There he is! There he is!  Right- where we\\'ve been looking all night!  Ooh, Soap Opera Digest!  What do I smell?  What do I smell?  What do I smell?  What do I smell?  Did I miss it, did I miss it?  I just thought we might be here for awhile. You know, things might get musical.  Thanks, Ross.  Ok.  Oh, look, twins. Hi, guys. Oh, cute, cute.  Hey. Ooh, look at you, dressy-dress.  Hey, hey, ok, all right, that\\'s it! Get in here. Come on. My god, you guys, I don\\'t believe you. There are children coming into the world in this very building and your negative fighting noises are not the first thing they should be hearing. So just stop all the yelling, just stop it!  Don\\'t make me do this again, I don\\'t like my voice like this.  Ok, who wants to hear something ironic?  This is so great.  Well, Susan, I see what appears to be a dark vent. Wait. Yes, it is in fact a dark vent.  Susan, he looks just like you.  Oh, look, he\\'s closing his eyes again.  Well, I left my guitar here again.  Oh.  Okay.  So do you want to hang out or something?  Oh are you and Chandler…  Okay. Do you guys want me to play for you?  You ask an intriguing question Chandler Bing.  Oh my God! You’re getting a massage! You never let me massage you!!  You told me you hate massages!  I can’t believe this! How long as this been going on?  Oh, it has a name?  Why won’t you let me massage you?  Monica! We lived together for years! I’ve seen you naked!  I’m curious about the human body.  But I’m a professional! And I’m really good! Look, if you’re uncomfortable we can stop. Just give me a chance, okay. Please?  It does! How would you feel if you couldn’t share your cooking? Or-or imagine how Ross would feel if he couldn’t teach us about dragons.  Potato, potaato.  Stating the obvious, but thank you. And it’s not weird is it.  That’s right, you just enjoy.  Hey.  No-no, I got that.  Okay. Okay but you should know though, I’ve raised my rates to $200 an hour.  I mean $500.  600.  Oh, you make sex noises when you get massaged!  Yeah, and it really freaked me out! And after a while I even tried to hurt you and it just spurred you on.  No, you can’t let this stop you from getting massages! No look, I have, I have lots of clients that make the same noises you do!  Well not clients, lovers. But let’s just y’know, try it again. Come back and-and we’ll work through it.  Yes.  That’s it. Just relax.  Come on more!  Yeah, you like that don’t you?  You want it there? You take it there baby!  Hey!  I’ve never driven it! Okay? Not once! Okay once. Okay, I drive it all the time.  Ooh, I think I wanna trade circles.  Hey sweetie!  Hey!  Yeah!  I know. They were mine.  No, it’s not! We were just goofing around and I dared him to try them on.  I’m wearing his briefs right now.  I think so too. And that little flap? Great for holding my lipstick.  And! Y’know what Jake says? That women’s underwear is actually more comfortable. And he loves the way the silk feels against his skin.  There is nothing wrong with Jake! Okay? He is all man! I’m thinking even more than you.  I’m just saying that only a man completely secure with his masculinity could walk around in women’s underwear! I don’t think you could ever do that.  Okay whatever.  Hey!  Wow! Nice! Manly and also kind of a slut.  Uh-huh.  Huh.  That’s great Joe!  Uh-huh.  Hmm?  I think it’s important that you do.  Feel better?  Yeah, I understand.  Hey listen let me ask you, do you believe in soul mates?  Okay, good.  Well last night, I met Monica’s.  Yeah, I had a date with this guy, and I swear to God, he is her other half.  Well he’s tall.  He has brown hair.  He works with food!  Obviously, and he’s British.  Yeah? And, he’s-he’s so centered and mature and confident.  Oh, I’m so sorry. Um, and maybe I’m wrong! I but—y’know I’m gonna go out with him again, I’ll find out more.  Well, he may not be my soul mate, but a girl’s gotta eat.  Oh! Hi!  Umm, Chandler, Monica, this is Don.  Nothing! I swear to God I didn’t know you guys would be here! And the good news is you didn’t believe in soul mates. So…  They’re just talking, and y’know what? Just because I think they’re soul mates doesn’t mean anything’s gonna happen.  Yeah?  Don’t worry, we’ll find you someone else.  I’m so sorry.  I don’t know, they both want to live in a house of cheese! I don’t know how you fight that.  His first big kid’s bike, this is so exciting!  I never had a bike of my own.  Well, we didn’t have a lot of money. But the girl across the street had the best bike! It was pink and it had rainbow colored tassels hanging off the handle grips, and-and-and a bell and this big, white wicker basket with those plastic daisies stuck on.  Yeah, and they’ve been coming by all day. They love it!  Sure!  I love it!!  Ohh!! Ohh!! And I love you!  Not that way! But the bike brought you a lot closer!  Okay! Oh my God! My first bike! Thank you for the best present I’ve ever gotten.  Oh hi!  Ohh, uh-huh so much!  Of course!  Why? Why do I have to learn?  What kind of an emergency?  Okay, I would ring the bell to distract him and then I would knock the gun out of his hand with a Chinese throwing star.  You won’t let go?  Swear?!  All right.  Well…  Okay.  Oh! Oh! Oh no!! You swore!  I could’ve been killed I hope you know!  What?! Why?!  All right. If you care enough to make up that load of crap, okay.  I can’t believe it! I did it! I rode a bike! I never thought I’d be able to do that! Thank you Ross.  Hi!  They live on the upper east side on Park Avenue!  So... now... What about with Mike\\'s mom?  I\\'m wearing pantyhose!  Oh, thank you! Oh... Oh my God, you\\'re RICH!  And you... Your home is lovely.  Holy crap!  Oh, try and stop me!  God! God! This is not going well.  Okay, okay, okay, okay... Still sure about me being myself?  So Theodore... I uhm... I can see where Mike gets his good looks from...  Yeah... And that physique! You must work out all the time...  Oh my God, are you okay?  I\\'m so sorry!  I really, really am sorry.  Yes... I\\'m sorry, I\\'ve never met a boyfriends parents before...  Yeah okay... yeah, your mom... okay... She looks nice, I can talk to her.  Yeah... Oh Bitsy, hi. Uhm... listen I just wanted to thank you again for having me here tonight.  Also uhm... I just want you to know what a wonderful man your son is.  Well, and you know, it really is a testament to how he was raised. Especially to you. Because he\\'s very respectful of women.  Are you kidding. He is so considerate of my feelings and... you know I think... you\\'d also like to know that he is a very gentle lover.  ...and then it goes back to the chorus... Smelly cat, Sme-lly ca-t / I-t\\'s not your fau-lt. And that\\'s the end of the song... I realise that you didn\\'t ask to hear it, but uhm... no-one had spoken in seventeen minutes.  Oh, Pervert Parade?  Oh, Ode To A Pubic Hair?  Oh God! Is that veal?  Oh no, no, no, no... That\\'s okay, that\\'s okay... I mean, I\\'m... I am a vegetarian... except for veal... Yeah no, veal I love...  Yeah... The woman you what?  I love you too...  Okay.  ...sprang to his sleigh, to his team gave a whistle;  Oh, I like my job.  Yeah, Chandler why don\\'t you take a walk? This doesn\\'t concern you.  No-no, we do it every year!  No, yeah, we never find them! She\\'s always best at us, that wily... minx.  Oh no, we have to!  Well then, you should look with us.  Ooh ooh, we have a live one!  Ooh, who\\'s it for?  Ahh, toilet seat covers! Is that what you were doing while I was getting gas?  You guuuyys.  Aren\\'t we done with that?  Chandler, your being here is the best Christmas present I could have ever imagined.  Now give me my real gift.  She’s made it pretty clear, it is not going to happen.  Yeah well, we’ll see.  Hey!  Umm, a flea market?  Y’know? Ooh, you can almost smell the opium.  How much was it?  500 bucks at a flea market?!  Oh no.  A dollar?  Ohh, okay, they gave you the old time pricing.  Well, what period is it from?  Yes, yes I do. God, oh it’s just perfect! Wow! I bet it has a great story behind it too. Did they tell you anything? Like y’know where it was from or…  Sure!  You bought your sheets at a flea market? Ross come on, you gotta loosen the purse strings a little.  What?!  Ross, where did you get this?!  Wow! Oh my God, well if they’ve ripped off our table ours must be much more than one and fifty dollars!  Well this doesn’t even smell like opium.  Ah!  Yeah no, I’m telling you Rachel has such a great eye for this stuff. Ross, y’know if you ever decide you need to redecorate—And I think that you should. You should, you should ask Rachel to help.  Oh, come on! I think he’s ready to get rid of, what did you call it? The cheap knock-offs and dinosaur junk.  No! I do want to!  Yeah!  Well at least I got these sheets for Ross.  Uck, look at this! Pottery Barn, yuck!  No! Look-look! There’s the coffee table they stole from us!  That fan kinda looks like ours. And the birdcage and the…wait a sec! This is our exact living room!  Oh my God. This is where you got all our stuff, Pottery Barn! Oh my God!  No-no-no, but I am mad! I am mad! Because this stuff is everything that is wrong with the world! And it’s all sitting up in my living room and all I can think about is how I don’t have that lamp!  I can’t! I can’t! Unless… Well are you saying that-that you would move out if-if I didn’t buy that lamp?  But are you saying that you would move out if I didn’t buy that lamp?  Okay then I don’t have a choice! I have to buy that lamp!  But at least the apothecary table is real.  You name one woman that you broke up with for a real reason.  I miss Janice though. \"Hello, Chandler Bing.\"  Ok, it\\'s very faint, but I can still sense him in the building. Go into the light, Mr. Heckles!  I\\'m sorry, but sometimes they need help. That\\'s fine. Go ahead and scoff. You know, there\\'re a lot of things that I don\\'t believe in, but that doesn\\'t mean they\\'re not true.  Like crop circles, or the Bermuda triangle, or evolution?  Nah. Not really.  I don\\'t know, it\\'s just, you know...monkeys, Darwin, you know, it\\'s a, it\\'s a nice story, I just think it\\'s a little too easy.  Yeah, I just don\\'t buy it.  Ok, don\\'t get me started on gravity.  Well, it\\'s not so much that you know, like I don\\'t believe in it, you know, it\\'s just...I don\\'t know, lately I get the feeling that I\\'m not so much being pulled down as I am being pushed.  Just don\\'t. Look at this funky shirt!  Really? You can actually see it?  See, I didn\\'t know that.  Huh. So now, the real question is, who put those fossils there, and why?  Maybe the overlords needed them to steer their spacecrafts.  Look, can\\'t we just say that you believe in something, and I don\\'t.  What is this obsessive need you have to make everyone agree with you? No, what\\'s that all about? I think, I think maybe it\\'s time you put Ross under the microscope.  He\\'s even kind of cute.  I\\'d call that excessive.  Janice? You called Janice?  Uh-oh. It\\'s Scary Scientist Man.  Ok, look, before you even start, I\\'m not denying evolution, ok, I\\'m just saying that it\\'s one of the possibilities.  Ok, Ross, could you just open your mind like this much, ok? Wasn\\'t there a time when the brightest minds in the world believed that the world was flat? And, up until like what, 50 years ago, you all thought the atom was the smallest thing, until you split it open, and this like, whole mess of crap came out. Now, are you telling me that you are so unbelievably arrogant that you can\\'t admit that there\\'s a teeny tiny possibility that you could be wrong about this?  I can\\'t believe you caved.  You just abandoned your whole belief system. I mean, before, I didn\\'t agree with you, but at least I respected you. How, how, how are you going to go into work tomorrow? How, how are you going to face the other science guys? How, how are you going to face yourself? Oh! That was fun. So who\\'s hungry?  Ok, I didn\\'t see it, because I was putting on my jacket, but I uh want to believe you.  Uh huh. Why is that?  Chandler, you called Janice! That\\'s how much you wanted to be with someone!  You\\'re there!  Hey.  What are you doing?  This is madness. It\\'s madness, I tell you, for the love of God, Monica, don\\'t do it!! ...Thank you.  Lotsa things.  Okay. And, my, dead, mother, says, you, are, it. I\\'m with Rachel.  Hey. We found her, we found the girl.  Popes in a Volkswagen! ...I love that joke.  I\\'d say that chair\\'s taking the brunt.  ...Flame Boy.  Okay. Good-bye, little monkey guy. Alright, I wrote you this poem. Okay, but don\\'t eat it \\'till you get on the plane.  Oh!  Rachel! Come on out! Monica made breakfast!  Yeah, but you shouldn’t compare yourself to me.  Really?! ‘Cause y’know that hurts.  Least of all you.  Because it’s our thirtieth birthday.  Yeah. What?!  Nu-uh!  You have your birth certificate?  Our mom.  Do you have my birth certificate?  I just lost a whole year of my life.  Your middle name is Pamela?  Well, I never knew mine. Do you remember what it is?  That’s my first name.  Hey, what’s going on?  Yay! I love drunk Monica!  Ohh! All right! All right. Here’s what we’ll do, I’ll get twice as drunk as Monica and then no one’s will even notice her.  Oh let me guess, and you wanna have them all at the same time and you wanna have them for your brother.  If you could do that, I’d marry the hippity-hop.  Don’t you see? Everyone’s looking at me! The plan’s working! I didn’t even have to take off my top yet!  I lost a whole year! I can’t believe it! This is so unfair!  Will it? Will it?! I mean, how would you feel if you found out you were 31?  Plus, it totally ruined my schedule! I…I haven’t done any of the things I wanted to do by the time I was 31!  Like okay I-I-I, I haven’t met any Portuguese people! I, I haven’t had the perfect kiss! And I haven’t been to sniper’s school!  Oh yeah.  You did the right thing.  Oh, yeah!  Monica- Hi! Um, Monica, you\\'re scaring me. I mean, you\\'re like, you\\'re like all chaotic and twirly. And not-not in a good way.  Yeah, it\\'s beautiful.  No, look, don\\'t touch that!  Doy! Probably right before she lost it!  She is so great! I miss her.  Y\\'know, it\\'s even worse when you\\'re twins.  Yeah. We don\\'t speak. She\\'s like this high-powered, driven career type.  She\\'s a waitress.  You know, if you tilt your head to the left, and relax your eyes, it kinda looks like an old potato.  Okay!  Hey!  You guys you really should get rid of those animals. They shouldn’t be living in an apartment.  All right. I’m gonna go to the fertility doctor and um, see if I’m ready to have Frank and Alice’s embryo transferred into my uterus.  Oh, they’re just gonna umm, look to see if my endometria layer is thick.  Okay everyone, think thick.  Hi! Wish me luck!  Oh! I knew it! I knew it! I felt really thick this morning.  Embryossss? As in, \"More than one?\"  Five? Okay, where am I giving birth, a hospital or a big box under the stairs?  That’s it! 25 percent? That means that’s it’s like 75 percent chance of no baby at all!  Okay, well y’know what, don’t worry you guys, ‘cause I’m-I’m gonna do this as many times as it takes to get it right.  Wow! You guys really don’t know anything!  Hello, tiny embryos. Well, I’m-I’m Phoebe Buffay, hi! I’m-I’m-I’m hoping to be your uterus for the next nine months. You should know, that we’re doing this for Frank and Alice, who you know, you’ve been there! Umm, y’know they want you so much, so when you guys get in there, really grab on. Okay, and-and I promise that I’ll keep you safe and warm until you’re ready to have them take you home, so… Oh! And also, umm next time you see me, I’m screaming, don’t worry, that’s what’s supposed to happen.  Umm, yeah, uh-huh, they’re implanted.  Well, freaked. ‘Cause it turns out that the odds are really sucky. And! This is Frank and Alice’s like only shot. Like, they are literally putting all of their eggs in my basket.  All right, I’m gonna go take a pregnancy test, right now.  Well the doctor says it takes a couple days, but my body’s always been a little faster than Western medicine.  Nope, not knocked up yet.  Oh. Oh.  All right, I will. No, I will. But umm, y’know just remember that it’s still really early, okay so, if it says that I’m not pregnant, that doesn’t mean that I’m not gonna get pregnant, okay and, and just please, just so I don’t go completely nuts, just try not put all your hopes on this.  You guys! You guys! You’re gonna have a baby! They’re gonna have a baby!  Okay, but this can’t be good for the baby.  Oh, some guy she met at the movies.  Hang in there, it\\'s gonna happen.  Because she\\'s your lobster.  C\\'mon you guys. It\\'s a known fact that lobsters fall in love and mate for life. You know what, you can actually see old lobster couples walkin\\' around their tank, ya know, holding claws like. . .  So, do you have any other possibilities?  What is that sparkly thing?  Do you want a refill?  It\\'s not that bad.  Chandler, Chandler.  I think she\\'s OK.  Do the claws again.  Would you stop already? Get out of the bitter barn and play in the hay.  See, he\\'s her lobster.  Ohhh, wow.  What?! I thought you were crazy about her!  Yep!  Oh my God, that’s so freaky! Turn him off!!  Ooh, hey, could we put on the news? I think it might be raining.  Yeah, I know, I do that ‘cause it makes me look taller.  Well, why are you doing this anyway?  No offence but, y’know sometimes it’s hard to understand you, y’know with the accent, so…  Oh, poor baby.  She’s right! You have to stop!  Now, are you sure you don’t want to go see a doctor?  Have fun. Oh wait, no, don’t! I forgot I am totally against that now.  Really?  Destiny.  Yes.  You keep the old ones in the back, that is so ageist.  So, what happens to the old guys?  Okay but that’s why you have to buy it, so it can fulfil it’s Christmas destiny, otherwise there gonna throw it into the chipper. Tell him, Joey  All right y\\'know what, nevermind! Everyone wants to have a green one! I’m sorry, I’m sorry, I didn’t mean to get so emotional, I guess it’s just the holidays, it’s hard.  Oh, I wasn’t even thinking about that.  This is the worst Christmas ever.  Oh! Oh my God!  You saved them! You guys! Oh God, you’re the best!  Oh, God bless us, everyone.  Hey!  Well, okay, Mike\\'s taking a shower, which by the way there\\'s no law against. And then we\\'re gonna grab some food, so if you want...  Is that Ross?  Sounds like he\\'s with someone.  Oh that tart... floozy... giant...  Yeah, you\\'re right. This is none of our business.  Oh, I\\'m not gonna do this, okay? I\\'m not gonna eavesdrop on my friend.  Get over here!  We\\'ve got shoes being kicked off over here.  That\\'s the door. He\\'s gone...  Shhh... This is the listening side of the wall.  Now, what is this?  Oh no... Have you thought about it how complicated this could get? What about Ross?  Hey, have you guys seen Monica?  Oh yeah, oh, she went to the salon alright...  Who\\'s day just got better? CHANDLER!  Uhm... You know, once we\\'re in the air and the captain turns off the seatbelt sign... you feel free to roam about my cabin...  Aaah... you\\'re not good at this...  No, I think I can come over. It\\'s Saturday, right?  What?  Why not?  You have a... You have a date? With who?  For how long?  Three months? Okay... This is probably none of my business, but uhm, how long do you think you\\'re gonna keep seeing her?  Oh, okay... good. You do that. And then when you get home, maybe there\\'ll be a special delivery package waiting for you.  You know what, we\\'re gonna have sex. Let\\'s just leave it there.  Hi, Mike\\'s place.  Ooh, that was fast.  Yeah, you can\\'t do that! Oh, come on Mike, strap on a pair.Why don\\'t you just tell her that we got back together. You know, women appreciate honesty. We also appreciate gentle spanking once in a while. Just F.Y.I.  Her name is Precious? Is she a purebreed or did you pick her up at the pound?  Okay, bye. Alright, so Mike\\'s on his way over. See, you thought you guys were meeting here, and he thought you were meeting at the restaurant, so you know... Doesn\\'t really matter who\\'s right or wrong. Point is... I\\'m gonna take off.  Alright... Susie, can I call you Susie?  Yeah, I can\\'t say that. uhm... Susie, I\\'m gonna be straight with you... Mike and I are back together... and uhm... unfortunately that effectively ends your relationship with him. And he\\'s very sorry about that and wishes you the best of luck in all your endeavours.  Well, I don\\'t...  Nothing, there\\'s nothing wrong with you.  Damn it woman, pull yourself together! Have some pride, for the love of God.  Okay, not a fan of the tough love.  But he didn\\'t really know, you know. He wasn\\'t planning on coming to Barbados and proposing to me...  Look, Precious... Mike\\'s not worth this. You\\'re an attractive, intelligent woman and let\\'s face it, Mike\\'s kind of a wang. I mean, he proposed to me while he was still seeing you... He was gonna break-up with you on your birthday? And, I don\\'t like to kiss-and-tell, but he cheated on you a lot this weekend.  You\\'re welcome!  All right. I\\'ll do it, I kissed him before I can do it again.  Ooh-oh! Someone\\'s wearing the same clothes they had on last night. Someone get a little action?  All right, stop it, you\\'re freaking me out.  I think my boyfriend ever so dreamy, I wonder what our wedding\\'s gonna be like.  Come on, like you never talk that.  Bye, good luck.  What does she mean by HH?  Are you the cutest?  You know, what I think is so great that you are totally into this person and yet for all you know she could be like 90 years old, or have two heads, or. It could be a guy.  It could be like a big giant guy.  We were just wondering if Chandler\\'s girlfriend is a girl.  Okay, ask her \\'What is her current method of birth control?\\'  Well at least we know she\\'s a woman.  Aren\\'t you gonna answer her, that\\'s like the tenth bing-bong message she sent. She wants to know what\\'s wrong?  Oh, my.  She wants to meet you in person.  What if the husband person is the wrong guy, and you are the right guy. I mean you don\\'t get chances like this all the time, if you don\\'t meet her now, you\\'re gonna be kicking yourself when your 80, which is hard to do, and that\\'s how you break a hip.  Chandler, you gotta stop staring at the door. It\\'s like a watched pot, you know if you keep looking at it then the door is to, never gonna boil. I think what you have to do is try not to...  Well it’s just—it’s one of those situations that I just hate. Y’know? A massage client gave me three tickets to the Helmet-Pelts exhibit at the Morgan Chase museum.  No! No! It’s just that he gave me three tickets and there are six of us!  Okay that’s so generous!  Great! Okay then it’s just us girls!  Yeah.  It’s mostly just photographs of lesbian love scenes interspersed with video games and free sandwiches.  Oh, this is so exciting! You get your picture back up on the wall of fame! Eek!  So umm, now do you have any of Matt Lauer’s clothes here? Maybe? Just ones that haven’t been cleaned yet?  Hey, and then lunch.  Oh wow. What, do you think maybe he’s gonna tell you that he’s gay?  No reason! That would just be a really big surprise, right?  Me too!  I don’t know, I don’t have anyone right now. Y’know?  Don’t feel too sorry for me. At least my boyfriend isn’t gay.  Don’t even get me started on yours!  Yeah?  No! Why?  Well for the regular guy, it’s bad, but Chandler, Oh dear God!  What are you gonna do?  Rachel said that!  Okay, maybe ask this guy.  Well, what did he do?  Joey!  Well, we should go.  So did Heldi show you the place?  I can’t believe you’re gonna ask Monica to marry you!  How can you let him talk to your crotch like that?  Ohh! Okay! Okay, cause when-when he said, \"I can’t wait to hear your first words,\" I thought, \"There’s a trick.\"  Okay.  Hey Ross! Doesn’t Ben go to the Smithfield Day School?  Sting has a son that goes there too!  You knew this and you never said anything?! With all the stupid dinosaur stuff you tell us?!  Sting’s son, seven years old and there’s a picture.  No, it’s New York magazine. It’s an article about the best schools in the city. So how well do you know Sting?  Uh-huh, yeah that’s too bad. I really want to go to his concert Friday night, but it’s totally sold out. I know! Why don’t you meet him and get tickets?! If you get two I’ll take you.  There you go! Oh, you are so lucky! You might actually get to meet Sting tomorrow! That’s why you have kids!  Wow! They’re beautiful!  What?!  Well then get your money back and return them!  Oh no! Why not?  How come?!  Wait! But Ross if they don’t get along then you should smooth things over. Make them be friends.  Sure you can! Give them some blocks, put them in a playpen!  Yes you can! Sting says so himself!  Oh, there you are Ben!  Well, I heard you’re having a problem with one of the boys in your class. And so I thought I would just come down here and sit you both down, have a little talk and make it all okay. Now umm, the boy’s name is Sting’s son.  Now Ben, sometimes people may seem like jerks on the outside, but they have famous fathers.  Yes! Yes you can, I’m looking for Jack’s parents.  Uh-huh, I’m with Ben.  I am one of Ben’s mothers. I’m a lesbian. It was, it was difficult coming out to my parents.  Oh.  Ah! Okay so that would make me Susan.  Yeah! Let’s do that!! That-that sounds good. We should sit down and talk, just me, my lover Carol, and the Stings. Umm, how-how will I get in touch with them?  Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Umm, could-could I get a copy of that? ‘Cause Carol threw it out, she lost ours. She’s such a scatterbrain, but man what a hot piece of ass.  Hi!  Uh-huh.  Why else would I be here?  Yeah.  Umm, I’m sorry. Won’t-won’t Jack’s father be joining us?  Uh-hmm. Okay. Well then, could we reschedule? For say, Friday night perhaps at 8 o’clock?  Concert. Yeah. That does put us in…quite a pickle. Because you see I’m very busy before and after the concert, and he’s obviously busy during.  Unless! Unless umm, okay I-I would be willing to go to the concert, umm, all the while thinking about the children of course.  Oh, thank you. Four would be great.  Oh good! Then you’re in luck! Ben’s not my son!  Oh my God! I do love you! How did you do it?!  Oo, where are the seats?  Okay, now would you say that that’s more than 50 yards away from Sting, his wife, or a member of his family?  Then that’s not breaking the law! I’m there!  Oh, oh! It\\'s on again!  Hey.  Yep, and that\\'s why we don\\'t invite you to play.  That is unfair. I\\'ll call her and tell her it was totally my fault.  Oh, it\\'s your audition from this morning. Can I use the phone again?  It was really fun, I mean I\\'ve never talked on a car phone before.  Oh, I don\\'t know. I mean it was fun one time.  Two?  Okay, I\\'ll do it, but just these three, right  No it\\'s not, sorry.  Oh, Joey! Oh, okay, see I didn\\'t recognize you wearing, in those....pants.  Yes! They called and you didn\\'t get it! Okay, I mean you didn\\'t get it, I\\'m sorry, I\\'m sorry.  But they shouldn\\'t happen, you know what, you\\'re, you\\'re in a terrible, terrible business. Oh God, I don\\'t wanna be the person who makes your face look like that.  Oh, now you\\'re sad and creepy, oh. You know what, I, I\\'m sorry I quit, okay, I just quit.  Not personal, really, well they said that they never met an Italian actor with a worse Italian accent.  Yeah. Ooh God, there\\'s that face again! See I can\\'t do this job! I...  Yeah okay, no if it helps you okay. Yeah.  Okay, so we got some more good rejections, lots of stuff to work on.  Okay, um, oh, the zoo commercial.  No. They said you \\'Weren\\'t believable as a human being.\\' So, you can work on that.  Um, the off-Broadway play people said \\'You were pretty but dumb.\\'  Oh no wait, I\\'m sorry, that\\'s \\'pretty dumb.\\'  Oh.  Yeah, no, I understand.  What?  What’s a Movement class?  Oh my God! How bad was it?  Oh!  Oh, it’s bad. It’s really bad. The only thing in there that isn’t burned is an ass. Which I do not remember buying!  No, not usually. But yeah, I could use one right now.  Yes! I do! All the time! I love them! Oh my God! I did it! It’s me! It’s me! I burned down the house! I burned down the house!  Well no, it was my fault so you should get the nice room.  What’s that smell?  So did you sleep well last night?  Yeah?  Y’know what Joey left on my pillow?  Gum!  Yeah I know, it was my candle. My candle!  I don’t use a curling iron.  Thanks Monica!  What the smell from Joey’s? No, I can hardly smell it over here.  I can smell it a little, bake the pie.  Okay.  Well, not much has changed in the last five minutes.  Oh that’s all right. I’m still full from your homemade potato chips.  That doesn’t lock does it?  Now I know that they said that the umm, the hair straightener started the fire but I think I’m partly at fault. You see, I didn’t, I didn’t tell you but umm, but I-I had recently refilled the tissues and so y’know let’s just face it, that’s just kindling! So I think it’s better that I stay at Joey’s.  Okay. Oh umm, Chandler, Monica is looking for you.  Yeah she said something about crumbies.  No but at Monica’s you can eat cookies over the sink!  Okay, this is inexcusable. I am shocked to my very core!  Another lie. You have a sickness!  What about me? I just found out that Denise is leaving town for a while, I don’t have a roommate.  Maybe you could be my roommate!  Yeah!  Umm, she said she’d be back December 26th.  Na-uh, no, we are all responsible for our own babies.  That sounds really great, but maybe you should be in charge of wiping.  Hey!  I don’t know why I was so nervous about this. And I don’t know why Frank and Alice are always complaining. This is so easy.  No Chandler, they can swallow one of those little parts! And also, look at his smooth area, that’s just gonna mess them up.  What?!  Oh, look at little Leslie stretching in her sleep.  Oh, I can still do that.  How did that happen?!!  Yeah, but only a genius would swallow a sonic blaster gun.  What?! No, you can’t, you can’t leave me here with them! We’re baby-sitting!  But you-you can’t leave me with them! We-we’re a team! We’re playing a zone! They’re gonna triple team me!  But no, because a doctor won’t be able to help him, it’s just gonna y’know naturally pass through his system in like seven years.  I’m pretty sure it’s gun.  Okay, so I totally took care of the babies all by myself! I fed ‘em, bathed ‘em, and put ‘em to bed.  I know, the babies are asleep.  I did it! I took care of the babies all by myself!  Absolutely!  Oh, I have dinner plans with Joey. We get together about once a month to discuss the rest of you guys.  Duly noted.  Joseph Francis Tribbiani are you home yet?!!  Oh that’s a nickname we were trying out.  Oh! Here’s Joseph Francis!  So what?! That doesn’t give you the right to ditch me!  Well, it does.  Okay, you wore me down.  David the scientist guy, David that I was in love with, David who went to Russia and broke my heart David!  Oh, you say someone’s name enough, they turn around.  Well… Yeah. You look great too. Did you get a haircut?  Yeah.  Uh-huh.  Well, of course I would want to see you. I…I think about you all the time.  Really?  Uh-huh.  Yeah.  I can’t. I can’t believe I have plans, I can’t. Can you do it tomorrow night though?  Well, I have plans with Joey tonight.  No he won’t. And that’s not even the point! Monica, I made a whole speech about you do not cancel plans with friends! And now y’know what? Just because, potentially, the love of my life comes back from Russia just for one night, I-I should change my beliefs?! I should change beliefs! No! No! No, if I don’t have my principles, I don’t have anything!  Or! I should rush through dinner with Joey and I can meet David at 9:00!  Hey!  Yes! I will have the green salad, umm the house salad, and water’s fine.  Okay.  Huh?  What?  God Joey, this is taking forever!  W-w—I just—it’s that—I have—y’know I have-I have an appointment. And it’s very important.  Well… It’s a date.  Come on Joey, don’t make me feel badly about this.  That—It’s not the same thing! This is totally different! This is with David! Remember David, the scientist guy? Okay, he’s very special to me.  She was?  Yeah!  Hey!  Oh, I wouldn’t miss this.  Are you sure? I’ll bet there’s another flight to Minsk in like…  That’s really beautiful. What does it mean?  That’s good. I got to admit, I thought it was something else.  You’re right! You’re right. Don’t say it.  Oh right, like they’re gonna let me have a passport.  Hey, what\\'s going on?  Trouble?  Oh, no. Don\\'t you hate it when people aren\\'t there for you?  Hey.  Um you, you got a minute?  So.  Um, oh, I got you a birthday present.  Right, like the kind you...  How\\'d you know I was coming?  I can\\'t believe you did this.  So... What\\'s the deal with umm, you and Joey?  Does he know?  Joey. You know, um, he\\'s really nutsy about you.  You got me.  So, um, are you gonna call him?  No, Joey.  No. No food with a face.  Yeah, you too.  Really?  Is he alright?  Well, what kind of guy are you looking for?  Y’know, this is probably none of my business, but weren’t you guys supposed to not be seen in public together?  Oh, sly.  Okay, I just thought of the perfect guy for Rachel to take to her thing.  Oh that’s good, I guess she’ll have a choice between my guy and your weirdo.  ‘Cause that’s just your taste.  Oh yeah?  A chin dimple!  Have you seen your guy’s body?  Well my guy is spectacular. Okay? He’s a massage client and one time umm, when he was on the table, I looked at it. And I mean all of it.  Oh yeah, like there are police for that!  Oh, Chandler funny?  My guy is well read.  My guy has great teeth!  Hey!  What did you do on yours?  Rachel, what the hell is this?!  You ask us to find you a guy and you come traipsing in here with your own!  Yeah and I-I found you one too who is not a weirdo.  So, Sebastian, do you do any volunteer work?  No reason, it’s just I know a single guy that cares about other people.  Well, so do a lot of people.  Okay sure!  Ooh, technically you owe me $600 for sending out happy thoughts on your last ten auditions.  Okay.  Ross, you can’t tell her not to go. You just started dating.  Nothing, you just have to be cool with it.  This is Patrick.  Yeah, this is the guy I was telling you about.  Yeah. And believe me, this suit does not do justice to what’s underneath it.  Yeah?  Yeah, okay, let’s talk it out.  Then why did she ask us to…  Rachel, we’re sorry for pushing those guys on you.  Oh my God, look! That’s Elizabeth!  Wait, does he eat chalk?  Just, \\'cause, I don\\'t want her to go through what I went through with Carl- oh!  No.  Fine!  Be murky!   If I let go of my hair, my head will fall off.  Ooh, I just pulled out four eyelashes. That can\\'t be good.  Oh, I wish I could, but I don\\'t want to.  Oh no, don\\'t hate, you don\\'t want to put that out into the universe.  Give her a break, it\\'s hard being on your own for the first time.  You\\'re welcome. I remember when I first came to this city. I was fourteen. My mom had just killed herself and my step-dad was back in prison, and I got here, and I didn\\'t know anybody. And I ended up living with this albino guy who was, like, cleaning windshields outside port authority, and then he killed himself, and then I found aromatherapy. So believe me, I know exactly how you feel.  Oh, was I doing it again?  Yeah, I agree. Ya know, I think fancy parties are only fun if you\\'re fancy on the inside and I\\'m just not sure we are.  Why not her?  I\\'m sorry, I didn\\'t know.  Ok, so I guess we don\\'t invite her parents.  Ooh, ooh, did you ask Stacy Roth?  Ok, here are the birthday candles. Where\\'s the birthday cake?  And because you\\'re both, you know, white women.  Listen if you wanna go, just go.  Alright, I can get you out.  Shh. In a minute, I\\'m gonna create a diversion. When I do, walk quickly to the door and don\\'t look back.  Oh no, ooh, ooh, did somebody forget to use a coaster?  Great, I\\'m seeing water rings again.  Ok, ok, she\\'s taking the trash out so I can get you out of here but it has to be now, she\\'ll be back any minute.  No, only the three of you, any more than that and she\\'ll get suspicious.  There isn\\'t time. You must leave everything. They\\'ll take care of you next door.  Everything you\\'ve heard is true.  Alright, I\\'m sorry but these people needed me. They work hard all week, it\\'s Saturday night, they deserve to have a little fun. Go.  Oh all right, then I guess we\\'re going back into the hallway.  Ok Rachel, make a special flan wish.  Why? Just \\'cause you\\'re too lazy to get up off your touchie?  Sure! Where is it?  Ohh! So you\\'re 5639?!  Who was that?  Which Richard?  Richard Simmons?! Oh my God!  Oh! Okay, that actually makes more sense. So how was it?  That is so weird! I had a dream that you\\'d have lunch with Richard.  But again, Simmons. Go on.  Ooh! So now why can\\'t we tell Chandler?  Oh, I can\\'t believe you guys lasted a whole year!  Wow! I owe Rachel 20 bucks!  On a totally different bet.  Awww! Now you\\'re just my annoying friend Chandler.  Okay, I\\'m gonna go too!  Oh please, you are not gonna ditch again like you did with London.  Uh-huh, great story! I\\'m going!  Hey!  Hey, you guys, listen, this weekend we\\'re all gonna go to Las Vegas to surprise Joey! Including me!! You wanna go?!  Of course you can take a couple days off work because this trip includes me!  Oh yeah, so you can walk around naked.  Naked alone time.  Uh-huh! Why do you think it takes me so long to answer the door?  So, so far is this trip to Vegas better or worse than the trip to London?  Okay, London 1…  Why are you dressed as a gladiator?  So you\\'re a gladiator! Wow!  Monica had lunch with Richard.  Noo! But that would\\'ve been so cool!  I love Vegas!  Thanks.  So go fix it! Go find Chandler! He\\'s probably up in your room! Tell him that you\\'re sorry and that you love him.  Hey!  Yeah?  But she just came up here!  I wonder where she is. That is so weird.  Would you stop that! Do you wanna know the first thing she said when she came back from her lunch with Richard? She didn\\'t feel anything for him. She loves you!  Yes! Now, she feels terrible! She really wants to make up! You gotta find her.  You guys are here! Yay!  Whoa, what kind of party was this?  Ugh!  That\\'s like the third time that lady\\'s won on a machine I was playing.  M-M-Mole people?  Oh. What\\'s a lurker?  Kills you?  Ohhh!  How do you know about this?  Dance karate?  Ohh! You made up!  Ohh, get a room.  I know. Use it.  Yeah, from now on everyone you lurk, I\\'m gonna lurk first! You move on to someone else, I\\'m gonna be one step ahead of you, every single time! And then I\\'ll be on your ass every hour of every day \\'til Monday, because that\\'s when I go home. When do you leave?  What time? Maybe we can share a cab!  I won! I won! I finally won!  How about we talk about this over dinner?  No! No, you can\\'t arrest me! No!! I won\\'t go back! I won\\'t go back to that hell hole!!  Oh my God! May I just say that you two gentlemen have the exact same hands! They\\'re identical! Now, I\\'ve never seen anything like that in the business world.  No, you threw out Phoebe. I\\'m Ms. Regina Phalange. Phalange!  Well, I mean, I\\'m not married married, ya know, he\\'s just a friend and he\\'s gay and he\\'s just from Canada and he just needed a green card.  I\\'m sorry Monica but I knew if I told you, you\\'d get really, like, judgemental and you would not approve.  OK, I wasn\\'t in love with him and I was just helping out a friend.  I might have.  Oh, c\\'mon, like you tell me everything.  Oh, I don\\'t know. Umm, how about the fact that the underwear out there on the telephone pole is yours from when you were having sex with Fun Bobby out on the terrace.  You have a third nipple?  Yeah, is there a hair on it?  Um, I\\'m gonna go meet Duncan, he\\'s skating tonight at the Garden, he\\'s in the Capades.  OK, no. For your information I\\'m going to see him so I can put all those feeling behind me. OK, and the reason I\\'m dressed like this is because I think it\\'s nice to look nice for your gay husband.  Hi.  Ta-da.  Hi.  Do I? Thank you, so do you.  Sparkly. So, wow, this is pretty wonerful, huh. Mr. major capades guy. I, I remember when you were just, like, King Friday in Mr. Roger\\'s Ice is Nice.  Yeah, well, ya know, I\\'m kind of spooky that way. Wooo.  OK.  Oh, right, OK. Ole.  So um, so what\\'s up, you came to see me yesterday.  Ohh. . .K. How come?  What?  Huuh.  I, I don\\'t, I don\\'t understand, how can you be straight? I mean, you\\'re, you\\'re so smart and funny and you throw such great Academy Award parties.  So how long have you known?  And um, and there\\'s actually a, a woman?  Oh. Well is she, is she the first that you\\'ve been with?  Sure.  I, I don\\'t know what to say. I mean, you know, you\\'re married to someone for six years and you think you know him and then one day says, \\'Oh, I\\'m not gay.\\'  Why couldn\\'t you have just figured this out six years ago?  So, um, have you told your parents?  So your brother\\'s straigh huh? Seriously.  Since when are you into swing music?  What is your job?  Ooh, is that spelled with a ‘C’ or a ‘K’? Oh my God! It doesn’t matter; they’re both great!  Got it.  Did you find the dress?  What?!  Well just figure out a way to talk him out of it.  Yeah, swing music is so out.  Yeah but the Swing Kings? Y’know they suck so much that people actually die at their concerts—They just stop living.  If you had to, what would you give up, food or sex?  Ross, how about you. What would you give up, sex or food?  Ok, how about... uhm... sex or dinosaurs?  Oh, how cute!  Oh, she looks just like a little doll!  OH! He\\'s having an affair.  You know, I\\'m always right about these things.  Ok, then maybe it\\'ll be, uhm...  Ok. Quick. We gotta find a cab and follow them.  So, should we tell her?  Why? Who’d you seen him with?  TELL ME WHAT YOU KNOW!  Well, look, whatever happens, we’re here for you and we love you.  They went in together. So sorry.  What?  Why do you have a realtor?  So you\\'re gonna move?  Have you thought about what you would be giving up? You can\\'t move out of the city, what if you want Chinese food at 5am? Or a fake Rolex that breaks as soon as it rains or an Asian hooker sent right to your door?  Wha..? Again with the nature, what are you? Beavers?  Yeah, but so is this.  You guys, you know what I just realized? \\'Joker\\' is \\'poker\\' with a \\'J.\\' Coincidence?  Hey, it’s your Thanksgiving too, y\\'know, instead of watching football, you could help.  Oh my God! Monica\\'s gonna totally freak out!  Well, of course it smells really bad. You have your head inside a turkey\\'s ass!  Ok, you guys, I don’t mean to make things worse, but umm, I don’t want to live with Rachel anymore.  You’re just so mean to each other! And I don’t want to end up like that with Rachel. I still like you!  What else?  That’s nice. I like having things to read in the bathroom.  Yeah, you don\\'t wanna live in Westchester. That\\'s like the worst of the Chesters.  Hey will you get me tickets too?  You don\\'t wanna win the lottery?  Oh can I? Vegetarians never get to do the wishbone. It\\'s really not fair either! You know, just because we don\\'t eat the meat doesn\\'t mean we don\\'t like to play with the carcasses!  I hope I win!  One, two, three!  Get a room!  Ok, well, are all the tickets in the bowl?  Uh! The psychic also said that I would be betrayed.  Don\\'t come any closer!  No, what\\'s more important, your friends or money?  Hey Monica, what about your extra tickets?  What a beautiful night to be running around the street, looking for tickets. And the wind sure made it fun.  So, what? Monica, we have the winning ticket! My psychic said I was gonna win, remember?  Well, I bet that was very hard for him to do.  Guys, the drawing is about to start!  I\\'m still looking through mine...  You guys, what was the Powerball number again?  We won.  We won!  Don\\'t tear it.  I know that, but look, we\\'ve got the Powerball number, we\\'ve won 3 dollars!  It\\'s not all mine. We all get 50 cents.  All right, so, so you went to Pete’s...  So Monica, what were you gonna tell us?  No-no-no oh, keep your name, don’t take his name.  Well then definately don’t take his name.  Yeesh, what’d you do about it?  Umm, hey Rach, can I ask you something?  Okay, you can totally say no, but umm, would it be okay with you if I set Ross up on a date?  Umm, my friend, Bonnie. She just always thought Ross was really cute, and now that you two aren’t together, she asked if I could set it up, but if you’re not cool with it...  You remember her from my birthday party two years ago. She’s yeah, like, average height, medium build, bald...  Yeah, she was bald, she’s not now.  I don’t know, I hardly ever say that about people.  Well I’m sorry, I thought you said it was okay.  Well, maybe it won’t work out. Maybe Ross won’t like her personality.  Oh no, Bonnie’s the best!  So Ross, how umm, how did it go with Bonnie?  Ohh, that’s too bad!  Yeah, y\\'know what, there are other fish in the sea.  Okay, I hear you! Are you capable of talking about any thing else?  Okay. Would you rather live in the shirt pocket of a sweaty giant, or inside his shower drain?  Oh no! That really is nothing, she is very sexually aggressive.  You said it was okay!  What?! What-what-what-what-what?!!  Okay, first of all, breathe. Second of all, I don’t get it. Aren’t you the one that decided that you didn’t want to be with Ross?  Well isn’t he your friend? Don’t you want him to be happy?  So?  Oh, we killed them all.  Wait, if that’s his favourite area, why is he being so mean to it?  Yeah Joey that is so gross!  Never mind, I got it.  Of course, yeah!  Ooh, I like cards.  Seriously, I don’t Rachel’s gonna think it’s a good idea.  I would love that job!  Sorry Jill.  And, and then I got uh, these are apartment pants.  Yeah, you never heard of them?  What about, what about when I said y’know about the apartment pants, how dumb was I?  Hey.  Umm, I think there’s something you should maybe know.  No. No. It’s just I was umm, I was with Ross and Jill after you left and umm, I’m pretty sure I saw a little spark between them.  Yeah I mean it’s probably nothing, but I just wanted to warn you that there might be something there.  Yeah!  Yeah.  Yeah.  Okay then.  But great news about the apartment pants, huh?  Hey. Watcha guys doin?  Why are you guys so upset? It\\'s Old Yeller, it\\'s a happy movie.  C\\'mon, happy family gets a dog, frontier fun.  What when Yeller saves saves the family from the wolf and everyone\\'s happy?  Yu-huh. That\\'s when my mother would shut off the TV and say \\'The end\\'.  He doesn\\'t have rabies, he has babies. That\\'s what my mom said.  Hey.  Ok, Love Story, Brian\\'s Song, and Terms of Endearment.  Yeah, I talked to my grandma about the Old Yeller incident, and she told me that my mom used to not show us the ends of sad movies to shield us from the pain and sadness. You know, before she killed herself.  Hey.  Oh, ok, murder, cancer, soccer teams eating each other in the Andes.  Uh huh, what is happening to the world? I mean, no no no, \\'cause ET leaves, and and Rocky loses, Charlotte dies.  With the web, the spider she dies, she does. She has babies and dies. It\\'s like ya know, hey welcome home from the hospital, thud.  Yeah.  It\\'s a Wonderful Life. Yes I\\'ve heard of this.  Please, I almost fell for that with, uh, Pride of the Yankees, I thought I was gonna see a film about Yankee pride and then, boom, the guy gets Lou Gehrig\\'s disease.  Phoebe, just watch that, I promise it will resotre all your faith in humanity.  Sure.  Does it matter? You\\'re ultimately just gonna die or get divorced or have to blow your pets head off.  Hey. Oh thanks for the great movie tip.  Oh yeah. You know, I don\\'t know if I was happier when um George Bailey destroyed the family business or um, Donna Reid cried, or when the mean pharmacist made his ear bleed.  I didn\\'t watch the ending, I was too depressed. It just kept getting worse and worse, it should have been called, \"It\\'s a sucky life and just when you think it can\\'t suck any more it does.\"  Oh, I\\'m so glad you\\'re here.  Oh no, let her stay out there. It’s sweet.  So have you decided on a band for the wedding? Because, y’know, I’m kinda musical.  Well speaking of chiming in, remember the time you burned down my apartment?  Oh, 19! We thought you said 90!  Oh honey no, you ate it all.  If you would’ve let me finish, it goes on to say that he’s probably not gay.  Really?! Oh that’s so exciting! Thank you! Thanks Mon! Oh but Mon, if you touch my guitar again I’ll have to pound on you for a little bit.  You guys kissed!!!!! What does this mean?!! Are you, are you getting back together?! Can I sing at your wedding?  Well yeah, that and Chandler’s problem.  Why?!  Well, I don’t think Monica is gonna take this away.  Would she?  Okay, you said I could sing at your wedding so, I’m just gonna need a small deposit.  Y’know, just some good faith money to hold the date.  Y’know, I don’t really their permission.  Yeah! And if you wanna look 19, then you… You gotta do something about your eyes.  Maybe just 10 minutes for you.  Oh thank you.  Yeah, I’ve discovered that Ross forgot to take his brain medicine, uh, now without it, uh, in the brain of Ross, uh women’s names are interchangeable, through-through no fault of his own.  No, not Phoebe, Dr. Philange. Oh no! You have it too!  Hello?  Hi, so what happened?  Yeah, I know, but I don’t think that means anything.  Hey!  I know you didn’t, I was talking about Monica.  This pregnancy is throwing me all off.  Oh, me too!  Oh right, maybe I’ll just go home.  Well it depends.  On how far along he\\'s in the sex change process!  Your knuckles are kinda hairy too...  Wow! Talking about high maintenance  I\\'m a woman!  Oh before I forget, are you coming to Mike\\'s piano bar tonight?  But everybody sings. It\\'s so much fun! Last time this adorable old man got out there, forgot all of the words, flipped out  Oh! What\\'s the matter? Are you scared? You\\'re afraid I\\'m a better singer? You\\'re afraid I\\'m gonna beat you at singing?  OK fine! Please come and support Mike. You don\\'t have to sing.  While drinking...  Well yes Rachel but you got something so beautiful out there  Oh my god.  It was the end of the party, you were probably ironing wrapping paper.  Wow! Five-month maternity leave, you\\'re back for four days, kiss a co-worker, call in sick, they are lucky to have you!!  \"No time for losers, \\'cause we are the champions of the world...!\" Thank you!  Hi hi...Oh you have got to sing.  But you would have so much fun and you have a really nice voice.  All the time when you\\'re cooking.  Yeah you\\'re always singing \"Yummy yummy yummy, I\\'ve got love in my tummy\"  OK so isn\\'t there a little part of you that wants to get up there?  Just pretend they\\'re not even here! It\\'s OK Monica, when that spotlight hits you it so bright you won\\'t see anyone  Can you totally see through her shirt ?  Every little bit of you!  Mon\\', not that you didn�t sound good, but...  Oh you�ll probably take care of that on your hands.  Yes, she gives the people what they want.  Oh? Isn�t that funny? I didn\\'t see that before, I wouldn\\'t have let her go up again.  What-what’s up?  Really?! I looked into that. Yeah, but, I mean it costs like $60,000 and y’know you can die. And, you would die!  So you guys’ll stay here and hang out with me?  Oooh look! Isn’t this adorable, Ross let Ben address mine!  Hey! Hey, did you get your invitation to Ross’s wedding?  I’m so jealous you’re all going! I can’t believe I never knew that you can’t fly in your third trimester!  Remembered what?  Oh, it\\'s so pretty. This must have cost him a fortune.  See, he\\'s her lobster.  Hey! Umm, well, only okay because I just got back from, from the hospital.  Oh yeah, no-no-no. I\\'m fine. I\\'m okay, but umm, my Grandma sorta died.  It\\'s okay, I mean she had a really incredible life. And it\\'s not like I\\'m never gonna see her again, y\\'know she\\'s gonna visit.  Yeah, her first day on a new spiritual plane and she\\'s gonna come to the coffeehouse!  It\\'s okay. Actually y\\'know what, it\\'s kinda cool. \\'Cause it\\'s like y\\'know, one life ends and another begins.  Well umm, okay we were in the market and she bent down to get some yogurt and she just never came back up again.  It was really sweet. The last thing she said to me was; \"Okay dear, you go get the eggs and I\\'m gonna get the yogurt and we\\'ll meet at the checkout counter.\" And y\\'know what? We will meet at the checkout counter.  It\\'s Phoebe.  Umm, well I sorta have some bad news, can I come in?  Umm, well, umm Grandma died.  No, she just died today! Okay, umm, we\\'re having a memorial service tomorrow.  No you didn\\'t!  Well, lots of people! Look, are you coming to memorial service or not?  Well hello, Mrs. Penella!

So how did you know Francis?  Really?! What\\'s your name?  You\\'re Frank Buffay?  You just said…  But…  Oh my God!  That was my dad!  Uh-huh.  Come on, you saw the way he ran out of here! What do you think? He\\'s gonna stick around and talk to the daughter he abandoned!  Well, I said, I told him y\\'know, that I was the executor person of Francis\\' will and that I needed to talk to him so I\\'m gonna meet him at the coffee house later.  All right, well, I just can\\'t think about that right now. I just wanna say good-bye to my Grandma.  All right, I\\'d better go too. I have to go talk to my dad.  Umm, no, not at first \\'cause I-I don\\'t want to freak him out  Y\\'know it\\'s funny, you\\'d think I\\'d be angry. I mean, you\\'d think I\\'d wanna rip his tiny little head off. Fortunately, I\\'m past it.  All right.  Oh! Get off!! Ow!! Oh, stop it!! Why?! Why are you doing that to me?!  As a masseuse and a human, I\\'m begging you, never do that to anyone!  Umm, thank you for meeting with me.  Okay.  Huh?  Okay, umm, question 2) Umm, did that marriage end A. Happily, B. Medium, or C. In the total abandonment of her and her two children?  Hmm, okay, total abandonment. Okay, reasons for abandonment, A. Top secret government work, B. Amnesia, or C. Or you\\'re just a selfish, irresponsible bad, bad man?  What?!  But you-you-you came to see Lilly?  She\\'s dead.  Well, if she isn\\'t then cremating her was a big mistake.  17 years ago.  Yep, lipstick and a daughter, big day for you!  Yes. Well, that\\'s neither here nor there.  Y\\'know what, it doesn’t matter what you say it\\'s not gonna make a difference anyway, so you can just go.  That\\'s a defense?  You make up songs?  I have a date with this diplomat I met while I was giving free massages outside the UN and, I don’t know where his country is.  Oh!! That’s my new thing. I figure bodies at peace, make peace.  Ick-neck-tree-anis..... There’s a ‘g’ in there.  In your atlas!  Oh.  Oh.  Umm, well he’s very dashing, y\\'know, and umm, very, very sophisticated, and he doesn’t speak any English, but according to his translator, he totally gets me.  What is this?  Oh.  Yeah. But Sergei said it took the Germans six weeks to get all the way across it.  Yeah. Except for, y\\'know when you’re on a date and you’re getting along really great but the guy’s translator keeps getting in the way.  Hey, don’t call him that! His name is Spackel Back Harry!  You didn’t say Boutros Boutros Gali.  Interesting.  Okay, ah, before you get all talky again, umm, could you also please tell Sergei that I really like his suit.  Yeah but, Mischa is so interested in you, that Sergei and I haven’t been able to say two words to each other.  That would be great. Thank you.  Oh, yeah, sure. I just hope you, hope you don’t accidentally suck it up through your nose and choke on it.  Well, tell him, apology accepted.  Excuse me, but umm, isn’t he paying for your dinner?  Plate! Yes, plate.  See, we don’t need them.  Yeah.  Ameri-can.  Ameri-can. Y\\'know it’s a very hard language. Let’s do it again.  Oh hey you guys, I couldn�t get a reservation for the night of my birthday, so we have to do dinner Thursday night instead.  So?  No! It�s my first birthday with a boyfriend, and he has to work. Uch, I get mad at him, but I think it�s a little to soon to show my true colors.  Oh, Rachel!  Oh, yay!  Alright, okay, so we can all go now. That is fun. Hey, you know what? We all haven�t been together the six of us in such a long time.  Wow, so glad I changed. Almost wore my ??? outfit that can�t contain my breasts.  You smoked!  Are you kidding? The woman has the nose of a bloodhound � and the breasts of a Greek goddess.  Where is everyone? They�re forty minutes late.  I�m starving. I know we were coming here tonight, I ate nothing all day.  Yes, they are expected presently. Yeah, yeah um, their arrival is in the offing.  One really does have a stick up one�s ass. Doesn�t one?  No, you can�t go. No-no-no, I can�t hold this table on my own. If they ask me to move, I cave.  Well, I guess they�re not coming. You wanna just order?  Tomato tart and which of the pastas would you recommend?  Both it is, thank you.  You guys are over an hour late. What happened to you two?  And that�s Judy over there at the bar with Emma?  Wher-where have you been?

Well, I think it\\'s great that the medical community is finally trying to help sick hamsters.  Yes, you do. Chandler loves Kathy.  So, I need to write some depressing stuff to go along with my new floozy voice, but nothing that sad has ever really happened to me.  Uh-huh. Oh, yeah, I could write about the time my hair did that \"Woo-hoo\" thing.  Hey.  Hi.  Wow, cute one!  Okay, I wanna be sexy again so I\\'m trying to catch a cold. It should be easy, supposedly they\\'re pretty common.  What?!  Well, how-how-how is that possible? You barely know her!  But, I need your germs! I want my cold back! I miss my sexy voice.  It\\'s okay. How\\'s the soup?  Gunther, kiss me.  See, I-I think that one that Elton John wrote for, um, that guy on Who\\'s The Boss.  Hi Monica!  Oh my God, has she slept at all?  Oh, okay that explains it. I got a call at two in the morning, but all I could hear was, like, this high squeaky sound, so I thought okay its like a mouse or a opossum. But then I realized where would a mouse or a opossum get the money to make the phone call.  Maybe, because you told him not to.  Yeah, oh, Princess Leia and the gold bikini, every guy our age loved that.  Um, um. It\\'s huge. Yeah, that\\'s the moment, when-when, you know she stopped being a princess, and became, like, a woman, you know.  Oh, yeah, um-mm. Oh!  No it\\'s just that I got this new pager and I have it on vibrate. See ya!  All right. No, no, no, not a Richard thing, just put down the glass. And get out!  Well, okay, fine, use my happy place. Okay, I\\'m just gonna, I have to ask that you don\\'t move anything.  Okay, all right, so, your in a meadow, millions of stars in the sky....  All right, there are no questions in the happy place. Okay, just, the warm breeze, and the moonlight flowing through the trees....  All right, betting and wagering of any kind, are, I\\'m sure, not permitted in the happy place. Okay. Just-just, you know, the-the lovely waterfalls, and the, the trickling fountains. And the-the calming sounds of the babbling brook....  Monica, do you want us to take you home?  Oh hey Ross oh I\\'m so glad someone\\'s here could you zip me up?  Thank you. Can you believe no-one between my apartment and here offered to do that for me?  oh umm Mike\\'s picking me up for a date.  oh I dunno I dunno, you know I mean I like him but am I ready to take my grade a loins off the meat market.  yea you know you are a bit of a drama queen.  Oh my god you\\'re right.  well it was awful every time I thought about what you said I started crying.  well you not what you should feel terrible about, this could have been my serious guy he was sweet and smart and funny. Do you know how hard it is to meet a guy like that?  It\\'s open.  What? Wha-wha-wha-did you do ROSS!  WHAT!  WHAT! WHY?  I\\'m not going along with some lie you made Ross, No I\\'m just gonna be honest with him.  ok  .and I said Vicrum you can\\'t just call every time you get lonely you know, you, you gave up that right when you slept with Rachel.  I know but he call\\'s and my heart goes to him. You know that bastard is one smooth talking free lance kite designer.  Oh.  ok I can\\'t do this.  so you don\\'t think I\\'m a total freak  you know maybe this is a wake up call, about your whole dating attitude. Your in your thirty\\'s and you\\'ve never had a serious relationship and you have never been in a long term relationship, here you go from woman to woman, meaningless experience to meaningless experience never even worrying that it doesn\\'t tern into anything serious.  Oh, Ross, Mon, is it okay if I bring someone to your parent’s anniversary party?  Well, his name is Parker and I met him at the drycleaners.  Yeah, he’s really great though. He has this incredible zest for life, and he treats me like a queen, except at night when he treats me like the naughty girl I am.  Hey!  Everybody, this is Parker, Parker this is…  Hey!  I’ll go with you  Were you guys making fun of Parker?  So, he a little enthusiastic, what’s wrong with that?  No, I’m fine. I’m great. I’m with you.  Hm huh, yeah.  No, that’s not necessary.  No, actually I don’t eat…  Why don’t you just try one?  Then you better do it now.  Because I’m going to kill him  You guys were right. He’s just too excited about…everything. I mean I’m all for living life, but this is the Geller’s 35th anniversary. Okay? Let’s call a spade a spade this party stinks.  Are you sure it wasn’t an oyster?  He’s just such a great guy I’m so excited about him.  You think?  You’re right. You’re right, he’s just embracing life. We could all stand to be a little more like Parker. You know what? I am like him! I’m a sunny, positive person.  What’s that now?  Oh look it’s Parker!  Oooh I love it!  Are you kidding? People acting like animals to music. Come on!  Can I get you something to drink? Like a water and Valium?  Oh thank God.  Yeah? I know! I know! Uh huh? Listen why don’t we just um, sit and relax? You know just be with each other. Quietly!  Let’s try something else, let’s play a game.  But, let’s play this one first. And remember whoever talks first loses!  Oh my God! Oh my God!  Wrong? Really? You know the word wrong. Everything isn’t perfect? Everything isn’t magical? Everything isn’t a glow with the light of a million fairies? They were just brake lights, Parker!  You don’t have to put a good spin on everything.  No! I am a positive person. You are like Santa Clause on Prozac, at Disneyland, getting laid!  Much less happy!  Oh weird, Chandler just told us he\\'s got a conference there!  Wait a minute! So when Emily comes you\\'re just, you\\'re not gonna see Rachel anymore?  Yeah that\\'s better than my way.  I know it\\'s le poo right now, but it\\'ll get better.  Hey.  Oh no! Not that guy! He does look like him though.  Ehh!!  Come where?  Okay, but try and get Joey too.  Hey!  Oh hey, Monica, I heard you saw Donald Trump at your convention.  We\\'re so stupid! Do you know what\\'s going on in there? They\\'re trying to take Joey!  The most popular Phoebe in tennis is called the overhand Phoebe. And if you win, you must slap your opponent on the Phoebe and say, \"Hi, Phoebe!\"  Count for what?  Hey!  You guys you really should get rid of those animals. They shouldn’t be living in an apartment.  All right. I’m gonna go to the fertility doctor and um, see if I’m ready to have Frank and Alice’s embryo transferred into my uterus.  Oh, they’re just gonna umm, look to see if my endometria layer is thick.  Okay everyone, think thick.  Hi! Wish me luck!  Oh! I knew it! I knew it! I felt really thick this morning.  Embryossss? As in, \"More than one?\"  Five? Okay, where am I giving birth, a hospital or a big box under the stairs?  That’s it! 25 percent? That means that’s it’s like 75 percent chance of no baby at all!  Okay, well y’know what, don’t worry you guys, ‘cause I’m-I’m gonna do this as many times as it takes to get it right.  Wow! You guys really don’t know anything!  Hello, tiny embryos. Well, I’m-I’m Phoebe Buffay, hi! I’m-I’m-I’m hoping to be your uterus for the next nine months. You should know, that we’re doing this for Frank and Alice, who you know, you’ve been there! Umm, y’know they want you so much, so when you guys get in there, really grab on. Okay, and-and I promise that I’ll keep you safe and warm until you’re ready to have them take you home, so… Oh! And also, umm next time you see me, I’m screaming, don’t worry, that’s what’s supposed to happen.  Umm, yeah, uh-huh, they’re implanted.  Well, freaked. ‘Cause it turns out that the odds are really sucky. And! This is Frank and Alice’s like only shot. Like, they are literally putting all of their eggs in my basket.  All right, I’m gonna go take a pregnancy test, right now.  Well the doctor says it takes a couple days, but my body’s always been a little faster than Western medicine.  Nope, not knocked up yet.  Oh. Oh.  All right, I will. No, I will. But umm, y’know just remember that it’s still really early, okay so, if it says that I’m not pregnant, that doesn’t mean that I’m not gonna get pregnant, okay and, and just please, just so I don’t go completely nuts, just try not put all your hopes on this.  You guys! You guys! You’re gonna have a baby! They’re gonna have a baby!  Okay, but this can’t be good for the baby.  Rachel?  I’m, uhh, making up flyers trying to get new massage clients. So, can I come to Bloomingdale’s and use the copy machine.  Oh my God. What happened?  Thank you.  Now you will not believe this. But, I was in the copy room, making copies, and Ralph Lauren came in.  Yeah a little. He seems really nice. Good kisser.  Totally.  Yeah. I was just in there. He introduced himself and the next thing I know, we’re making out. You know.  No!  That’s not Ralph Lauren. Sounds like him though.  Yeah, no, Ralph doesn’t look anything like that guy. He’s-he’s young and he’s got long hair and a beard and a hacky sack.  What?  Why would the copy guy say he was Ralph Lauren?  Ohhh.  But why didn’t you just tell her the truth.  Well, hey, what if Kenny were the real brains behind the whole company? You know. What if Kenny hired that Ralph Lauren guy to be the pretty front man? Huh, did she ever think of that?  Just for a second.  Well, the only thing you can do. Sleep with Ralph Lauren.  Ohh, sleep with Kenny.  Ohh, yes it would.  Hey!  Ohh! We went to a self-defense class today!  Now, we can kick anybody’s ass!  Yeah it is! It is! It’s freshwater eel!  You mean in case someone is trying to steal your bamboo sleeping mat or your kettle of fish?  No.  Ooh, Joey, that’s actually a really good idea!  You guys!  Oh, I love paper mache! What did you make?  What is that?  Ross!!!  Ohh, you’re a freak!!  Pat Sajak?  Alex Trebek?  Chuck Woolery?  Say we are unagi!  Why is Ross doing that?  We should help him!  Um, is, is there any chance that you\\'re rounding up? You know, like from, like 20?  It\\'s Ross.  Can you believe how much this is gonna cost?  Yes, yes, and it\\'s, and we always have to go to, you know, someplace nice, you know? God, and it\\'s not like we can say anything about it, \\'cause, like this birthday thing, it\\'s for Ross.  Let\\'s see!  Wow, look at these prices.  Um, I\\'m gonna have a cup of the cucumber soup, and, um, take care.  No, huh uh, no way, I\\'m sorry, not gonna happen.  I\\'m sorry, Monica, I\\'m really happy you got promoted, but cold cucumber mush for thirty-something bucks? No! Rachel just had that, that, that salad, and, and Joey with his like teeny pizza! It\\'s just...  Not for you.  Fine. All right, fine.  Well, then...Let\\'s.  No, now I feel bad. You wanna go to the concert.  Yeah.  Oh, it\\'s like a skit.  Cool.  So...Thank you.  Actually, it makes us feel that big.  I\\'m just gonna pass on the concert, \\'cause I\\'m just not in a very Hootie place right now.  Oh, well, then you\\'ll have extra seats, you know, for all your tiaras and stuff.  Fine.  Ok. One.  We just have to really, really, really, not let stuff like money get--is that a hickey?  Oh! I can\\'t believe it. I can\\'t believe this. We\\'re just like, sitting at home, trying to guess Joey\\'s fingers, and you guys are out like partying and having fun, and you know, all, \"hey, Blowfish, suck on my neck\".  Oh.  Oh... Mike\\'s sister just invited me to a party tonight, he\\'s gonna be there. And she was like \"Oh, don\\'t worry! I asked him. He\\'s totally ok with seeing you!\". So now I have to go so he\\'ll think that I\\'m totally ok with seeing him!  Exactly!  Ok, that\\'ll be great!  Oh, I\\'ll take some of that.  Ok!  So what were you doing out there, do you not like Charlie?  Why?  Who else?  You like Joey?  Uh, wow! Isn\\'t it ironic that he liked you and now you like him?  Oh well, as long as it is under control, you know, you can\\'t do anything about it, he\\'s already dating her, and she is a nice person, that wouldn\\'t be right.  Yeah.  Sure!  Oh.  Any chance Charlie has a deaf twin?  Well, maybe she didn\\'t hear! Ok I\\'m gonna go into that dressing room, you stay in here and I\\'ll talk and see if you can hear me.  Ooh! We have a problem.  Good plan.  Are you sure? Because I\\'m really dreading going to this party.  Mike knows I\\'m coming, and if I don\\'t show up he\\'ll think it\\'s because of him! And I don\\'t want to lose face! That\\'s a very serious thing in my culture.  You got it! Ok. But not on the wine that you made, ok, because I just don\\'t want to go back to the Emergency Room.  David?  Yeah. What-what are you doing here?  What happened?  Yeah?  Well, it\\'s great that you\\'re back! How are you?  Good!  Mike and I broke up.  Really?  I understand. Yeah. Ok so then ok, so we\\'re both living in New York, not seeing anyone. That\\'s so not like us!  I\\'d love to.  Oh, got it, stay upwind of me.  It starts?  Hey! Ross!  I need to talk to you, it’s pretty urgent. It’s about Monica and Chandler.  Well, umm, not much. But, I was just thinking that since those guys just got engaged that maybe it would be nice if they had some privacy, y’know? So, could I just move in with you for a couple days?  Nothing—Why?!  Oh yeah it is! I’m going to the movies and it starts in like five minutes.  Oh Ross, hi.  I’m sorry, I’m with a client right now.  Okay, let’s talk outside.  What’s the big deal? I did it at Monica and Chandler’s!  Okay, I will find someplace else to do the rest of my appointments. I just don’t know what the big deal is!  Look, why don’t you just pay for it yourself?  Wow, money and a firm hand. Finally a Chandler I can get on board with.  My massage client, Arthur? His daughter called and said that some guy that worked for me gave him a really weird massage this afternoon.  He said you poked at him with wooden spoons.  Well, he’s never coming back! Okay? You just cost me eight dollars a week!  Oh, it’s my fault?! You didn’t have to massage him! You could’ve sent him away! You could’ve not rolled Tonka trucks up and down his back!'},\n {'character': 'Ross',\n  'concatenated_lines': 'Amazing!  Oh, you guys call him Cute Coffeehouse Guy, we call him Hums While He Pees.  It’s not a club.  Hey, divorced men are not bad men!  Soon he’ll be able to call you, that lady he knew who got fired.  Maybe I should open a divorced men’s club.  I could put uh-uh a basketball court in the back.  Yeah?  What?! No!  All right! I want my key back!  Look, I’m sorry but you-you-you better go Pheebs.  Oh yeah—No—You’re welcome. We’ll talk about it later.  Hi Whitney.  Yes! That’s where we realized we were both super cool people!  Like what?  Okay.  Fine! Thank you for warning me. At breakfast I’ll be on full alert for room painting and sex weapons.  Yeah!  Pheebs come on! I mean, consider the source! Of course her ex-husband’s gonna say that stuff. Now, if you’ll excuse me…  Hi.  Listen, you are hearing one side of the story, okay—and F.Y.I she must’ve shown Kyle over 30 paint samples before she painted that room! And his response to each one was, \"I don’t give a tiny rat’s ass.\"  Well, I don’t think we are gonna have that problem, but maybe that’s just because I am not emotionally unavailable!  I think he can be.  Well, excuse her for knowing what she wants to do with her life!  My God!  Well maybe she wouldn’t have to be selfish in bed if someone else knew where everything was!  Wh-what’s up?  Oh just say it Kyle!  It makes him miss the bowl, but whatever.  That’s all right, we-we don’t need you. In fact, hey I’m over it already.  Yeah, were better off without them.  Divorced men’s club.  Uh, Rach, we\\'re running low on resumes over here.  Rach, did you proofread these?  Uh, nothing, I\\'m sure they\\'ll be impressed with your excellent compuper skills.  I don\\'t know.  What?  Who?  We\\'re fine, we\\'re fine.  Uhhhh... Joey cried last night.  Oh, guys, you should\\'ve seen him. \\'Read \\'em and weep.\\'  No, women are welcome to play.  Excuse me, do any of you know how to play?  No. No, uh, Phoebs? You can\\'t—you can\\'t do...  No, no. Uh... no, see, uh, you-you can\\'t do that.  Alright, now, you sure? Phoebe just threw away two jacks because they didn\\'t look happy...  The game, Rachel, the game. You owe us money for the game.  Well that\\'s fine with me. Could use the money.  I\\'m not a nice guy.  Alright boys, let\\'s eat.  You still on that?  You are way off, pal.  Um.... no. See, I might\\'ve had feelings for her at one time—not any more. I just—I...  Marcel! Where are you going with that disc?  You are not putting that on again! Marcel, OK—if you press that button, you are in very, very big trouble.  Alright.  I\\'m gonna pay for that tonight.  Hey.  Uh, Rach, do you want me to shuffle those?  Alright.  So, Phoebs owes $7.50, Monica, you owe $10, and Rachel, you owe fifteen big ones.  Well, that just leaves the big Green poker machine, who owes fifteen...  So, you gals wanna hand over your money now? That way, we don\\'t have to go through the formality of actually playing.  Uh... to the bathroom.  Oh, I am very in.  Show them to me!  Let me see! Show them!  First of all, I\\'m not losing...  Let\\'s not talk about losing. Just deal the...  I thought, uh... it was a fifty cent limit.  Fifteen.  Thank you.  You got me.  Uh.... bean! Bean!  What, are we keeping Thanksgiving a secret this year?  What? That\\'s like insanely easy!  What? You forgot fourteen states?  Wow, how many have you got?  Done! With time a-to-spare.  You know, I hate to lecture you guys, but it\\'s kinda disgraceful, that a group of well-educated adults and Joey can\\'t name all the states. Did you ever see a map, or one of those round, colorful things called \"a globe?\" Hmm?  What? That\\'s impossible.  No, just give me another minute.  This-this is crazy! I can do this! All right, uhh, I bet I can get all 50 before dinner.  You\\'re on!  Pshhshhh!  Phoebe, why is your bag moving?  Ohio!! Thank you!  What dog? There-there\\'s no dog here.  Are you out of your mind?  It\\'s too cold.  How can I not get this? I\\'m a college professor; I got 1450 on my S.A.T.s.  Damn, I forgot you were here.  Hey! What\\'s she doing back here?  Hey look, Phoebe. I, uh, I laid out the states geographically...  Yeah, but, but look what I\\'m...  Um, in Phoebe\\'s room. You can\\'t go in there.  Monica\\'s crying. She\\'s very upset about this whole Clunkers thing.  No. No, no. She doesn\\'t want to see you right now.  Because you sent away the dog!  Oh, is it? Is it? Look, when Monica and I were kids, we had a dog named Rover. And, uh, one day, my dad decides, he doesn\\'t like dogs. So Monica and her friend…Phyllis…take away the dog. And that was the last time we ever saw him. Don\\'t you see? This is just like that. Only with a few details changed.  I hate America! When I finish this game, I swear I am moving.  Okay, maybe this is so hard, because there aren\\'t 50 states. Let me tell you something, I have 49 states, and there are no more! I-I think, I should be able to eat something.  Well with Carol, I promised never to love another woman until the day I die. She made no such promise.  Well, why don’t you just start with something simple. Like umm, Monica from the moment I met you, I knew I loved you.  ...everyone, this is Chandler!  Hey!  Oh, we were helping Chandler write his vows, but he kicked us out because Joey kept making inappropriate suggestions.  How’s Monica coming along with her vows?  I can’t believe in four weeks they’re gonna be married!  Phoebe that’s not true.  Believe me, it seems like less because they hid it from us for so long.  What?! What?!  It’ll be okay Joe.  That little naked guy would be me.  Yes, yes, fine, that is my penis. Can we be grown-ups now?  Got me.  Dude! How-how did you write this?  You can’t do that!  Look, would you guys grow up? That is the most natural beautiful thing in the world.  This is my son having lunch, ok? It\\'s gonna happen a lot, so you\\'d better get used to it. Now if you have any problem with it, if you\\'re uncomfortable, just ask questions. Carol\\'s fine with it, now come on.  Carol?  Hello to the rest.  It\\'s a big deal to me. This is great, Monica. I really appreciate this.  Carol, we\\'ve been through this before, ok? We have a good time. We laugh, we play. It\\'s like we\\'re father and son.  My mommies love me. That\\'s clever.  Thanks Aunt Pheebs. Hey, you didn\\'t microwave that, did you, because it\\'s breast milk, and you\\'re not supposed to do that.  It\\'s breast milk.  Ok, would people stop drinking the breast milk?  No!  Not even if Carol\\'s breast had a picture of a missing child on it.  I did not freak out.  Because it\\'s breast milk. It\\'s gross.  No, no, Carol. There\\'s nothing wrong with it. I just, I just don\\'t think breast milk is for adults.  Oh, you\\'ve tasted it.  So what’s a matter, you need a dentist? I’ve got a good one.  Why? Why can’t you go to him?  Pheebs, come on, you didn’t kill anybody, these people just happened to die when you went to the dentist. It’s, it’s, it’s just ah, a coincidence.  Okay, I have a problem I have to go into work for a few hours, some kids messed up the Homo Sapien display.  Well, they painted over the word ‘Sapien’ for one thing, then they rearranged the figures, let’s just leave it at that.  Yes, that’s what I was going to ask, thank you.  Yeah.  Hmm?  Joey, Homo Sapiens are people.  How’s my little boy?  Oh my God, he just said your name, that’s great! Good job Ben.  And tell them what? The naked guy we stare at all the time isn’t moving.  Well, he’s finally alseep. About that ah, bump on his head?  It’s okay if he bumps his head, kids bump their heads all the time, y\\'know, it was your first time babysitting, I figured you did the best you could.  I know! I’m saying you have to watch them all the time.  Monica did it?  Monica?  Umm, did you notice anything wierd about Ben today?  Well, I was just playing with him, and y\\'know we were doing the alphabet song, which he used to be really good at, but suddenly he’s leaving out ‘e’ and ‘f.’ It’s like they just ah, I don’t know, fell out of his head.  Can we please focus here, a naked man’s life hangs in the balance!  He does not look happy.  Are you kidding?  She\\'s putting words in your mouth!  Hey! Hey, guess what Joey has!  Dude, I wanted him to guess.  Guess where they are?  Did I do something to you?  So?  He\\'s right, man.  We\\'re still going at the game, right?  Yeah.  Oh! What a game, huh?  I can\\'t believe Chandler is missing this!  Yeah, I\\'d probably enjoy it more if you didn\\'t keep batting my hand away.  Oh, but it\\'s a kind game! So we\\'re a little late, you know, the girls will be there, let\\'s stay just for one more goal.  One more fight!  Okay.  Forty-five minutes.  You may want to lose the foam finger!  Hey!  So, nobody\\'s here? Monica\\'s gonna kill us!  Yeah, yeah, what\\'s with the trophy!  You won an adult Thanksgiving day spelling bee.  You entered Emma into a Beauty Pageant?  I can\\'t believe this, she\\'s our daughter! That you would treat her like some kind of showdog is inexcusable!  So this is an annual thing?  Yeah. What are we gonna do?  Ooh, we\\'ll say that we were mugged! You can\\'t get mad at someone who\\'s been mugged!  I got mugged. And they stole my pocket.  Well, let\\'s just go in there and face them.  What is that?  Wha...? Oh sure, now they lock it, but when they\\'re having sex on the couch, its like: \"Come on in, my butt is surprisingly hairy\".  Come on you guys, we\\'re sorry, alri...? Our subway broke down.  How are we gonna decide who gets this?  That\\'s worse than no food.  I don\\'t know...  I feel terrible.  Really girls, not cool.  It\\'s a day to be thankful.  Yeah! Let\\'s go out.  Okay.  I gave them to Joey.  Nice!  I\\'m just so happy you guys are finally getting a kid.  I don’t know whether he’s testing me, or just acting out, but my monkey is out of control. But, he keeps erasing the messages on my machine, \"supposedly\" by accident.  And then, like three days in a row he got to the newspaper before I did, and peed all over the crossword.  Oh, Pheebs, I’m sorry, I’ve got to go. I’ve got Lamaze class.  No, Susan’s gonna be there too. We’ve got dads, we’ve got lesbians, the whole parenting team.  I know.  Susan is Carol’s, Carol’s, Carol’s, friend...  Like buddies.  You know how close women can get.  Although I was married to her.  Err, right.  A little.  It doesn’t matter. You don’t dip your pen in the company ink.  Marcel, Marcel, give Rossie the remote. Marcel. Marcel, you give Rossie the remote right now... Marce... you give Rossie the remote...  Relax, I’ll fix it.  You okay?  You wanna watch Laverne y Shirley?  Sorry.  Hi. Sorry I’m late. Where’s, where’s Carol?  No... No... No. I think I should stay, I think we should both know what’s going on.  Okay, I’m gonna play my sperm card one more time.  I see. So what do you propose to do?  Flip me for it? No, no, no... heads, heads, heads!  Susan, go deep.  Carol, honey, shhh, shhh, everything’s gonna be alright.  I’m gonna be a father.  I always knew I was havin’ a baby, I just never realised the baby was having me.  Aw, how can you say that? I can’t even get Marcel to stop eating the bath mat. How am I gonna raise a kid?  No, come on, he doesn’t know this stuff. If he knew how you felt.  Yeah! They’re putting together this panel to talk about these fossils they just found in Peru and The Discovery Channel’s gonna film it!  Thanks. You ready to go?  Y\\'know what I didn’t wear this suit for a year because you hated it. Well, guess what? You’re not my girlfriend anymore so...  Right.  Wow! That aspirin dance really works!  Oh my God, is that still...  No you’re not.  Rach!  Rach...  Rachel...  Fine. I’ll go.  Okay. This stuff?  All right.  Sorry.  Sorry, I’m sorry. Close, close, close...  I’m sweeping...  What? What?  There you go! Good enough for your party, huh?  Yep?  Okay, come on! All right, I gotta go! So good luck at the party. Okay?  What?  Rachel, I’ve seen you naked a million times. I ate hot fudge off you naked. Remember, I-I sucked that mini-marshmallow out of your belly button?  Rach, y\\'know I can see you naked any time I want.  Ah, I’m sorry.  Come on, would you grow up? It’s no big deal.  Yowzah!!!  Aww, come on.  Oh my God!  All right.  Look...  Okay.  Rach?  Easy. Easy. You have to go to the hospital. Okay?  Okay.  Okay, I’m gonna get your coat and then I’ll-I’ll put you in a cab.  Rach, you can’t look fat in an x-ray.  Oh, it was, nah, well....  I was kinda, supposed to be on TV tonight for The Discovery Channel.  Yeah.  Eh, ‘cause I knew that if I told you, you’d make me go, and I knew you needed someone to be with you tonight. Come on. Come on.  What?  So, I’ll umm...  No, that’s, no, as long as you’re okay. So I’ll ah, I’ll see you tomorrow.  I’m sorry the answer there would be...none of us.  Yeah, I’ll take some.  What?  Hey, y\\'know while we’re on that, when are you gonna tell my sister that you don’t live here anymore.  Phoebe, she doesn’t know that you sneak out every night, she doesn’t know that you sneak back every morning, and she doesn’t know that you’ve been living with your Grandmother’s for a week now.  Hey.  So how many more do you have tomorrow?  I have to go. Yeah, Carol should be home by now, soo...  Oh, better, actually. Y\\'know I-I-I think I finally figured out why we were having so much trouble lately.  Yeah, y\\'know how I have you guys, well she doesn’t really have any close friends that are just hers, but last week she meet this woman at the gym, Susan something, and they really hit it off, and I-I-I think it’s gonna make a difference  No real-, honey, really it’s fine, just g-go with Susan. Really, I, no, I think girls night out is a great idea. Okay, okay, bye  I don’t know, something girlie.  My marriage, I think my marriage is um, is kinda over.  Well, now I do!!  Seven years. I mean we’ve been together seven years, she’s the only woman who’s ever loved me, and the only woman I’ve-I’ve ever....  Maybe this would’ve happened if I’d been more nurturing, or I’d paid more attention, or I... had a uterus. I can’t believe this!  Thanks.  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  Wait, wait, wait.  My foot is stuck in the pocket.  No, I can’t get it out.  Oh well. It probably would’ve been the most constructive solution.  My wife’s a lesbian.  Hi.  Awww.  I know.  Well, I-I gotta go break up with Bonnie.  Well, yeah. I can’t-I can’t stay here all night, and if I go in there she’s-she’s gonna wanna... do stuff.  No, she likes that. Yeah. Faking sleep doesn’t work either, I can’t tell you how many mornings I woke up with her...  Whoa-oh, okay! Yeah, why am I telling you that?  Okay.  It’s over.  Done!  Well, I wanted to be thorough. I mean this-this is clearly very, very important to you, to us! And so I wanted to read every word carefully, twice!  I’m sorry.  Does it? Does it? Yeah, I wanted to give that whole ‘Does it?’ part just another glance.  Oh, sure! I’m sure.  Hey!  What happened?  It does. It really and truly does.  What the hell happened on that beach?!  What happened? Joey?  I missed you too.  And for the record, it took two people to break up this relationship!!  I didn’t know what I was taking full responsibility for! Okay?! I didn’t finish the whole letter!  I fell asleep!  Oh, no-no-no don’t you worry about me falling asleep. I still have your letter!!!  I dunno, maybe it’s because you’re really sarcastic. Or maybe it’s cause you uh-  For real?  Yeah, see, we-we-we have to stop across the hall, because it’s my sister. But, uh, uh y’know actually, growing up with a sister was nice because it really helped me understand women. Yeah, you-you should tell your friends that.  And the place looks so nice!  Happy Thanksgiving!  See ya!  Oh, oh, we did say we’d stop by this little thing Joey’s roommate is having.  Some would say she’s attractive, yes.  Oh, but-but it is, uh, it’s just like the first Thanksgiving, when the Indians and the Pilgrims uh, sat down to dinner.  Yeah, yeah, what is it?  W-What was the one right before bananas?  Beef in a dessert?! I- no no no, there is no way!  Oh my God, the pages are stuck together!  Oh My God, she-she made half a English Trifle, and half a...Sheperd’s Pie!  No, no, we will. We just won’t tell her she messed up.  Yeah, it’ll be like a funny Thanksgiving story!  Okay, I think I might know why my parents don’t like you.  Okay, remember, we were young. Hey, Spring break, sophomore year, I got high in my bedroom and my parents walked in and smelled it and so I told them that you had gotten stoned and jumped out the window.  I don’t know, aheh, your’s was the first name that-that popped into my head, I’m I’m sorry. I-I didn’t think it would matter.  How was I supposed to know we’d end up being friends after college, let alone you-you would be living with my sister?  I don’t know, I-I was all high.  Okay, okay, I’ll tell ‘em it wasn’t Chandler who got high. Now who should I say it was?  Alright, alright, now-now who should I say tricked me into doing it?  Okay, fine!  Oh, uh, can it wait a second Joey? I have to tell my parents something. No it can’t? Okay.  What?! What is with everybody? It’s Thanksgiving, not...Truth-Day!  Hey Rach, can I talk to you outside for a second?  So um...Thanksgiving. The holiday season is upon us, hm?  And um...You look nice today.  What?  It tastes like feet!  Are you kidding?  Oh yeah, about telling Mom and Dad, I was thinking about maybe writing a letter.  Wha-what?  Well I told you it was Chandler who was smoking the pot but it was me. I’m sorry.  Yeah, well, Hurricane Gloria didn’t break the porch swing, Monica did!  Monica and Chandler are living together!  I-I uh, I got tricked into all those things!  What?  Well, who\\'s gonna kiss my sister.  Awww, man! Really?  That\\'s a good point.  Oh well, since I have that whole history with Rachel, I guess Phoebe.  All right.  Well, everyone\\'s gotta kiss someone. You can\\'t kiss Ross you got the history.  Y\\'know what? I\\'m gonna go out on a limb and say no divorces in \\'99!  Just the one divorce in \\'99! Y\\'know what, I am gonna be happy this year. I am gonna make myself happy.  Everyday I am gonna do one thing that I haven\\'t done before. That my friends is my New Year\\'s resolution.  In fact, I\\'ll bet you 50 bucks that you can\\'t go the whole year without making fun of us. Eh, y\\'know what, better yet? A week.  Ohh.  I just asked that girl out.  That\\'s right, uh, Elizabeth Hornswoggle.  Hi, Pheebs!  All right, see you later.  What are you, what are you doing?  What, to blind my child?  Okay, it must just be me then.  That was just the pants on the couch. Umm, hey, do you, do you mind if I use your bathroom?  \\'Kay!  Oh my God!  Well, you can help me!  Listen, I\\'m in Elizabeth\\'s bathroom…  No, I-I got really hot in my leather pants so I took them off but they must have shrunk from the-the sweat or-or-or my legs expanded from the heat. Look, I-I can\\'t put them back on. I can\\'t!  Ohh, I-I see lotion, I have lotion! Will that work?  Hold on.  They\\'re still, they\\'re still not coming on man and the lotion and the powder have made a paste!  What difference does that make?!  Dude, what am I gonna…  All right, I\\'m coming out. Hey, can you turn the lights off.  I had a problem.  This year was supposed to be great! But, it\\'s only the second day and I\\'m a loser with stupid leather pants that don\\'t even fit!  Oh, be-because of the leather pants.  Oh ah, I think you know where I want to go.  Yeah!  Yeah!!  I’m telling you, I like the food!  Did that guy just call you Toby?  Well, why don’t you correct him?  Five years?! Chandler you have to tell him!  Chandler Muriel Bing. Boy, your parents never gave you a chance did they?  So, what do you want to do tonight? There’s a Ukrainian film at the Angelica that’s supposed to be very powerful. Interested?  Rach? You wanna come?  A date?  Why no, it’s the opposite of weird. It’s-it’s uh, regular. It’s-it’s uh, it’s mundane. It’s actually uh, a little dull.  A date?! She’s-she’s got a date?! With who?  You set her up?!  Joey what-what were you thinking?!  A ferry? My baby is going on a ferry? Do you have any idea how dangerous those are?!  Why don’t they just jump out of an airplane?! Huh?! That-that’s a fun date! Or burn each other with matches?! That’s fun too! Whew!!  Hi. I-I hear you’re going on a ferry tonight.  A bit of a daredevil are we?  Okay. Have a great time you guys.  Books?  Well, I tell you what. Why don’t we uh, why don’t we just stay here? Let’s not see a movie, we’ll just hang.  Hey, if that’s what you want to do I’m not gonna say no.  I just…I have to find out how it went.  This guy could be my baby’s stepfather!  I just—I-I can’t believe she’s-she’s dating?!  I don’t know! I guess I just can’t believe any of this is happening.  It’s just I always thought when I had another kid it would be different. Now I-I love Ben, but every time I have to drop him off at Carol and Susan’s, it’s like—It breaks my heart a little. I mean I’ve always had this picture of me and my next wife in bed on Sunday and, my kid comes running in and leaps up onto the bed. And we all read the paper together. Y’know? Maybe fight over the science section.  No! No I can’t. I mean Rachel’s out with some guy. My baby went with her. If anything that picture keeps moving further away.  It used to be. Now she doesn’t really have a face. Smokin’ body though.  No but ahh! How much easier would it be if it were?  No, it’s not what I want either. I mean I-I can’t force myself to fall in love with her again now.  Yeah.  Hello.  Well, how was the date?  Uh-huh. What happened?  Ah, he didn’t uh, take it so well?  Oh?  He sounds swell.  Hey, wanna…wanna a little cheering up?  Sit down.  Guess whose middle name is Muriel.  Yeah-ha!  I’m sorry about your date.  You wanna, you wanna grab some coffee?  Hey, I thought I cheered you up.  Right. Good night.  Yeah?  Oh hi!  Wow! Uh…how are you?  Oh that’s right. Well uh, would you be interested in seeing a Ukrainian film?  Great! Well umm…  Sure! Uh, let me get it for ya.  What?  Oh…my…God! I-I see what this is! You are in love with Rachel!  Of course! It all adds up! I mean you you’re obsessed with her. It’s always, \"Ross, what are you gonna do about Rachel?\" \"Ross, why-why are you moving in with Rachel?\" \"When are you gonna confess your secret marriage to Rachel?\" You want her!  Well remember that paper I had published last year on sediment flow rate, huh? They loved it.  I know! Anyway, they asked me to be a guest lecturer! I mean it’s temporary, but uh, if they like me it could lead to a full time job. How great would that look great on a mailbox, huh? \"Professor Geller.\"  Hey uh, well, today’s my first lecture and I kinda wanted to try it out on you guys, do you, do you mind?  No! Why?  Open with a joke? It’s a university, not a comedy club!  Thank you!  Please don’t say naked chicks.  I-I-I don’t even know why I bother to talk to you guys about it. Y’know what? I’m just gonna do it on my own with no naked chicks.  It went great! And I didn’t need any jokes or naked chicks either!  I knew all I had to do was let the material speak for itself. Everyone’s all, \"Ross you have to be funny and sexy.\" Well, I proved them wrong! And now, I’m gonna pass the news onto Joey and Chandler.  That’s right!  Look, I was nervous! You guys had me all worried I was going to be boring! I got up there and they were all like staring at me. I opened my mouth and this British accent just came out.  Will you-will you please?  Oh.  Just please stop!  They’re not listening too me?  Monica you really think I should try this phasing out thing?  What are you doing?  No thanks. I’m 29.  Oh sweetie, when do you think you’re going to get off tonight?  Oh come on, not again.  Hmm.  Yeah.  Now, if you need to stay late, I want to be supportive of that.  And what are you going to do for him?  Okay.  So, are you gonna see him again?  Naked friends.  Hey.  Oh.  Yeah, make that three.  What, what do you mean, what? Is he gay?  What?!  Okay.  Yeah, yeah, yeah!  Well, I suppose we just try to not look directly at it.  Umm, Jo’s a girl, it’s short for Josephine.  Hey! How’d the ah, basketball go?  Calm down. There’s no reason to get testy.  Good.  Joey’s asking if you’ve just ruined the first book he’s ever loved that didn’t star Jack Nicholson?  Oh.  It\\'s all right.  Hey, what took you guys so long? Your cab left when ours did!  Apparently she fell in the shower and hit her head.  Look, Pheebs-Pheebs, it\\'s gonna be okay.  Yeah, he\\'s head of the department.  Hello.  Hey, where are Monica and Rachel anyway?  To be fair, he doesn’t seem to be impersonating Fonzie…  Again, it\\'s not that he…  Okay, Phoebe, this Dr. Oberman. He has no strong feelings about Fonzie or any of the Happy Days gang.  Breathe! Breathe! Breathe throw the pain.  I do too! I do too!  Argh!  Argh!  You did it, man.  Oh no, not yet.  Oh. Thanks. Uh, has anyone seen Rach?  Yeah—oh! Hey listen umm, Emily found this wedding dress in London…  Yeah, but it didn’t fit. Well, luckily there’s a store here that has one left in her size, but I’m the groom, I’m not supposed to see the dress…  Thank you.  What’s wah-pah?  Hey!  Hey, do uh, do you have a minute?  So listen uh, I know you and I haven’t really had a chance to talk since uh, Emily and I decided to get married, and uh, I was just wondering how you were.  I know if you were getting married I’d feel, kinda….. y’know.  Yeah?  All right, I just wanted to check.  You’re great. And I-I know someday this will happen for you too. You just hang in there.  Oh, no, I didn’t mean, uh…  Oh, I thought you guys had just been on like four dates, I didn’t realise that had become anything, yet.  Oh. Yeah?  Wow, that’s-that’s-that’s incredible.  Uh-huh.  I gotta get to work.  Hey, y’know, y’know what would make me really happy?  If like the four of us could all y’know, hang out together. Uh, in fact Emily’s coming into town this weekend, why don’t you say we all have dinner? Say, Sunday night?  Hey man.  So, what are you guys doing four weeks from today?  Great! Because Emily and I are getting married in a month!  Yep!  Yeah!  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah! Yeah, Emily always wanted to get married in this beautiful place that her parents got married, but it’s going to be torn down, so… I mean, I-I know it’s crazy, but everything up ‘til now has been so crazy, and I don’t know, this just feels right. Y’know?  So, I got us some reservations for Sunday night, okay? How about, Ernie’s at 9 o’clock?  Oh, see I-I don’t know if we’re gonna be hungry at three.  What happened?  Noo. Why?  Oh, Rachel, I’m-I’m sorry.  Come here.  Yeah.  You okay?  So, I just finished this fascinating book. By the year 2030, there\\'ll be computers that can carry out the same amount of functions as an actual human brain. So theoretically you could download your thoughts and memories into this computer and-and-and live forever as a machine.  So uh, wha-uh, what do you do?  Thank you for bringing her into our lives.  Yeah, yeah man don\\'t do it. I mean if you date her, then-then-then I can\\'t date her.  Monica had such a crush on him. Yeah, she used to kiss his poster every night before she went to bed.  Yeah.  Hey!  Did you get Monica\\'s authorization to move all of her stuff?  Put it back exactly where you found it?  ‘Kay, first of all, this attitude is not helping.  Whoa, hello, did you just meet Monica?  Hmm -you know, actually this\\'ll work out well. Cause when you have to move back in with Joey, Joey\\'s hot new roommate can come and live with me.  Look Chandler, Monica is really weird about this kind stuff all right. Believe me, I lived with her for 16 years. She is going to freak…out. Oh my God, she\\'s going to sit on you.  Yeah that-that, doesn\\'t look right.  Whoa, whoa, but then the back of the couch won\\'t line up with he back of the carpet.  Whoa, Whoa, Whoa, but then the coffee table won\\'t be centered in the seating area.  Hey, I\\'ve been married 3 times  Look, we do not repel women OK? That is completely untrue.  Yeah, well what about you? You weren\\'t you know, so hot in college either. After everything he said, he\\'d go \"ba dum bum chessh\"  Oh y\\'know what, girls don\\'t like it when I start talking about science.  Uh, they don\\'t like it when you correct their grammar.  They don\\'t like it when you keep asking them if they like you.  Who cares? I repel women.  Why does anyone have to be naked?  I-I had to show Chandler something?  Yeah-yeah I uh, I have a uh, a guy problem.  Dude, what\\'d you have?  So really, what\\'d ya have?  So it said that by the year 2030, there\\'ll be computers that can carry out the same number of functions as an actual human brain. So theoretically we could download our thoughts and our memories into this computer...  That\\'s so Janine, you-you-you know what, do you know we\\'re doing right now? You and I, we\\'re interfacing.  Hey, when did you and Susan meet Huey Lewis?  Oh, you know the sex of the baby? Oh, oh-oh-oh!  Susan...  Yes, we did, everything\\'s A-OK!  Ok, what, what...ok, what did we think it was going to be?  Wha, heh, how could you know, I don\\'t even know!  Wait—oh—hey—huh, oh great now he knows, and I don\\'t know!  Hi Pheebs!  I\\'m familiar with his work, yes...  My God.  The actress!  Thanks Rach.  I think It\\'s the most beautiful table I\\'ve ever seen.  Come on, two on one.  What, now?  Oh you guys, I-I really think just one of us should go out there so she\\'s not overwhelmed...  Hey.  You all right?  What?  Huh.  See, Rach, uh, see, I don\\'t think that swearing off guys altogether is the answer. I really don\\'t. I think that what you need is to develop a more sophisticated screening process.  Uh, no, no, see, because not...not all guys are going to be a Paolo.  I-I\\'m, I\\'m having a boy?  I\\'m having a boy! Oh, I\\'m having a boy!  I\\'m having a boy! I-I\\'m having a boy!  I\\'m having a son. Um...  Hey!  Oh, yeah, no problems. It’s all taken care of.  Oh yeah, why not?  I didn’t get the annulment.  I know.  Well, I tried! But when I got to my lawyer’s office all I could hear was, \"Three divorces. Three divorces!\" Look, I just don’t want my tombstone to read, Ross Gellar, Three Divorces.  Look, all I know is I-I can’t have another failed marriage!  Well, okay so, I don’t have it all worked out quite yet. Just don’t say anything to Rachel, please?  Hey! Hi!  What’s up?  Bye.  Could ya just, could ya just lay off, please? All right? My life is an embarrassment! I should go live under somebody’s stairs!  Oh yeah? Have you ever dated anyone who has been divorced three times?  What?! Why?  …once you know the stories, it’s not that bad. First marriage, wife’s hidden sexuality, not my fault. Second marriage, said the wrong name at the altar, a little my fault. Third marriage, well they really shouldn’t allow you to get married when you’re that drunk and have writing all over your face, Nevada’s fault.  What?!  This is crazy! I mean, yes-yes Rachel is my good friend and I-I have loved her in the past, but now, she is just my wife! Phoebe, will you-will you help me out here?  We were drunk! I would’ve married uh, Joey with that amount of alcohol!  Yes.  Yes, second in two years. Third overall.  Basically, Rachel and I were in Vegas and we got drunk…  Yes-yes-yes! But, I-I do not love her.  This was just a drunken mistake and I need to get it annulled.  I think just the annulment for today.  Easy.  No problem.  Ooh! There’s no way to do this without her? ‘Cause I kinda all ready told her uh, it was, it was already taken care of.  Oh no.  I couldn’t.  It’s not that. Okay? Annulments are more complicated than I…  I… I do, I do not love Rachel. I’m gonna tell her right now about the whole thing so we can get this marriage annulled as fast as possible. Okay? Would I do that if I loved her?  Ohh, what’s wrong?!  Of course.  Yeah!  No.  C\\'mon you guys, this is really important to us.  Yeah, we want everyone to be there. As much as I hate to delay your doing weird sex stuff to my little sister.  Hey, I brought the camera for Emma\\'s video.  Yeah!  That\\'s the hope! So, is Emma awake yet?  Ah, and where is Joey?  Hey, say something to Emma on her 18th birthday!  Joey, NO!  When they see this you\\'ll be 52!  Oh, great!  Thank you so much for that gift!  Amazing... amazing.  Sure.  Uh, Rach? Does this bakery by any chance also bake erotic cakes? Say for bachelorette parties?  I am this close to tugging on my testicles again.  Hey Mon, that was really nice of you to loan Rachel your car so she could go and get the cake.  You guys, just please.. a little bit longer. I promise, Rachel will be back with the cake any minute. Monica, remember.. the frosting? huh?  No, Rachel got pulled over for speeding. She forgot her licence so now I have to bring it to her.  No, wait ! You guys, no, no, you can\\'t leave! Rachel already feels bad that the cake\\'s messed up. How do you think she\\'s gonna feel when she comes back here and all you guys are gone?  RACHEL!  Yeah?  Rach, she\\'s not going to remember this.  It\\'s not bad.  Well, I just made these two things uhm... cheeks. And then I split this to make ears.  Some can sing, some can dance. I apparently can turn phallic cakes into woodland creatures.  Joey, we just saw you come in. You ran past us on the stairs.  Oh my God! Our daughter\\'s a genius! Rach, this means...  Damnit! I\\'ll put a candle on the cake.  Okay, here we go! Emma\\'s first birthday cake... Well hey... well, blow out the candle. Come on Emma.  What\\'s wrong? Are you okay?  Okay, you ready?  A-a-and... record.  I mean, I don’t feel like I even have a girlfriend anymore.  Is this about Mark?  Okay, it’s not, it’s not.  Who’s that?  Is that Mark?  Yeah!!  Na-huh.  I love you.  Chloe, Chloe how’s it coming?!!  Umm, oh, hey, I don’t know. How about a big one?  Well then a small one!! Listen, let’s, we kinda have to get going!  Yeah!  Yeah, oh hey, you are right on time.  Yes, you can, very much.  You think?! God, I, ah, I’m in hell. I mean what, what am I gonna do? Rachel’s all like, ‘I love you and, and let’s work on this.’ And all I can think about is, ‘What is she gonna do? What is she gonna say?’ when I tell her what I did.  What?! Look, we’re trying to rebuild a relationship here, right. How am I supposed to do that here, without being totally honest with each other?  Yeah, but don’t you think....  What trail?  Oh, I-I don’t think there’s any trail.  You took my watch?  Just you keep it, listen did you, did you tell anyone about us?  Exactly. So you didn’t, didn’t mention anything to Issac right?  You tell, of course you do. Issac. Issac. Hey, Issac. Issac, hi! Y\\'know we haven’t actually met...  Yes, I suppose I am a dog. But Issac, see I-I happen to have a girlfriend.  Yeah, that’s the one. Listen, I don’t want to hurt her.  Yeah. Listen, can you keep this information to yourself?  Actually, no, we’re not.  No, we’re not.  No, we’re not!!  Right.  Fine. I just need to know that you’re not gonna tell your sister.  We met at Phoebe’s birthday party, I’m, I’m Ross Geller.  Yes, I did.  Very bad.  I’m agreeing with you. Did you, listen, did you happen to tell Phoebe yet?  Okay, Jasmine, please, please don’t. I love my girlfriend very much, and I want more than anything to just work it out with her. Okay?  Thank you, thank you.  Gunther! Gunther. Gunther, please tell me you didn’t say anything to Rachel about me and the girl from the Xerox place.  Rachel?  No, it was a mistake! I made a mistake! Okay?  No!!  No!! No!! I wanna stay. I wanna talk about this.  What?  She was...  She, she was different.  Nobody likes change.  What? Okay, okay, okay, okay.  I’m sorry, okay, I’m sorry. I wa-I was disgusted with myself, and this morning I was so, I was so upset and then I got your message and I was so happy, and all I wanted was to get her out of my apartment as fast as possible.  Listen. Oh hey, hey, the important thing was that she meant, she meant nothing to me!  Look, I didn’t think there was a relationship to jeopardise. I thought we were broken up.  That, for all I knew would, could last forever. That to me is a break-up.  Look, I’m not trying to get out of anything, okay. I thought our relationship was dead!  Come on! Like I wanted him to tell you, I ran all over the place trying to make sure that didn’t happen!  Look Rachel, I wanted to tell you, I thought I should, I-I did, and then Chandler and Joey convinced me not to.  Don’t you realise none of this would’ve ever happened if I didn’t think at that same moment you weren’t having sex with Mark?  What? Come on Rach, tell me what you’re thinking?  Order a pizza like, ‘I forgive you?’  Hey, can I, can I get in on that? Because I’m kinda hungry myself.  No anchovies.  That’s okay, I’ll just pick ‘em off.  You can have the last piece, if you want.  Y\\'know what, y\\'know what, I’m-I’m not the one that wanted that, that break, okay. You’re the one that bailed on us. You’re the one that, that ran when things got just a little rough!  That’s what?!  Okay, okay, okay.  What?  That commercial always makes me so sad.  I meant because the monkey in it reminds me of Marcel.  Sometimes I wonder if I did the right thing, ya know, giving him away.  Remember when sometimes he\\'d borrow your hat, and, and when you got it back there\\'d be little monkey raisins in it.  Hey guys.  Well, there\\'s this, uh, paleontology conference in L.A. so I figured I\\'d go and then drive down to the zoo and surprise Marcel.  Well, I uh, I can\\'t seem to find the monkey I donated last year. He\\'s a capuchan, answers to the name Marcel.  Oh my God, what happened?  I can\\'t believe this.  Well, ya know, someone should have called me.  Zoo dollars?  I was thinkin\\' about it.  Uhh, hey look, I don\\'t really enjoy being with other men that way. But, um, zoo dollars?  Buddy, my monkey?  Oh my God. But the zoo told me that my monkey was dead.  That, that\\'s the only thing the zoo\\'s ever told me.  That guy Lipson?  No, I, I only know Lipson.  Buddy, my monkey, my monkey.  Of course.  This is unbelievable.  Are you trying to get me to bribe you?  But you already told me everything.  Check it out, he actually is the MonkeyShine monkey.  Well, I guess I\\'m gonna call the beer company and try to find out where he is.  Well, there goes my whole belief system.  That\\'s right, he\\'s not Drake, he\\'s Hans Remore, Drake\\'s evil twin.  Hans...Hans...Yo evil twin.  Well, I tracked down Marcel and get this, he\\'s healthy, he\\'s happy, and he\\'s right here in New York filming Outbreak II - The Virus Takes Manhattan.  I know.  This is so exciting, I haven\\'t seen my monkey in almost a year.  Uh, excuse me, uh, where can we find the monkey?  Uh, I\\'m sorry, you don\\'t understand, I\\'m, I\\'m, I\\'m a friend of his. We uh, we used to live together.  I don\\'t get it, he seemed so happy to see me yesterday.  Hey Joey I have to cancel racketball for tonight, that was Marcel\\'s trainer. He\\'s gonna let me have him for a couple of hours.  Hey, we can rescedule for Saturday.  OK, got the music, got the dinner. Oh and check it out, I made Marcel\\'s favorite dish, banannacake.  With mealworms.  Hello. Oh hi, are you on your way ove-. Oh. No, no, I, I understand, I mean a monkey\\'s gotta work. No it, it\\'s no big deal, it\\' not like I uh, had anything special planned. Yeah OK, OK. OK, OK, bye.  Thanks for letting me tag along tonight you guys.  Hi Tushie.  What happened?  Ahh, oh that\\'s OK, I mean, he\\'s probably got, you know, parties to go to and stuff. But, ya know, he\\'s moved on. Hey, that, that\\'s the way it goes right.  What?  Bye Marcel. See ya on the big screen. You keep people drinkin\\' that beer, OK. I miss you buddy.  Hey! Are you ready yet?  Yeah, cheerie-o!  Well, we’re all here! I guess we should get going!  Oh, I’ll-I’ll come hug you.  Thanks.  So-so come! Why don’t you come?  To London! Come to London. Please? It’ll mean so much to me.  Why-why can’t you take a couple of days off?  This is my wedding.  Fine. You’ll-you’ll watch it on video when we get back.  All right, let’s go! Bye, Pheebs!  What?! No! No! That’s-that’s time-out!  Sweetie, you gotta relax. Everything’s gonna be great, okay? Come on. Come on.  Um-hmm! Doesn’t that sound delicious at the last minute?  Yeah. Yeah. Yes, this place is beautiful. Emily’s parents got married here.  It’s all right! Everything’s gonna be all right.  Uh-huh, I see that.  What? What?  Hey! I just spoke to your dad, and you know what? He seems to think we’ll be able to find a new place for the wedding.  Whoa-whoa-what? You found a place?  She said what?  The only thing I understand is; postponing it is not an option. This is when we’re getting married.  There’s no ‘or’ in mind. What is wrong with these pants?!!  Hi. I understand you had a little talk with Emily.  Am I?! And was it your idea to postpone the wedding?!  Hey-hey, since you’re the ‘fix-it’ lady, here’s a pickle, what do you do when the bride says she doesn’t want to have the wedding at all?  Yeah.  I don’t know, I told her it was stupid to put off the wedding just because the hall was gone and she liked flipped out.  Excuse me?  I don’t know. A month?  I had no idea. And that-that pillowcase thing, I thought you guys were just doing the flying nun.  Come on. You gotta help me figure out what to do. Okay?  Okay? But-but imagine a lot more lights, okay? And-and y’know fewer bricks, and-and-and flowers, and candles…  But-but, if you don’t love this, we’ll do it in any other place at any other time. Really, it’s fine, whatever you want.  And, I don’t know, if it starts to rain…  what’s up, Dad?  Look, face it, my father is not going to pay for the build-in barbecue and believe me you can kiss you gazebo goodbye. Now I might be able to get you the new lawn.  I go back there with lawn ornaments, he’s going to laugh in my face.  Look, were down to just one point. Could we please, maybe just settle it after the wedding.  I’m getting married, to..day!!  Ahh, whoo-hoo!!(He runs back out the door.  Nothing, nothing. Everything\\'s under control.  I Ross...  Hey! So what\\'s the big news you had us rush all the way over here for?  Oh my God!  Monday?!  You can\\'t go, I mean you\\'re the glue that holds this group together!  Not you.  I went thru this with Ben and Carol. One cup of coffee won\\'t affect your milk.  Rach, you don\\'t have to call whenever you have a little question, okay? Trust me, I know this.  Rachel, I can see you dialing! I don\\'t understand why...  Rach, you can\\'t call people at three in the morning.  Was there anything you did wrong with Emma?  Well, what was it?  Rach, I told you, you can\\'t call him every time any little thing comes up.  Dr. Gettleman? Yeah I know, I don\\'t think that\\'s a good idea. In fact, I think he\\'s dead.  Rach, I promise first thing tomorrow we\\'ll find another doctor, but I gotta get up early and I\\'m not feeling all that well.  Thanks doctor.  Hey!  You promised you wouldn\\'t say anything.  He\\'s a brilliant diagnostician!  Why? Why? I know it\\'s a little weird, but hey, he\\'s a great doctor, okay? He knows my medical history, and every time I go in there, he makes a big deal. \\'Ah look, it\\'s my favorite patient!\\'  Hey, I seem to remember someone bringing his security blanket to college!  It didn\\'t spend much time on the wall!!!  Excuse me, I don\\'t mean to be a jerk, but the baby with the rash came in after me.  With the circus? He\\'s behind the elephant.  Yeah, that\\'s how I know. I\\'m Ross by the way.  I am a single parent.  Well, let\\'s say, I don\\'t know, you met someone in the pediatrician\\'s office.  Hey, I helped you find Waldo!  I got held up at Dr. Gettleman\\'s office. There was some guy that freaked everybody out.  Oh man.  You said you’d marry Joey?  So you said yes to him, and you just had our baby?  So when I came in here to see if you wanted to maybe start things up again, you were engaged to my best friend.  Rachel said she’d marry you?!  In the closet.  Linen closet.  In the hospital.  No I left the diapers at the hospital! There’s some in the bag but I’ll run out and get some more.  Sure what kind?  Please take your time, it’s an important decision. Not like, say, I know! deciding to marry someone, this is about a muffin.  Blueberry it is.  Yep.  Yep, can you believe it?  And I can even understand that you couldn’t tell Rachel, but why couldn’t you tell me, huh? You had all day to and you didn’t.  Not using it right, Joe.  I’m gonna go.  Give me the bag.  Joey!  I’m not gonna hit you.  No I don’t.  No.  No!  Give me the bag.  Give me the bag.  Joey, give me the bag.  Joe I’m not kidding…  No!  You ducked!!  Oh my god, this really hurts!!!  What is the matter with you?!?  Why don’t we talk about this on the way to the hospital?  I broke my thumb.  Just Ross!  You know my birthday.  October 18th.  Actually I’m a palian… Dinosaurs is fine… the drawing is not.  Ah, Rachel I guess.  Just ah… just put roommate.  I don’t think that we are.  Well, I thought so too, but then she said she’d marry you.  Yeah that’s what she said.  So I don’t wanna be just anybody.  You know what, it’s, it’s better this way anyway. I mean I don’t know what I was thinking, going down that road again with us. It’s just much easier if we’re just friends who have a kid.  Yeah.  Hey.  Ah I had a little thing with Joey, if you think this is bad you should see him.  Okay.  What, Rach?  Oh yeah, let me just finish this.  Have you seen this? It\\'s a new alumni website for college! It\\'s cool! You can post messages for people, let everyone know what you\\'re up to.  It\\'s actually kinda interesting to find out what people are doing... remember Andrea Rich?  Uh uh... well, her Internet Company went under and she lost an ear in a boating accident...  No... I already e-mailed her.  You know what? I\\'m gonna finish this later, ok? Let me just grab my coat.  I think you made it clear you cannot be trusted with the ball inside the house!  I can\\'t believe you put that on my alumni page!  You\\'d better hope not because I just read what you put on your page today.  Oh oh oh! I RESPECTFULLY DISAGREE!!  Posting that I died? That really isn\\'t funny.  Oh please, hit by a blimp?  Unbelievable, my classmates are gonna think I\\'m dead, my professors, my... my parents are gonna get phone calls. You\\'re messing with people\\'s feelings here.  You\\'ve really crossed the line here, but that\\'s okay, it\\'s ok \\'cause I\\'m on my way to buy some Photoshop software and a stack of gay porn. That\\'s right! Your coming out is about to get real graphic.  What are you talking about? You get sixty responses just for coming out of the closet! I didn\\'t get one response! And I\\'m dead!  You\\'re right. There isn\\'t a decent outlet.  No! That would be stupid! You\\'re having it for me!  oh, too late, too late! It\\'s sent... oops sorry and so is the picture of you and the police man...  It\\'s been an hour and not one of my classmates has shown up! I tell you, when I actually die some people are gonna get seriously haunted!  Who is he?  It isn\\'t ridiculous, look around! No one\\'s here!  Yes, you\\'re right. Still somebody must have seen it... I mean, I went to that school for 4 years, I didn\\'t have an impact on anyone?  Did you hear that? Kori Weston had a crush on me!!  And here\\'s little Ben nodding off...  Hey.  I\\'m going to China.  Hey, is Rachel here? Um, I wanted to wish her a happy birthday before I left.  No.  At the coffeehouse, right.  OK, I\\'m gonna go say goodbye to the guys.  Hi.  No no, this big pile of dishes in my mom\\'s breakfront. Do you guys know who Carl is?  Well, Rachel\\'s having drinks with him tonight.  I know.  I can\\'t believe you\\'d rather go out with him than me.  Fine, just stop thinking about me.  Can\\'t do it, can you?  I don\\'t get it. What do you see in this guy, anyway?  Rachel, come on. Give us a chance.  No, no, no... why, because it might get weird for everyone else? Who cares about them. This is about us. Look, I-I\\'ve been in love with you since, like, the ninth grade.  I know.  Whoa, whoa, whoa. What makes you think we\\'re gonna break up?  Well, start looking.  Oh, hey, hey, I got that.  No problem. I cannot wait for you to meet my friends.  Yeah.  No, no, they will. I just... uh...  Come on, they\\'re gonna love you.  Pheebs, did…you want a cookie?  Hey guys!  So uh, any ideas for the bachelor party yet?  I sort’ve already asked Chandler.  Joey, I figured you’d understand. I mean, I-I’ve known him a lot longer.  Hey, how can it not be me?!HeyHey!  Fine, y’know what, that’s it. From now on, Joey, I want you to be my best man.  Great. Great.  Yeah. Tell ya what, let’s not invite any of the anthropologists, only the dinosaur dudes!  Oh, just planning my bachelor party with my best man.  Yeah, see, I don’t think it’s gonna that difficult considering this one won’t be taking place in the basement of a Pizza Hut.  Look, I gotta go pick up Ben. Everything so far sounds great Joey, just remember to keep it on the mellow side, okay? Just a couple of guys hanging out playing poker, no-no strippers or anything okay?  Okay, see ya later.  Hey listen man, about the stripper…  Good call!  Hey-hey, what are those?  Wow! Yeah!  I just wanted to thank you again for last night, what a great party! And the guys from work had a blast. Y’know, one of them had never been to a bachelor party before. Yeah! And-and another one had never been to a party before, so…  Yeah, right!  That ring? When my grandmother first came to this country, that ring and the clothes on her back were all she had with her.  Oh absolutely! It has been in my family for generations, and every bride who has worn it has had a long and happy life.  My-my ring? My-my wedding ring? The-the stripper stole my wedding ring?! H-how?! How could this all happen?!  Not on you! On the stripper!  Okay, well, we’ll call the company that sent her!  So what, Joey? Wh-wh-what? What are you telling me? That there’s nothing we can do? Well, how could this happen?!  Diverse.  Where’s my ring? My dead grandmother’s wedding ring? Where is it? Where is it?  We know you took so just-just save yourself the time and confess!  Joey! The vet said it’s a simple procedure.  No, that’s all right.  Hey! Hey! Hey! I get to choose my best man, and I want both you guys.  Total wuss!  Hi.  Hi, we have a little bathroom emergency.  Uh, before we do uh, are any of Joey’s special romance magazines in there?  Hey listen can you do me a big favor? The dean’s office just called and said there was an urgent meeting. Can you watch Ben for like an hour?  Oh, she isn’t home.  Well, Ben would be there.  What’s the matter?  Rach, he’s not an ex-con.  I don’t know! Just-just talk to him-entertain him and keep him alive.  I have a bone to pick with you.  Yes! Ben learned a little trick.  That’s right! That’s right! Saran Wrap on the toilet seat so the pee goes everywhere!  Yeah that! You know I hate practical jokes! They’re mean and they’re stupid and-and I don’t want my son learning them!  I was barefoot. Now tell me, the toilet thing is the only thing you taught him right?  Rachel! What are you doing here?  Your good friend?  What’s her last name?  Nice. And by the way that uh, that line down my face?  Of course I was mad! I told you I-I hate this stuff! Okay? It-it’s not funny!  Hi.  Practical jokes.  You have a line down your face.  Uh, y’know what? I’ll tell you who it hurts! It hurts the kid who has all his clothes stolen in gym class so he has to go to the principal’s office wearing nothing but a catcher’s mitt!  I will be! Listen, I don’t want you teaching my son that stuff anymore. Okay?  No that’s not what I want. Uh, I’m glad you guys were bonding but I…  Hey!  Hey I’m sorry to do this to you again but uh, is there any way you can look after Ben for a little bit? I-I’ve got this meeting at school. And-and he-he asked for his uh, ‘Fun Aunt’ Rachel, so…  Okay, I’ll see you later pal.  What?  Wait! No! Ben, come here! I am not kidding!  Emily\\'s cousin kicked me out!  Well, when you\\'re subletting an apartment from your wife\\'s cousin and then you get a divorce, sometimes the cousin suddenly wants his apartment back.  Who needs a lease when it\\'s family!  You got it.  Thanks you guys, I really appreciate this. All right, I\\'m gonna get packing again. Man, I\\'ve been moving around so much I\\'m beginning to feel like a nomad.  What?  Oh, yeah I know, I know, it\\'s a lot of boxes, but again I really appreciate you guys letting me stay here.  Pretty cool, huh?  I\\'ll take sports.  All right. Uhh, international.  Well, I guess I can check out those apartment listings, even though there\\'s never anything in here.  Oh, I-I don\\'t know, it\\'s kind of expensive for a studio.  Okay, let\\'s go.  Oh-oh-ooh, hey guys, I was wondering if you guys would uh, maybe chip in on some new air filters for the air purifier? I mean after all, we all are using it.  I think this is it. I don\\'t know, maybe we should keep looking.  All right, I see what you guys are saying. I\\'ll uh, I\\'ll go downstairs and fill out an application.  Hey. So I uh, I didn\\'t get that apartment. Some problem with my application.  Yeah. But, the good news is that Phoebe said that I could stay at her place for a while. So…  Look, you guys don\\'t need me here taking up your space.  Are you guys sure about this?  All right.  A no sex pact huh? I actually have one of those going on with every woman in America.  Cassie?  Wow, I haven’t seen her for like forever. I wonder if she still carries that Barbie everywhere she goes.  So what! I still have—No you’re probably right.  What—why?  What?! Chandler she’s our cousin!  Fine, she can stay at my place. By the way, what-what does Cassie even look like now.  Hey!  Oh. Oh, that’s right. So-so you did see me that day because it seemed like you didn’t.  It’s okay. Come, come on in.  Oh.  Uh-huh. Yeah I-I have a knack for impressions.  Yeah—No!!  Cassie, how you-how you doin’ on that…hot dog.  Hey! What are you guys looking at?  Yeah? Wow! It looks really violent!  Now I cannot wait to see this.  Rach, we gotta go.  People ask me why we’re not together, I just don’t know what to tell them.  Uh, do you wanna go change first? The doctor’s keeping the office open late for us, but if you hurry…  Fine! Fine! Y’know what? Whatever you want. Okay? You’re the mommy.  Yeah?  Uh-huh.  Mmm?  Wow!  Oh nothing. Nothing! Just uh, you’ve been a little short with me lately. I’m not trying to irritate you.  Y’know what? The doctor will be in soon, why don’t we not speak until then.  Y’know we should probably ask the doctor if she even knows how to deliver a baby that’s half human and half pure evil!  Do them!!  You’ve got to be kidding me!  Hey.  Yeah, we tried them all. We went for a walk, uh we tried a special tea, caster oil, spicy food nothing has worked.  It’s sex.  Monica!  Monica, what is the matter with you?  What?!  Can I get some of that action?  Come on, finish your enchilada.  Stop it.  I’m sorry, but we have to have some boundaries! My God, I’m dying.  This is insane, I’m not gonna make love to you just so that you’ll go into labor.  Always a great way to get in a man’s pants.  I love when you talk dirty to me.  Okay enough! This is, this is not going to happen.  Y’know what?  Forget it.  I’m getting that baby out of you!  Oh, I know.  I am good. Okay! Okay! Uh, I got the pillow! I got the bag! You got the keys?  Hey!  We’re having a baby.  Not so much.  C\\'mon, Chandler, I love your mom. I think she\\'s a blast.  Oh, please...  When did Rigatoni get back from Rome?  Ah, so then his plane didn\\'t explode in a big ball of fire?... Just a dream I had- but, phew.  Uh, I\\'m not really a shot drinking kinda guy.  Anyone want me to appraise anything?  Nothing. Nothing nothing nothing.  No. It\\'s the one he\\'s licking.  You\\'re good.  The girl on the cover with her nipples showing?  When?  The guy on the cover with his nipples showing?  Please.  Right.  Uh-oh...  Hey, is Chandler here?  Okay.  What code?  Uh.. uh.. Well, Joey and I had discussed getting in an early morning racquetball game. But, um, apparently, somebody overslept.  No, no I don\\'t, because it\\'s being restrung, somebody was supposed to bring me one.  Okay, I\\'m scum, I\\'m scum.  I don\\'t know, God, I... well, it\\'s not like she\\'s a regular mom, y\\'know? She\\'s, she\\'s sexy, she\\'s...  Well... not in the same way...  Okay, I think we\\'re getting into a weird area here...  Hey.  Well, not playing raquetball!  He didn\\'t get the goggles!  Do they wait for me to do this?  Why would I tell him?  Oh...  You\\'re my friend. I-I had to tell you.  I was really upset about Rachel and Paolo, and I think I had too much tequila, and Nora- um, Mrs. Mom- your Bing- was just being nice, y\\'know, and- But nothing happened, nothing- Ask Joey, Joey, uh, came in-  Thanks, man, big help.  I wasn\\'t- I mean, I-  I know-  Chandler-  Chandler-  Joey-  I cannot believe we\\'re having this conversation.  Oh, uh, Phoebe just started a...  Chandler, can I just say something? I-I know you\\'re still mad at me, I just wanna say that there were two people there that night. Okay? Two sets of lips.  Okay, well, if she always behaves like this, why don\\'t you say something?  No! Okay, you mean, you\\'re not gonna talk to her, you\\'re not gonna tell her how you feel?  Ah, the forbidden love of a man and his door.  You\\'re kidding.  Wow!  \\'Kay, wait a minute, are you sure she didn\\'t say \"When are you gonna grow up and realise I am your mom?\"  So, what\\'s going on now?  Whaddya see?  You mean that?  Yeah? How\\'d it go?  Well, howdya feel?  Wait, did you get to the part about his \\'huge throbbing pens\\'? Tell ya, you don\\'t wanna be around when he starts writing with those!  Huh?  What?  Joey come—I can’t believe—I bring you here to see the Bapstein-King comet, one of nature’s most spectacular phenomenon, and all you care about are bugs stuck in tar and-and some woman!  Show me where?  Joey!  Rachel!! Monica!!  I can’t believe this!!  Yeah! Oh yeah, you’ll be fine! It-it’ll be uh, just like bungy jumping. Y’know? But instead of bouncing back up you-you won’t.  Well, I’m gonna lie to you Joey, it’s a possibility.  Okay. Well, you be careful.  Well I’m jumping! I have a son! Okay? He won’t have a father if-if I die!  Okay, do-do you have a good grip?  Okay, I’m going to start climb down you now.  Okay. Now-now-now should I climb down your front so we’re face to face or-or should I climb down your back so we’re-we’re butt to face.  I would say that.  Okay, here I go.  I prefer not to answer that right now, I’m still carrying a little holiday weight.  So what do you want me to do?  Hi.  It’s still looks pretty far!  Do not rush me!!  Oww!! My ankle! I really hurt my ankle! I think I twisted it when I—Ooh, a quarter!  Hey  Wow, Monica’s letting other people help decorate her tree! Did someone get her drunk again or?  … and that’s the story of the dreidle. Now, some people trace the Christmas tree back to the Egyptians, who used to bring green palm branches into their huts on the shortest day of the year, symbolising life’s triumph over death. And that was like 4000 years ago.  I am so over Janine. I mean, yeah, at first I thought she was hot, but now she’s like OLD NEWS!  Hi Janine!  You’re gonna be a party person! Those guys rock the most!  Oh, well you see how it works is, the part with Dick Clark in Times Square is actually live, but they tape some of the party stuff ahead of time. Yeah, not a lot of people know that.  Are you serious?  Bye Janine!  It was a dry day.  Oh my God!  Got it!  Oh my God it’s just like I dreamed it!  Yeah, I have a question. When is this gonna air?  Right. No biggie. Stay loose.  Why do they keep doing that?  Right.  Hey, what’d you guys do to get up on there?  Yeah!  We know!  Okay.  Hey, I know what’ll get us up on a platform!  The routine!  Hey, when the snippy guy sees the routine, he’ll wanna build us our own platform!  We got honourable mention in the brother/sister dance category! Look, it’s almost fake midnight, do we really have any other choice?  So, do we really have to ask who’s going up on the platform next?  Can you believe this? We’re gonna be on the platform for the Millennium moment!  No!  I don’t know, I mean you were a lot bigger, I mean, stronger back then.  No! No! No! The \"Come here to me\" is y\\'know for the ladies.  Yeah?  Oh, sure. Whoa-whoa, what\\'s this? The delivery charge is almost as much as the couch!  Oh, come on it\\'s only three blocks! And-and, it\\'s not very heavy, try it! Come on! Come on!  Yeah!  What\\'s that supposed to mean?  Not that it\\'s any of your business, but we did go out.  Yeah! Rach?  Then tell him quickly.  Not only did we go out, we did it 298 times!  Uhh, yes I did but there isn\\'t. Okay, here we go.  Good-good-good.  Yeah, you got it right? You got it right? You got it?  Come here to me. No-no, you come here to me.  Oh great! What, you brought Joey?  Chandler?! You brought Chandler?! The next best thing would be Monica!  Oh, that\\'s me.  No! That\\'s-that\\'s my arm!  Y\\'know what? Just-just follow my lead.  Come on, Chandler.  All right, ready?  Turn.  Turn! Turn!  Okay, I don\\'t think it\\'s going to pivot anymore.  All right, let\\'s uh, let\\'s bring it back down and-and try again.  I can\\'t believe that didn\\'t work!  I\\'d like to return this couch. I\\'m not satisfied with it.  That\\'s what I\\'m telling you.  This couch, is cut in half! I would like to exchange it for one that is not cut in half!  Look, I am a reasonable man. I will accept store credit.  Oh perfect, we were just gonna see if you wanted to go.  How rude.  Hi!  Great to see you!  How you doing?  Okay! You take care!  Hey Pheebs, what-what was the deal with you and Chandler blowing us off before?  Phoebe, why’d you do it?  What?! Why?!  I can’t think of anything.  Wait a minute, is it because Joey and I didn’t invite him to that Knicks game a couple of weeks ago?  I guess it could.  Well, if he’s angry, he really shouldn’t just cover it up. I-I wish he would just tell me the truth.  Hey, remember how Chandler and Phoebe blew us off yesterday?  Remember? You-you were eating pizza.  Okay. Well, apparently Chandler’s angry at us for not getting him a ticket to that Knicks game a couple of weeks ago.  Yeah! Anyway, I-I still think we should try to patch things up, y’know? Like uh, maybe we could get him to get tickets to another Knicks game and invite him.  All the time?  Hey! So uh, was he excited about the tickets?  What?!  Y’know what? He didn’t want to talk to us about being angry, well maybe we don’t talk to him at all!  That’s right!  Eh? We’ll show him!  Wait a minute, is this, is this for real?  So you two are really serious?!  Hey-hey Pheebs!  Chandler’s gonna ask Monica to marry him!  You told her before you told us?  And, uh, and then I kissed her.  Yeah.  Hi.  That, that is funny. That is painfully funny. No, wait. Wait, yeah, that\\'s just painful  Yeah, it was, but...I get home, ok, and I see Julie\\'s saline solution on my night table. And I\\'m thinking to myself, oh my god, what the hell am I doing? I mean, here I am, I am with Julie, this incredible, great woman, who I care about and who cares about me, and I\\'m like, what, am I just gonna throw all that away?  How are you?  Good.  I don\\'t know what to do. What am I gonna do? I mean, this, this is like a complete nightmare.  Can\\'t we just use a pen?  I don\\'t know. I mean, all right, I guess you can say she\\'s a little spoiled sometimes.  And I guess, you know, sometimes, she\\'s a little ditzy, you know. And I\\'ve seen her be a little too into her looks. Oh, and Julie and I, we have a lot in common \\'cause we\\'re both paleontologists, but Rachel\\'s just a waitress.  I don\\'t know.  Yes, it was horrible. She cried. I cried. She threw things, they hit me. Anyway, I did the right thing.  Hi.  I uh, I just got back from uh, from Julie\\'s.  No, no, uh, it\\'s not what you think. It\\'s um the other thing.  Well, uh.  Really. It\\'s always been you, Rach.  Ok. No, hey, whoa, whoa, I\\'ll get your coat.  Hey, someone order a coat?  That\\'s it? That\\'s all you wrote? You\\'re the worst writer in the whole world.  No, you don\\'t.  Ok, just, just remember how crazy I am about you, ok?  Now that\\'s a little spoiled. He was supposed to type \"little\", the idiot.  No, that, that was, I mean, as opposed to uh, the uh, ok. Is this over yet Rach?  No, no, wait, ok, ok, look at the other side. Look at Julie\\'s column.  No, Rach, come on. Rach! Rach, no, no! She\\'s not Rachel, she is, she is not, Ra--Rachel?  Rach! Whoops! Rach, hey, open up, please!  I just wanna read something. It\\'s your pro list.  Number six: the way you smell.  Hey, Joey. You wanna open the window?  I am, uh, I am...  Rach, come on, open up. Rach, come on, come on, Rach. You got to give me another chance.  No?  Rach, come on, look, I know how you must feel.  No, but, but I wanna be with you in spite of all those things.  You know what? You know what? If, things were the other way around, there\\'s nothing you could put on a list that would ever make me not want to be with you.  Hi.  Look, can, can you do something for me?  Real magic does exist.  Ah, somebody’s at the door on the ceiling.  Hey Chandler, there’s a party tomorrow, you’ll feel better then.  Oh, somebody’s feeling better.  Hi!  Wow!  What, so this guy is helping you for no apparent reason?  And he’s, he’s a total stranger?  Huh. Sounds like Mark Something wants to have some sex.  Well, I’m just saying, I mean why else would he just, y\\'know, swoop in out of nowhere for no reason.  Hey, Joey. Are men ever nice to strange women for no reason?  Uh-huh.  Hi.  Yeah. So um, I-I heard about this ah, Mark guy that ah, Rachel met today.  Oh yeah! So ah, kinda pretty, pretty good. He sounds like a nice, good guy.  That’s excellent.  Yeah.  Which one is Gina?  That’s okay.  Hey, Joey.  Ah, which, which one?  Mary-Angela.  All right, look, look, you’ve got to do this yourself, okay in person. At least you know her name. You just go to the house and you ask for Mary-Angela, okay, when which ever one she is comes to the door, you take her for a walk, you let her down easy.  Where in Cuba?  Bummer.  No, I’m genuinely sorry the Mark thing didn’t work out. Look, Rach, I want only good things for you.  But, you, you don’t want to seem too pushy.  That is so made up!  There you go.  Yeah well, if I know Mark, and I think I do, I’d expect nothing less.  High collar and baggy pants say I’m a pro.  ‘Why don’t you call him?!’ Well, thank you very much! Y\\'know now he is going to prep her, y\\'know prep her, as in what you do when you surgically remove the boyfriend!  Am I! Am I! Am I out of my mind! Am I losing my senses!! This dreamy guy is taking my girlfriend out for a meal.  No.  Well, yeah!  Hi!  How’d did it go?  I’m so proud of you.  Listen, I’m ah, I’m sorry I’ve been so crazy and jealous and, it’s just that I like you a lot, so...  Yeah.  Maybe he’s just jumping on a pogo-stick and really likes it?  Maybe the pogo-stick likes it too?  Because there are naked ladies there.  There are naked ladies there too.  Come on, man! Just-just take the sweats off. Okay? Just take ‘em off and we’ll have some fun.  Hi!  Are you kidding?!  He hasn’t gotten out of that chair in two days.  Hey!  Hi!  No.  You want me to take some girl I’ve never met to the opera so you can go to a club and flirt with some guy, hmm, that-that is a toughie.  All right, I’ll do it.  Please hurry.  When we first met her, she was soaking, her feet were wet! Who wouldn’t be miserable? I’m telling you when I got her into a dry pair of shoes, she was a totally different person.  Hey!  Hey! You were so right!  Uh, what you said, about us being in a place where we could finally be happy for each other.  I mean, I, I-I admit I-I wasn’t quite there. Y’know, I mean the thought of you and that-that Josh guy…  Joshua…guy at that club, dancing and having a good time, the thought of it kinda…y’know.  But now! I’m there! I’m totally there! I’m-I’m finally where you are!  Yeah, and-and thank you for Emily.  I couldn\\'t possibly eat another bite.  Huh, I don\\'t know what to pick. Am I more thankful for my divorce or my eviction? Hmm.  I\\'m sorry. It\\'s just that this is the worse Thanksgiving ever.  Oh God, no.  You\\'re right. Yours is worse. You are the king of bad Thanksgivings.  In this life, Phoebe.  Yeah that\\'s the same.  Uh, everyone, this is Chandler! My roommate and lead singer of our band!  Oh, this is Monica.  Oh, mom. Mom. Chandler hates Thanksgiving and doesn\\'t eat any Thanksgiving food.  So uh, Rach? Does it, does it feel weird around here now? Y\\'know since I\\'ve been away at college.  Umm, I\\'m sorry Judy, I couldn\\'t find that bowl that you and Jack were looking for.  So I’m thinking about asking Rachel out tonight. Y\\'know maybe play her that song we wrote last week.  Yeah.  Listen, Roland Chang, if things go well, I’m gonna be out with her all night.  All right, it\\'s cool you can stay here. My parents won\\'t mind.  Hey!  I can\\'t believe you let George Michael slap you.  So uh, where\\'s Monica?  Dude!  Oh mom! Okay, umm, her name is Carol. And she\\'s really pretty. And smart. And uh, she\\'s-she\\'s on the lacrosse team and the golf team. Can you believe it? She plays for both teams!  Can you please not do that feet first? You know where his injury is! Severed toe, you just said it!  Rach!  Hey.  Oh. This was amazing.  Yeah, well, this guy at work gave me \"Sex for Dummies\" as a joke.  Who\\'s laughing now?  What?  Oh my God!  Phoebe, you were sure Ben was gonna be a girl.  Is Rachel here?  Uh, we, y\\'know, we worked things out.  Hey, I\\'m not one to kiss and tell, but I\\'m also not one to have sex and shut up. We totally did it!  I know, it\\'s pretty great.  Oh, I.. I don\\'t know. We didn\\'t really get to talk.  I don\\'t know. It was incredible. I mean, it just felt so right. When I was holding her, I mean, I never wanted to let her go. You know what? Yeah, I do. I wanna be together.  Shhh!  Wow, I hadn\\'t thought of that. I hope not.  Hey.  Hey. How did you sleep?  Good.  Uh. Would you guys mind giving us a minute?  So...  Morning.  It really was.  I know, me too. It was... You know, it was like one of those things you think is never gonna happen, and then it does, and it\\'s everything you want it to be.  And then she said it was the perfect way to say goodbye.  Nothing! What do you say to that?  No way!  What?  You really think so?  Okay.  Alright, you know what? You\\'re right. I should at least tell her how I feel.  What? What?  Oh my God!  I\\'m not getting you a muffin!  Hey.  No, and I\\'m not going to.  Because she\\'s just going to shoot me down. You guys saw what happened with Gunther. That did not look like fun.  Yeah, and she still wants to go! It\\'s pretty clear where she is.  Look, even if I were gonna tell her, I don\\'t have to do it now. Okay? I\\'ll be seeing her again. We\\'ve got time.  Oh my God! You did that yourself?  Oh my God!  Oh my God!  Okay, okay, awkward question. The hospital knows you took two, right?  Oh my God.  Aw, he\\'s gonna be so happy.  Neither will I.  Yeah.  Yeah?  Yeah, that\\'s true. Except I don\\'t wanna get over her.  I don\\'t! I wanna be with her.  Yeah, I\\'m gonna go after her.  My coat...  I don\\'t know, but I.. Look, even if she shoots me down, at least I won\\'t spend the rest of my life wondering what would have happened. Where - where is my coat?!  Okay, guys, wish me luck.  There\\'s no seatbelt!  Alright, alright, let\\'s do this!  Hey!  No, you don\\'t understand. This isn\\'t a real cab.  Are we off the bridge?  Is the old woman on the bicycle still alive?  Oh my God, Phoebe, slow down!  Yes, but I don\\'t wanna die in your cab!  What?  Okay!  To talk to Rachel, isn\\'t that why we took a ride in the death-cab?  Not since my cop-show got cancelled.  What? We\\'re never gonna make it!  Okay, if you could all walk slower, that\\'d be great.  Hey, I need a ticket.  Fine, two tickets, I need two tickets.  I don\\'t care. Whatever is the cheapest.  Okay, flight 421 to Paris. I don\\'t see it, do you see it?  No, no, no. That\\'s impossible. It doesn\\'t leave for another 20 minutes.  What? Hey, hey, listen..  Monica? Monica, Monica, Monica, Monica..?  That\\'s alright. Listen, listen.  Monica? Monica, Monica, Monica, Monica..?  That is precious! Listen! I need Rachel\\'s flight information.  Yes, that\\'s what I have. It\\'s not on the board.  What?  JFK.  Phoebe! Wow! No, no, no!  Phoebe, forget it, okay? Newark is - is like an hour away. There\\'s no way we\\'re gonna make it in time.  I am not doing this over the phone.  Yay.  Where is she?  Rachel! Rachel Green!  Rachel! Rachel!  No, no, I just have to talk to someone.  No, no, no, but...  Okay, the thing is..  Don\\'t go.  Please, please stay with me. I am so in love with you. Please, don\\'t go.  I know, I know. I shouldn\\'t have waited \\'till now to say it, but I\\'m.. That was stupid, okay? I\\'m sorry, but I\\'m telling you now. I love you. Do not get on this plane.  Hey, hey. I know you love me. I know you do.  No, you don\\'t.  No, you don\\'t.  Rachel?  I really thought she\\'d stay.  Oh my God!  Let her off the plane!  Try to understand!  No! No! Oh my God. Did she get off the plane? Did she get off the plane?  You got off the plane.  I love you too, and I\\'m never letting you go again.  Me neither, okay? We are - we\\'re done being stupid.  This is it. Unless we\\'re on a break.  Don\\'t make jokes now.  Wow.  Uh, I haven\\'t.  Do you realise we almost made it ten years without that coming up?  Hi.  So uh, Emily just went to the airport.  Eh, her-her uncle already had planned on doing it. And y’know, we-we said our good-byes this morning, so…  And why do you care so much?  You had fantasies about Emily?  Is that why in junior high you were the only one that hung out with that Ukrainian kid?  Ahh.  We said it was only going to be two weeks, y’know?  What-what is love really?  I am a good kisser.  I just, I had to see you one more time before you took-off.  That’s no problem.  I did.  Thank you.  She said, \"Thank you.\" I said, \"I love you.\" And she said, \"Thank you.\"  What do I do now?  She already lives in London.  Okay! Okay! But if she doesn’t call, it is definitely over! No, wait. Wait. Unless, eventually, I call her, y’know just to she what’s going on, and, and she says she’ll call me back, but then she doesn’t. Then it’s over.  Emily, hi! Uh, how-how was you flight?  No, no, that-that, that’s all right. Umm, I’m just glad you called.  Does that mean the same thing in England as it does in America?  She doesn’t know which one of us she wants, me or this Colin guy.  Well…  I’m not proving anything. Okay, I’m done listening to you. If I hadn’t let you talk me into going to the airport in the first place, I never would’ve put my fist through the wall!  No, I missed and hit the door. But, it opened really hard!  What?  I made fun of his accent.  No.  Really?  All right. All right, I’m gonna do it!  I’m gonna, I’m gonna go to London and I’m going to fight for her.  No, because she hasn’t come home yet. And she hasn’t been home all night! She’s obviously staying with that other guy, and I’m the stupid moron who spent the whole night outside her apartment!  About four hours.  Hi.  Ohh! Thank you.  Hey!  Oh, that. Umm, she took it really well.  No.  I am not in love with her. She was very upset about having to move out so I eh, didn’t tell her we were still married because she would only get more upset. I-I just comforted her, as a friend.  It’s nothing, I just gave her a hug.  It’s also a sign of friendship.  S-s-smell her hair? What if I did?  Rach, uh, you still looking for a place?  Okay, there’s this guy, Warren, from the museum and he’s going on a dig for like two years and he’s got this great place he needs to sublet. So uh, you interested?  Okay, you go grab it!  I don’t know what you’re talking about.  Look, I do not re-love her.  Look, we’re just friends now! Okay? Why would I do anything stupid?  You can live with me.  What?  Well, I’m-I’m just glad I could, y’know, help you out.  Hero, I uh, I don’t know—well, all right.  Hey! Oh listen, I was just clearing some space for your stuff.  What do you mean, they’re not moving in? They-they’re still moving in right?  What?! Over a stupid room!  Oh no, yeah no, that part’s great!  What’s all this about you guys fighting?! Is this really over a room?! I mean, that is so silly!  Well, apparently not, and I can’t just stand by and watch two people I care about very much be hurt over something that is so silly. I mean, enough of the silliness!  Okay! All right! Now, Chandler you-you wanna live with Monica, right?  And Mon, you wanna live with Chandler, don’t ya?  You’re never gonna believe it uh, Monica and Chandler are moving in again. That’s great news right—I mean for them. Right?  Yeah but, on the bright side, we get to be roommates again.  Wh-why?! Why-why-why would it, why would it be weird?  No!  No! No! It would be weird if we were still in that place, I mean are you still in that place?  Good! Me neither! So it’s not a problem. We’re just two friends who happen to be roommates.  Really?! We are?  Ohh! That would be great.  So are you sure about this whole moving in thing?! I mean it’s a really big step! And-and what’s the rush?!  No, I-I-I’m serious, okay? I mean, think about it. You move in, you start fighting over stupid game rooms, next thing y’know you break up!  Fighting?!  Yeah. There’s no breaking them up, is there?  I’ve been back and forth.  Ehh, I don’t, I don’t think so. She’s already talked about y’know, dating other guys.  Yeah, well, m-maybe you’re right.  Is that what I want?  Whoa! Whoa! Whoa, Joey!  So why don’t you quit?  Who is Maria?  You need me to go down there with you and hold your hand?  So you’re strong enough to face her on your own?  They make you take an oath?  Then how do you explain the toe ring?!  Whoa-whoa-whoa, hey! Now remember what we talked about, you gotta be strong.  One more time, \"Hey, don’t you want a washboard stomach and rock hard pecs?\"  Good! That’s good!  Me? No.  No! And I’m not gonna be, so you can save you little speech.  And that’s funny, why?  Or! Or, we could go to the bank, close our accounts and cut them off at the source.  And that’s not against your oath?!  Hello.  We’d like to close our accounts.  No-no.  No! And somehow, we ended up with a joint checking account.  Why are we in bed together?  No! But we-we didn’t have…sex-uh, did we? I mean, I don’t remember much about last night, it was such a blur.  And we didn’t have sex.  Hey!  What?  Yeah!  What?! Hello! We didn’t get married.  We-we-we—I remember being in a chapel.  I—They would not let us get married when we were that drunk!  Laugh it up, but the joke’s on you. Because we don’t need to get divorced, okay? We we’re just gonna get an annulment.  What?  No-no, that’s-that’s not my thing! I do not love getting divorced!  Hey!  Yeah. Yeah, actually um, I wanted to talk to you about that whole annulment thing?  Yes, exactly!  Wow! This is so amazing. I uh, I really thought I’d have to talk you into this more.  I’m-I’m not kidding. Look I-I, I can’t have three failed marriages. I can’t. Okay? I-I am not gonna be that guy!  Okay, look, how is this gonna affect you? Really? I mean you fill some form out once and a while and instead of checking the box that says Ms you check the box that says Mrs.! It’s right next to it!  I’m asking you to do me a favor.  And as my wife I think you should grant me this favor.  Hey!  I don’t know if it’s true.  Oh, okay, y’know what this is? This is a difference of opinion. And when that happens in a marriage...  All right. All right, I’ll do it.  Hey!  Oh, yeah, no problems. It’s all taken care of.  Oh yeah, why not?  I didn’t get the annulment.  Ohh…  Y\\'know, I think they have those at that British pub near the trade center.  Isn\\'t Rachel supposed to be back by now?  Oh, so-so you talked to her. Did she, did she sound mad?  Okay, I did not abandon Rachel! Okay? Emily showed up at the airport! I had to go after her! I mean, I-I did what I had to do! She\\'s my wife! Rachel is my wife! Y\\'know—Emily! Emily, is my wife! Man, what is that?  No, not since I lost her at the airport.  Rach, Rach, I am so sorry. I am so-so sorry.  That\\'s it? You\\'re not mad? I mean, it must\\'ve been terrible.  So, what? That\\'s it?  Hi.  She\\'s doing her laundry.  It came in the mail today, it\\'s uh, 72 long-stemmed red roses, one for each day that I\\'ve known and loved Emily, cut up into mulch!  Oh, it\\'s not so bad. Monica\\'s gonna make potpourri! I think I\\'m gonna go wander out in the rain for a while.  I can\\'t catch a break!  What thing?  Hey everybody, Pheebs is here!  Wait! It was my plan.  And, I came up with Atlantic City.  The paper.  Events from around the globe.  Sure. Once, at work I-I thought carbon dating was fossilized…  Yeah.  Go ahead.  Wow. Umm… Huh… I\\'m-I\\'m not sure what to do with that right now.  What? What? Was that a joke? \\'Cause it\\'s mean.  Why are you laughing?  Well, well I am married. Even though I haven\\'t spoken to my wife since the wedding.  Well, I kinda half to. I mean, because the thing is…  That is what the thing is.  No. No. No, I\\'m-I\\'m glad you did. Look, if nothing else, it\\'s-it\\'s always great when someone tells you they love you.  No thank you for… Thank you.  Okay, let\\'s go!  Pheebs, Pheebs, the babies are coming now.  I know what you mean, I’ve always wondered how different my life would be if-if I’d never gotten divorced.  The first time! No seriously, imagine if Carol hadn’t realized she was a lesbian.  No, I just think Monica was that fat.  What?!  Hey, do you guys think that if all those things happened, we’d still hang out?  No-no. It’s-it’s me, Ross!  No, no-no, Ross Geller.  Yeah. Right.  Is-isn’t it the best?  Oh really, really great! Yeah! A-actually she’s right down the street, umm, do-do you know what? You should stop bye and say hi.  Yeah? Oh-oh, she’d be so excited!  No, it’s okay. Some-some kid asked me to pick it up for him, but I don’t…  Hey Mon!  Come on Pheebs, it’s not that bad! Y’know most people would be excited if they didn’t have to work for a couple of weeks.  Well umm, I’ve been doing a lot more of my kara-tay.  Yeah.  Well, last weekend…  …will be two months…  …since I stopped trying.  What-what do you mean?  Oh.  Wow!  Okay, I think I got it.  So honey, this morning was fun, huh? Me hopping in on you in the shower there.  Look Carol umm, I was, I was thinking maybe uh, maybe we can spice things up a little.  Carol our sex life is—it’s just not working…  Hey there little fella! Hey, uh-hey, why don’t we get some shoes on ya, huh? Hey, why don’t you show dad how you can put your shoes on, in your room! Yay!!  I got it!  J-j-just relax, nobody yelled. Jack just was calling to make sure that you were getting better.  So honey this uh, this threesome thing umm, I mean how-how are you gonna start to find…  Yeah? Well, I-I think Ben’s asleep.  Hey, Pheebs!  Hey, how’s it going?  She doesn’t know she was fired yet, does she?  Hey Pheebs, maybe this whole heart attack thing is a sign, that-that you should start think about getting a different job.  We’re really gonna do this, huh?  Okay.  I’m-I’m Ross by the way.  How hot is this?!  Hey!  Look at you! You’re up!  Hey Joe did… Did you ever have a threesome?  No! The reason I’m asking is that… I sorta had one last night.  Yeah!  Yeah!  It was, it was okay.  Look, it’s just did, did you ever go to a party and think, \"Would really anyone miss me if I weren’t here?\"  Oh-oh, absolutely!  It’s just, my part seemed to be over pretty quickly and then, and then there was a lot of waiting around.  Not-not really. Th-th-there was just Carol.  No, she kept kicking me away!  No!  Oh I a lot of stuff!  A little. Yeah. I made a snack.  Just a sandwich. Turkey, a little mustard…  It really was!  Hey Rachel.  Umm, no.  That-that’s always good news. Are you okay?  Yeah.  We’re sorry.  Didn’t you spend last night at Joey’s?  Look I-I don’t know what’s going on with you and your husband and what is hopefully an adult dog walker, look can I just say not all men are like that.  Hey! There are some men who will do whatever it takes to make their marriage work! Okay? There are some men who will stand by and-and watch as their wives engage in-in what only can be described as a twosome with some-some woman she barely knows from the gym!  Men. I guy I know.  I’m sorry your husband cheated on you.  Try telling my wife that.  Oh, we went to see a collection of Victorian doorknobs and the Cupert-Hewitt museum.  Yeah.  Yeah, she’s got to go back to London. But you know what? I’ve been prepared for this from the start. We both knew we had two weeks together, and that’s it. Y’know.  Pheebs!  Well, as much as I’d like to meet Josh and warn him, Emily and I aren’t going to be here. All right? I mean, she’s going to come by first to say good-bye, and then I’ve got a whole special evening planned. So I’m sorry, no party.  You really didn’t know?  Yeah, but we-we have to be at the Four Seasons for drinks in 15 minutes and then y’know, then The Plaza for dinner.  No-no-no, no, umm, actually American surprise parties are-are-are very short. It’s usually, \"Surprise!\" And then, \"Oh my God, I’m so surprised—good-bye!\"  Yes, we have something we have to get to.  What big thing?  Okay, we could still make dinner if we skipped the appetisers and asked for our check right away.  That’s okay. She’s still in there enjoying her fake party and uh, it’s too late to do any of the things I had planned, so…  Yeah.  Helps a little.  Yeah, have a seat.  That’s okay, I mean it was just two-week thing anyway, I just didn’t want it to end this way, y’know?  What do you mean?  Yeah, I really do. Yeah, but what am I gonna do, I mean we-we both agreed that it was gonna be a two-week thing, y’know no commitment.  You think?  Hey, you’re right.  About what?  Well, you-you’ve always had glasses.  Are you sure?  No, why?  My dad wanted to know if you wanted to play racquetball with us.  Yeah and he didn’t really ask for you, he asked for Chancy, I assumed he meant you.  No, I-I thought it would be more fun this way.  Or you can sit with him on the front porch and make sure no one steals the trash cans. He does that every week too.  Yeah.  You’re not a lefty?  Oh, we have to get you an engagement present?  No one got me an engagement present.  Two! I’ve been engaged twice!  Well I had a great time! Umm, Chancy on the other hand…  And what did he ask you not to call him?  ‘Cause otherwise they’d have to call it the room room.  Now, I know you wanted to bond with my dad, but did you really have to bond to that part?  Oh, but he will. He still tells the story how Monica tried to escape from fat camp.  Then how did you get caught in the barbed wire?  You were trying to eat it!  Whoa-whoa, aren’t you a little over dressed?  Thank you!  Hey.  Yeeeeeep… Yep-yep-yep-yep-yep. I remember when she took out on her dad’s boat she wouldn’t let me help at all.  Let’s give it a shot.  Ohh, these are pretty good.  Which one was that?  Looking up?  Aww, Pheeb, come on isn’t there any relative that would have the recipe? What about, what about your sister?  That’s the day you’re gonna die? See—darnit, I’ve got shuffleboard that day.  Pheebs, what\\'s wrong?  Guess who\\'s a finalist for a huge research grant! I\\'ll give you a hint, he\\'s looking right at you.  Oh, I\\'m so excited, I mean, apparently I beat out hundreds of other applicants, included five guys I went to graduate school with. Not that I\\'m keeping score or anything... five!  Well, ok, it\\'s for 25 thousand dollars. And if I get it, I\\'ll finally be able to complete my field research! And there will be an article about me in the \"Paleontology Review\"! Yeah! That\\'ll be the first time my name is in there, without people raising serious questions about my work!  Yeah. Why?  Your ex-boyfriend?  So, your ex-boyfriend is gonna determine if your new boyfriend gets this grant? Wow, your new boyfriend is screwed!  Well, if you think it would help.  Ok, now, is there anything I can do to... you know, butter him up? Anything he really likes?  We\\'ll see how dinner goes.  I can\\'t believe I\\'m about to meet Benjamin Hobart. I\\'ve always thought of him as one of the people I\\'d invite to my fantasy dinner party. Do you think there\\'s any chance he\\'ll bring Christie Brinkley or C3PO?  Well, I... I am having a good hair day.  I\\'m ok.  Ok well, I would like to do a dig in the painted desert.  See, there are still several areas that haven\\'t been fully excavated.  What?  Did you just say \"break up with Charlie\"?  Kind of inappropriate, don\\'t you think?  Are you serious?  No!  Wha...? Wait, wait, wait, just a minute. None of my questions have anything to do with Paleontology.  Oh come on!!  I have to break up with Charlie?  You\\'re crazy.  Crazy!  Your ex-boyfriend is insane.  No I didn\\'t, and you want to know why? Because your ex-boyfriend is still in love with you.  Yeah. He wouldn\\'t give me the grant, because I wouldn\\'t give you up.  Really? Is it ethical to ask someone in a grant review, who was the voice of \"Underdog\"?  If you don\\'t believe me, let\\'s go talk to him, okay? I\\'m telling you, he didn\\'t ask me one paleontological question.  Oh, I\\'m sorry, no. He did ask me one. Uhm... How do you spell Mboscodictiosaur?  Damnit!  I want you to tell her everything. About the deal you tried to make with me, about the crazy questions you... Wally Cox! That\\'s the voice of Underdog!  No, no, no. Don\\'t do that! I want you to look her in the eyes, and tell her the truth.  Too little, too late, Benji!  What?  or...  Sweetie, this conversation is starting to make me a little uncomfortable.  Okay, that\\'s it. WE ARE SEEING OTHER PEOPLE!  Ohhhh…  It wasn’t the best.  Well, the lighting was okay.  Oh, nothin’ much. Just trying to figure out what I’m gonna do for dinner.  What you got over there? Tacos?  Uhh, those are tacos.  Oh really? Well I-I guess Monica should know about Atlantic City.  Well, Chandler and I are in a bar…  And this girl is making eyes at Chandler, okay? So after awhile he-he goes over to her and uh, after a minute or two, I see them kissing. Now, I know what you’re thinking, Chandler’s not the type of guy who just goes to bars and makes out with girls, and you’re right, Chandler’s not the type of guy who just goes to bars and makes out with…girls.  Oh Mon, I laughed so hard…  Whatever dude, you kissed a guy.  All right! All right! Chandler entered a Vanilla Ice look-a-like contest and won!  Oh, is that funny?! Oh, you-you find that funny?! Well maybe Chandler should know some of your secrets too!  Once Monica was sent to her room without dinner, so she ate the macaroni off a jewelry box she’d made.  Monica couldn’t tell time ‘til she was 13!  Ohh! Ohh! In college, Chandler got drunk and slept with the lady who cleaned our dorm!  Whatever dude, you kissed a guy.  And in my defense, the cleaning lady came on to me!  And! We should keep all the stuff uh, we told each other secret from everybody else.  Hi.  Why not? It’s built into the price of the room.  Thread!  What disposable cameras?  No you didn’t.  No. Sorry man.  Well, I’m sure they’re still somewhere here in the hotel. I’ll-I’ll help you look for them.  In-in three minutes.  Chandler?  No. Did you?  Well I checked in the uh, lost and found, I talked to the manager, no-one’s turned them.  Now you guys just got married, why is she so depressed?  I’m just thinking about your new bride at home. Okay? Do-do you really want to start your life together by letting her down?  I’m telling you, this looks exactly like your wedding! Aren’t these the same flowers?  What about the chairs?  How about the place settings?  What did you do?  I heard it. I heard it.  Okay. Okay!  Will the owner of a 1995 Buick LeSabre please see the front desk? Your car is about to be towed.  A ’95 LeSabre?!  A green LeSabre?  I’m sorry, I meant a blue LeSabre.  Yeah.  Now you are going to love these.  Huh, didn’t see that coming.  Hey! How you doing?  Yeah.  Oh hey, right back at ya.  Yeah. She—Well, she’s one crazy lady?  He is so weird.  Hey!  I’m sorry I’m late, did I miss anything?  Oh, on a date. Yeah, I met this girl on the train going to a museum upstate.  Okay, it was just me and her at the back of the train, and I sat near the door, so she’d have to pass by me if she wanted to switch cars. She was totally at my mercy.  No, I’m getting back down ‘cause she lives in Poughkeepsie. She seems really great, but she’s like totally great, but she lives two and a half hours away.  Oh, wow! I should get going. I-I got a date tonight.  You know that girl I told you about who lives up in Poughkeepsie?  Not her. Yeah, this is someone else I meet, and I-I can’t decide between the two of them. Y’know the one from Poughkeepsie, even though she’s a two hour train ride away, is really pretty, really smart, and-and a lot of fun. But this other girl, well, she lives right uptown. Y’know she’s, well she’s-she’s just as pretty, I guess she’s smart, she’s not fun.  Well, I-I want to give her another chance, y’know? She lives so close. And, at the end of the date, the other time, she-she said something that was—if she was kidding was very funny. On the other hand, if she wasn’t kidding, she’s not fun, she’s stupid, and kind of a racist.  Hey!  I wasn’t sleeping.  The one with the cat. I gotta go, I’ve got another date.  No, it turns out that the one from uptown was making a joke. But it was a different joke than I thought—it wasn’t that funny. So I’m still torn.  Y’know, you’re right. Thank you.  What?  Why aren\\'t you guys dressed?  No, four minutes ago you had a half hour, we have to be out the door at twenty to eight.  Well, you know, I\\'d feel a whole lot better if you got dressed now.  Really.  Hi.  \\'Cause, I\\'m a stupid, stupid man.  Yay! And that takes what? Just six or seven minutes.  No! Do you wanna hear it?  Uh, huh. Yeah, right after I thank everyone for giving money to the museum, I sing a song about the wonder that is Joey.  Hey!  Wow, hello! You look great!  You see this, this is a person who is ready to go. Phoebe you, oh, you are my star.  You guys, you know what, you know what, it doesn\\'t matter, because you both have to go get dressed before the big vain in my head pops. So..  That\\'s, that\\'s funny. Change!  Look, I don\\'t care it starts at eight, we can\\'t be late.  Look, our table is down in front, okay, my boss is gonna be there, everyone will see if we arrive after it starts.  Nevermind.  It\\'s old, it\\'s definitely old. Didn\\'t you hear the, the double beep?  Yeah, see Mon, listen, listen. When Carol and I broke up, I went through the same thing. And you know what I did?  Okay, look, we have nineteen minutes. Okay, Chandler, I want you to go and change! Okay. And then, when you come back, Joey will go change, and he\\'ll have vacated the chair. Okay. Okay.  No, no, no, no, no, no, not out of that, not out of clothes.  Okay, Mon, I really don\\'t think this is the... Okay, you\\'re dialing, you are dialing.  Oh, great. It\\'s starting to rain, that will make it easy to get a cab.  You don\\'t, you don\\'t know what your wearing?  Yeah, which, which we have to leave for in exactly twelve minutes. All right, come on, I\\'ll just pick something out for you.  Look, I\\'m sorry, I thought it looked pretty.  Look, I didn\\'t recognize it without that inflatable sheep.  Not for tonight. Not for tonight! Wh-what, what, what, are you doing?  What?  Hey, what you do on your own time...  Whoa, whoa, whoa. Come on, come on, what. You took his underwear?  Okay, now hold on. Joey, why, why can\\'t you just wear the underwear you\\'re wearing now?  Okay, then why do you have to wear underwear tonight?  Just, just, just pick one!  Yeah, pants, what, what an idea. Or better yet, um, how \\'bout you go without any pants. Look, I don\\'t know what you\\'re trying to do to me, but just get your butt in there and pick out any shoes that fit your feet, okay. No, no I don\\'t care if they match. I don\\'t care if they make your ankles or your knees or your earlobes look fat. Okay.  No, no, no just do it. Go in there and pick something out so we can go.  Thank you!  It was, it was her voice.  Yay!  No, no, no, no. Tick, tick, tick, tick.  Um. I know it says black tie optional, but, um this may be pushing it a little, um.  You\\'re not going to go.  How, how, um how can you not be going?  Um, you know, just out of curiosity...  Right. Right, okay, okay. I\\'m sorry. I\\'m sorry I yelled.  No, but, your-your mad.  No.  Your not going.  Okay. You know that I-I have to go.  Right. So is it gonna be like \\'I\\'m abandoning you while your upset.\\'  No, because your not upset.  About the yelling.  Oh, well of course, the humiliating. So, so wee, we\\'re okay.  We\\'re good.  Okay. Honey?  Okay, okay. Enough, enough with the lunging. No! I\\'m sick of this. Okay. I\\'ve had it up to here with you two! Neither you can come to the party!  You know what I don\\'t care. The only person I cared about getting dressed, is the one person that says she\\'s not even gonna go. Look Rach, I\\'m sorry. Okay. Look, I-I wa, I was a jerk. I\\'m sorry I yelled. I want you there, I need you there. Look, what, what can I do that can show you how much, how much I want you to be there.  Hi, welcome, to an adult conversation.  What?  Okay, okay. If that is what it takes to show you how much you mean to me, and how much I want you there. Then that\\'s what I\\'ll do.  You will?!  Well, yeah.  So we\\'re a little late.  What?  Awwww!!!  Wow! What a pleasure.  Hey!  Whoa-whoa-whoa, Knicks season opener tonight. I thought maybe you guys would come over and watch it.  I did give up a career in basketball to become a paleontologist!  Oh, but-but I can’t do it.  Because, because I’ve got Ben.  Of course he is! What, do you think I’d just use my son as-as an excuse? What kind of father do you think I am?  Oh, I’m just over here with Ben. I thought we’d say hi.  And now you want that money back.  I’m sorry you lost your money, but I won it fair and square.  Now, if you wanna try to make some of it back, I’d be glad to play you for it. But I should warn you, I am very good at Cups.  No.  God that is the most beautiful engagement ring ever!  Yeah, you didn’t get one.  Hey!  Oh no, I have plans with Elizabeth.  I’m sorry, it’s just one of my last nights together before she leaves for camp—to be a counselor!  I don’t know.  Wait a minute, does-does everyone feel this way?  Uh-uh—Wow! Uh, I thought you guys were just like making jokes, I had no idea. What you know what? You guys are wrong. Uh yes, there is a chronological age difference but I never notice it. You know why? Because she is very mature. Besides, it doesn’t really matter to me what you guys think. I mean, I’m the one dating Elizabeth, not you!  Yeah, yeah you have the ring?  What’s-what’s going on?  Oh, you have to call the police! That’s what I did to the kids in my building!  Uh, so this play umm, what do you think? It’s-it’s gotten great reviews! Y’know the uh…  Who?  Yeah, I was but uh, she was a little busy with a water balloon fight.  Y’know, maybe she is too young for me. Y’know, when I was over there and she was running around with her friends, I felt like I was a baby-sitter. I finally started to see what you guys were talking about. I don’t know what to do.  Okay umm, bad stuff. Well, I’m-I’m 12 years older than she is.  Hmm.  Okay, good stuff. Umm, well she’s-she’s sweet and pretty and…  No! No! I…didn’t do that. It’s just… Okay, honestly no. I don’t, I don’t see a big future with her.  I’ve got to talk to her. Ugh, I hate this part.  Elizabeth, thank God! I was just thinking about…  What?!  Okay, break-up’s still on!  What happened you guys?  Rach!  Hey, come on in.  Oh, thanks. Yeah, I really thought we’d be able to make it work, but uh, I guess it just wasn’t meant to be.  I guess so.  Right. Ohh! You-you want me to be your backup.  Ohh, yeah I already have one.  Phoebe.  Ohh, I don’t think so.  That’s impossible! I mean we have had a deal for years! We-we-we shook on it, although believe me she wanted to do a lot more than that.  Phoebe, how could you do this to me?!  I was not!  No! Pick me! I don’t want to end up an old maid!  Ooh, I wanna switch to Rachel too!  All right.  You what? Wh what were you doing seeing her boobies?  Alright, alright. We\\'re all adults here, there\\'s only one way to resolve this. Since you saw her boobies, I think, uh, you\\'re gonna have to show her your peepee.  Yeah.  What, so he was a little analytical. That\\'s what he does, y\\'know? C\\'mon, he\\'s not that bad.  Y\\'see, that\\'s where you\\'re wrong. Why would I marry her if I thought on any level thatthat she was a lesbian?  Why? Why would I why? Why? Why? Why?  That that\\'s ridiculous! I don\\'t feel guilty for her failures!  Nonono, thatthat\\'s not what I was saying...  Hey, I married a lesbian to make you look good!  I dunno, there\\'s just something about...  We\\'re sorry, Pheebs, we\\'re sorry.  So Joey, you okay?  I\\'m sorry, it\\'s just... how did you get so tan?  Eh, you got a spray-on tan?  Still, I can\\'t believe that\\'s sprayed on... I mean, it looks really good. I wonder if I should get one!  So, do you get colours or just French tips?  Well... I like how you look, what are you?  Two, I think a two.  Spray, count, pat, then turn, spray, count and pat.  You sprayed my front twice!  No, I barely even got to three Mississippi.  So, how dark is it gonna get?  I\\'m a four?  I went to that tanning place your wife suggested.  I\\'m gonna stop you right there, Glenda. Okay? Does it look like this is my first time, huh? Now I want 4 two\\'s... and I want them all on my back.  Wait a minute, there\\'s two sets of nozzles, which one is it?  Which... which... which... Which one is it?  OH! SON OF A BITCH!  Go away! I don\\'t want to see anybody.  Really? Did you count Mississipily?  Dude, you\\'re not tanned.  Joey, we just saw it!  And it’ll be cool to see it again! Yeah!  Dude, you didn’t say Die Hard. Is everything okay?  Well, John McLane had plans!  What happened?!!  We fell asleep! That is all.  I think that would be best.  Okay. But not about this!  No touch! No touch!  Wow, this cologne really is every bit as good as Georgio.  Just uh, brought back your videos.  No! No we don’t!  I… I don’t know what you are talking about.  I’ve had better.  All right! All right! It was the best nap ever!  I’ve said it! Okay?! But it’s over Joey!  We can’t do it again.  Because it’s weird!  Sure, what do you got?  No, 10 is the highest.  Yes, very nice Rachel.  It is time for you to give your maid of honor speech.  Go!  Yeah, it really was!  I’m sorry Rach, it was, it was really close.  Actually, it wasn’t that close.  Yeah?  Why-why would I care about that?  It really was.  Oh, shhh, shh. Magic is about to happen.  Is it? Feels like two.  What?  Oh. Hel-lo!  He could never get a woman like that in a million years.  C\\'mon! C\\'mon!  Well, y\\'know, monogamy can be a, uh, tricky concept. I mean, anthropologically speaking-  Fine. Fine, alright, now you\\'ll never know.  Alright. There\\'s a theory, put forth by Richard Leakey-  Oh yeah, nobody knows. And we\\'re not supposed to ask.  Oh c\\'mon! When we were kids, yours was the only Raggedy Ann doll that wasn\\'t raggedy!  Alright, you madcap gal. Try to imagine this. The phone bill arrives, but you don\\'t pay it right away.  Because you\\'re a kook! Instead you wait until they send you a notice.  Monica? You\\'re Mom.  C\\'mon, seriously, Joey, what\\'s the part?  You\\'re right, you\\'re right, it is...So you gonna invite us all to the big opening?  Look at it this way: you dumped her. Right? I mean, this woman was unbelievably sexy, and beautiful, intelligent, unattainable... Tell me why you did this again?  No? What happened, big guy?  It felt like a \\'big guy\\' moment.  Yeah, I mean... I think when it\\'s your shot, y\\'know, you-you know it\\'s your shot. Did it... feel like your shot..?  She is a kook.  What’s the matter? You okay?  Okay. Yeah, I guess, I guess I could do that too.  Yeah, I kind of uh, have something else planned for you guys.  Sorry, I’m kinda keeping this one on the Q.T.  What? A brain transplant?!  It’s ridiculous!  Yeah-yeah, help me out here, when you come out of the \"brain transplant,\" you are going to be her?  What?!  Oh well, it sounds to me like your family is ready to uh, rediscover its Scottish roots.  Well yeah-yeah the Scottish history is so much more…  How did you know about that?!  Were you the ones called the cops?!  Why not?  Come on that’s not fair! I mean you haven’t even heard me play!  No, you’ve heard my practice. Okay? Just-just give me a chance to perform for you and then decide whatever you want. And I’m not going to tell you what song I’m gonna play either. But uh, let’s just say when it’s over I’ll bet there will be a we bit o’ celebration.  …now remember you have to imagine me in a kilt.  One, two, three, four!  You know the song! Sing along!  So?  You know the song! Sing along!  Hey!  Right, no, I understand.  Hotel? Why isn\\'t she staying with you guys?  Erica, those things aren\\'t free. In fact they have one of the highest mark-ups of any consumer product...  Oh man, I can\\'t believe you guys are leaving this place.  No, no. This will always be your place. It would be too sad. Plus, how much a month does it cost to feed Joey?  Hey, is Chandler here? We talked about catching a movie.  What are you guys doing?  Chandler, you don\\'t have a sister so you can\\'t understand how much this bums me out.  Bumming hard, guys, bumming hard.  Yeah? Yeah, where is it?  Rock on!  Hey, where\\'s Rach?  Great.  Here she is!  Oh, man! I can\\'t believe she\\'s actually leaving. How am I gonna say goodbye to Rachel?  Yeah?  Hey, what do you think they\\'re doing in there?  Are you kidding? Oh my God...  Well it\\'s okay. Chandler is talking to her.  I don\\'t think so.  Okay, here we go...  Yeah...  Huh?  What? I don\\'t get a goodbye?  Unbelievable. She says goodbye to everyone but me.  Well, it needs to be plicit.  No, I don\\'t think so.  THE HELL I DO!  I don\\'t get a goodbye?  That\\'s what it seemed like.  Fine, then why didn\\'t you say something?  Rach!  You keep, you keep... You can\\'t...  So you two are..?  And have you .. ed?  But if I hadn\\'t walked in here, would you..?  I\\'m not going nuts. Do you see me go nuts?  It\\'s all working out! Me & Charlie, and you two. You know what we should do?  No. We should all have dinner. Yes, we\\'ll do it tomorrow night. I\\'ll cook!!  Underwear, a toothbrush, and Van Halen CD. I can use all these things!!  What? Fine? Because I am! Aren\\'t you? Aren\\'t you? Aren\\'t you? You see? Who else is fine?  You know what? That is a very good idea. I\\'m gonna go make a pitcher of Margaritas.  The first batch of margaritas was not so great, but the second batch is gooooood.  Oh, guys, this is fun, isn\\'t it? You know? Just the four of us. Just hangin\\'.  I\\'m fine! Hey, I\\'m great! I\\'m just.. I\\'m just proud of us. There\\'s no weirdness, no tension.  We make a great foursome. We should do more stuff together. Ooh! Let\\'s take a trip. Okay, where do you think we - we can go?  My fajitas!!  Fajitas! Be careful, very hot plate, very hot plate!!  That is gonna hurt tomorrow!  Everyone? I would like to make a toast to Rachel and Joey.  And to love. Ah, love. L-O-V-E, love. L is for life. And what is life without love?  O is for \"oh, wow!\" The V is for this very surprising turn of events, which I\\'m still fine with by the way. E is for how extremely normal I find it. That you two are together. And now one day you might get married and have children of your own.  Totally.  No!  Wasn\\'t it? And you thought it would be awkward with Joey and that you never really liked Rachel.  Okay.  Okay, I guess it\\'s just flan for three! Hey, hey, that rhymed!  Oh, oh. Of course. God, I\\'m so stupid. You guys are a couple now. I mean, you probably just want to be alone.  Hey, hey, it\\'s fine. It\\'s totally fine. We\\'ve got plenty of margaritas. It\\'s all good.  I don\\'t even know what that\\'s for.  Thanks. Did you stay here all night?  So you took off my pants and shoes?  What do you mean?  Hey, what are you talking about? I\\'m fine!  Except we\\'re not. I mean, we haven\\'t been a couple in like, six years. Oh my god, is that right? Has it been that long?  This is crazy. I mean, six years? And because of me you guys aren\\'t gonna be together? Can I ask you something? Really, what is this thing with you and Rachel?  Joey.  And she feels the same way?  Well, then, maybe it\\'s time we all moved on.  No, but I wanna be. Hey, I will be. Besides, I\\'m with Charlie, right? Oh my god, I\\'m still with Charlie, aren\\'t I? I mean, she didn\\'t see the dance, did she?  Yeah, I\\'m sure.  Hi guys.  Oh, Monica, I figured I\\'d come by tomorrow morning and pick up Fluffy\\'s old cat toy, OK?  Uh, actually, we\\'re getting a cat.  Uh huh.  Yep.  Hopefully.  Hey Rach.  Oh. And how was the date?  Wow, well uh, uh, actually, Julie\\'s downstairs getting a cab, I just need the cat toy, did Monica say. . . What? Why, why are you looking at me like that?  No, I stayed at Julie\\'s last night.  Oh, actually I haven\\'t even been home yet. Do you mind if I check my messages?  You\\'re over me?  Wha... you\\'re uh, you\\'re, you\\'re over me?  When, when were you... under me? Rach. Rachel do you, I mean, were you, uh. . . What?  You\\'ve had feelings for me?  Woah. Huh. You know about my, I mean, you know I had... you know?  Chandler. When did he... when did he... when did he?  China.  Julie. Julie. That. Oh God. Julie, right. OK, I need to lie down. No, ya know, I\\'m gonna stand. I\\'m gonna stand, I\\'m gonna walk, I\\'m walkin\\' and I am standing. OK so you uh, and now wha... and now, now, now you\\'re over me?  Well, OK, I uh, I have to. I can\\'t deal with this right now. I mean, I\\'ve uh, y\\'know, I\\'ve got a cab, I\\'ve got a girlfriend, I\\'m... I\\'m gonna go get a cat.  I didn\\'t get a cat.  No, no it\\'s not interesting. OK, it\\'s very, very not interesting. In fact it\\'s actually 100 percent completely opposite of interesting.  You had no right to tell me you ever had feelings for me.  I was doing great with Julie before I found out about you.  Then you should have said something before I met her.  There was never a good time.  Not, not, not every night. You know, and... and it\\'s not like I didn\\'t try, Rachel, but things got in the way, y\\'know? Like, like Italian guys or ex-fiances or, or, or Italian guys.  The point is I... I don\\'t need this right now, OK. It, it\\'s too late, I\\'m with somebody else, I\\'m happy. This ship has sailed.  Hey, I\\'ve been doin\\' it since the ninth grade, I\\'ve gotten pretty damn good at it.  Fine.  Good.  Try the bottom one.  What are you guys doing later?  Come on guys, I-I really want this guy to like me. It-it would really help me out if you guys were here to make me look good.  Thanks!  It-it’s great to meet you Paul.  Of course, of course, Mr. Stevens.  Eh-wh—Excuse me?  Okay. I can, I can see that. Umm, but I think if you give me umm, one chance I can, I can change your mind.  What?  And the Irish guy wins the joke!  Joey?!  Okay, I’ll just wait for him in here!  What-what-what the—how da-how did-what the-how did-what?!  You were at the coffeehouse!  He is my girlfriend’s father, okay? It’s-it’s, it’s weird!  That was different!  This is weird for me!  How is that important?  Yeah, take your time.  Not all bad.  Yeah. You know what? I know what you mean; I do that too.  No! No! Not—I don’t mean I-I see her as a twelve-year-old girl! I mean I-I have a son, who’s umm six and I still think of him as a baby.  You’re back.  Y’know what? I-I-I… I-I have had enough of this! Y’know, I-I-I care a great deal about your daughter and I have treated her with nothing but respect! So if-if you’ve got a problem with me, frankly…  God no!  That’s okay, I’m not so crazy about myself right now either.  Uh yeah, I guess—Yeah! I guess so.  Ohhh! Kids!  That’s okay Rach, we’re not liking Ross right now.  No! No! No!  Uh actually, I think I\\'m gonna skip it.  Yeah, I\\'m gonna stay and read my book. I just wanna be alone right now.  That\\'s okay, Joe.  Just, y\\'know out.  I uh, went to a bar. And then I just uh, just walked around for a while.  Look, I don\\'t have to answer your questions! Okay? I\\'m a big boy, I can do whatever I want!  Okay, look, I-I know what you guys are going to say…  Okay, I didn\\'t know you would say that.  Look, I didn\\'t lose my mind! Okay, Janice and I have a lot in common! We\\'ve-we\\'ve both been divorced. We-we both have kids.  I am gonna see her again.  Y\\'know what? It sounds so weird to say this but, I just had a great day with Janice!  Thanks!  Are you sure? Because I can stay out as late as you want. I told you how I\\'m on sabbatical from work, right?  Oh…  This isn\\'t what I ordered! Man! Can anything go right in my life?! First my marriage falls apart and then…  Okay. Sometimes I feel…  Huh?  OH…MY…GOD!!  I am now.  Dude, we got to talk.  Well, because y\\'know there are certain rules about this kind of stuff. You don\\'t uh, you don\\'t fool around with your uh, friend\\'s ex-girlfriends or possible girlfriends or girls they\\'re related to.  Okay.  All right.  Hello!  So, how was the honeymoon?  The lie you just told.  There’s the one!  Yes let’s. Y’know what? Uh, it’s-it’s not important. What is important is that, is that we’re having a baby. And it’s not—Doesn’t matter who came on to who.  What? What?! You were begging me to kiss you! You-you-you were sending me signals all over the place!  Yeah!  Y’know what?! It doesn’t matter! It doesn’t matter what you believe! What matters is what happened!  Y’know what? Y’know what? Rachel, just-just drop it.  Okay, listen I am not a pervert!  Filming Rachel is not something I planned. Okay look, here’s what happened, and Joey you-you can back me up on this. All right, about-about a month and a half ago I came to you with a problem? Umm, a personal thing.  Hey!  Do you have a minute? I’d like to talk to you about something I’m, I’m really uncomfortable talking about.  I actually had a topic in mind! I’m, I’m kinda going through a dry spell, sex wise.  Five to be lying, six.  Well, I mean it’s not all bad. I’m learning to appreciate the uh, smaller things in life. Like the sound of a bird and the color of the sky.  Please, help me! I have a date tonight. It has to go well okay—I’m scared for my health!  Really? Well then tell it to me.  It’s from France…In Europe…Western Europe. Y’know umm, a few years ago I actually was backpacking across Western Europe.  Uh-hmm—Wait! It gets better. Um, yeah I was in Barcelona.  Anyway, umm so I was um, I was hiking…  Okay! Do you wanna tell the story?!  Great! I’m across the street having sex with her right now. Your story sucks!  No! No, I don’t…don’t want to.  I was backpacking across Western Europe.  I was just outside Barcelona, hiking…  It’s been six months! I’m always hot!  I’ll try that.  Thanks.  Thanks. And-and hey Joe?  Listen, if you ever have any problem with the ladies you know I’ll help you out.  Hi!  That’s less embarrassing, yes. Yes I was.  What a great idea! That will get Rachel to forgive me!  Joey! No!  Forget it, she’s destroying it.  Look, forget it Phoebe. Okay? It’s Rachel’s tape and she can do whatever she wants with it. And she wants to destroy it. So, end of story.  What?!  I don’t want people to see it for your sake.  Rachel, please…  And in about five seconds you’re gonna see why.  Now I’m so happy.  Hi.  Yeah. Listen about that, the whole uh, who came on to who thing really doesn’t matter. I mean, I think it would’ve happened either way. I mean if you hadn’t initiated it I-I-I know I would’ve.  It was. It was an amazing night.  I uh… I don’t know. I mean I…I honestly didn’t watch it.  Uhhhhhh…that-that may be weird.  Good luck.  Mind if I mute?  Oh, oh there go the clothes.  Six months Rachel, six months.  Hey. We-we look…we look pretty good.  Oh nice tan!  Ah….  I have been working out.  Oh that’s not pretty.  No!  Oh no!  Oh no!!  No!!  No!!!  It was, it was great. Oh, what happened?  You\\'re bleeding.  Well, where do I start? This is Julie. Julie, this is Rachel.  That\\'s all right, Rach, we got the bags. Hi, hello. Julie, this is my sister Monica. This is Chandler.  Phoebe.  Joey, what up?  Everyone, this is Julie.  And bus.   The screaming guy?  You gotta hear this story.  200 at least.  But we haven\\'t seen each other since then. Well I land in China, guess who\\'s in charge of the dig.  Well, we just wanted to say a quick hi, and then we\\'re gonna go see the baby.  Yeah, it\\'s really 6:00 tomorrow night our time.  Hey, Rach, can I get some coffee?  Thank you.  I know, I know I was, but there was always this little voice inside that kept saying it\\'s never gonna happen, move on. You know whose voice that was?  It was you, pal.  Look, you were right. She looks at me and sees a friend, that\\'s all. But then I met Julie, and I don\\'t know, we\\'re havin\\' a great time. And I have to say, I never would\\'ve gone for it with her if it hadn\\'t been for you.  I didn\\'t order lemonade.  But...  Ironically, these are the guys who were picked last in gym.  Ok, no, no, you hang up. You, you, y...  Rachel! I\\'ll just call her back.  Hi. Sorry we\\'re late but we were—well, there was touching.  Hey, Paulo. What are you doing here?  No, not a problem.  How\\'s the hair?  What?  What?  Yes, yes it is. In prison! Whatsa matter with you?  Well, I gotta go. Bye. Bye, Rach.  Yeah, that\\'s kinda what I meant by \"bye!\"  What\\'s goin\\' on?  Ok. Well, before I say anything, I just need to know, is this one of those things where you break up with a guy, and then I tell you what I think, and then the next day you get back together with the guy, and I look like a complete idiot?  Well, then, I think, I think the guy is scum. I hate him. I mean I actually—I-I physically hate him. I always have. You are way too good to be with a guy like that.  Oh, right, because he\\'s a scientist!  Ok, we gotta go, yeah? So, we\\'ll see you guys tomorrow.  It\\'s a blanket Joe, not a cloak of invisibility!  Wow! This is very flattering, uh...  \"... Sarah. I dig you\", Uh? \"Doctor Ross Geller\".  Yeah, oh and Sarah... I\\'d like to introduce you to my colleague, uh, Professor Wheeler, a-and this is Joey Tribbiani.  Dude, it\\'s just \"Days of Our Lives\"... there\\'s no the.  Hey!  Yeah... what am I going to say to Kenneth Schwartz?  Yeah.  Uh, Joe, have you looked outside?  By using CT scans and computer imaging we can in a very real way, bring the Mesozoic era into the 21st century.  The chocolates aren\\'t here yet.  What, oh my God. What did you do?  Why, why would you open it?  What did it say?  What... what am I gonna do? My speech is gone, Chandler!  NO! I don\\'t!!  Yep! I\\'d like to thank you guys for coming down here to complain about the rain and ruin my career!  Yeah, well you should! I mean, nude pictures of Anna Kournikova? I mean, she\\'s never even won a major tournament!  Well, what do you do?  I can\\'t believe this. I can\\'t believe this is happening. I have to give the keynote speech tomorrow! Ok? I have to stand up in front of all these people. What am I gonna say?  I don\\'t think that your monologue from Star Wars is gonna help me right now, Joe!  Wha... what you really think we can do that?  Yeah, that\\'s it?  Oh my God, I love you.  That\\'s Ben, my son from my first marriage.  Yeah.  Ok, odd thing to get excited about!  My wife had a workout friend she went to the gym with everyday for a year. She didn\\'t get any fitter.  I know! It\\'s like, if you knew, why didn\\'t you tell me, you know? I mean, call, or leave a note: \"Hi, I just dropped by to say your wife\\'s gay\"  And then, you try to make the best of a bad situation, so you float the idea of a threesome?  Good night.  Then we have to await the data from recent MRI scans and DNA testing which call into question information gathered from years of simple carbon dating.  Finally, factoring the profusion of new species recently discovered: Gigantosaurus, Argentinasaurus...  And that\\'s just the herbivores. I\\'m not even gonna discuss the carnivores, their heads are already too big. Which is ironic considering their stunted cerebral development.  ... and while there are certainly vast differences between these Mesozoic fossiles and the example of Homo erectus...  Oh, thanks guys!  Oh!  Oh, thank you so much!  Yeah?  No, it\\'s ok! Made me feel like a rock star!  Get Out!  Oh my God, wh-what happened?  I knew that was him!  Oh, professor Clerk we\\'re kind of in the middle of a conversation, here.  Hi.  I don\\'t think they saw us.  I think I know too but I\\'ve been really wrong about this stuff in the past, so...  I\\'m sorry... we... we can\\'t.  Hey, how’d the date go with Mr. Millionaire?  Still?!  I guess he musta gotten the part in that play.  So Rachel called. Wants to see me. Going over in a minute.  Well, maybe the crazy fog has lifted and she realises that life without me.... a-sucks.  Then be supportive like a guy.  Hi.  You ah, wanted to see me?  What?!  What are you doing? Are you trying to hurt me? Or something?  Yes.  Yes, I do.  It’s still a gift! I got it from the gift shop!  I’m just trying to help you, move on.  Petty...  Petty...  Petty...  Awwwahuh, no, no, no!!  Oh, yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah...  You bug me.  I knew it! I knew it! I always knew she liked him! Y\\'know, she’d say no, but here we are! Right? We just broke up, first thing she does!  Hey, it’s been like three weeks!  She’s going in. Wait! He’s going in! He’s going in!! The door’s closed! I, I can’t see anything but the door closed!!  Okay, I have to do something. I mean, I have, I have to stop it!  I don’t know, but I ah, I have the feeling that my being there will do it. I’ll go over and I will borrow something. Juice!! I need juice!!  Look, they must be stopped!  I need juice! People need juice!!  People need juice!  Juice, I need...  Yeah, okay.  It’s just I miss her so much.  Hey, if mommy can have a wife, daddy can have a bra.  Oh, no-no-no, see, that-that clock’s a little fast, uh, we have 17 minutes. Huh, what can we do in 17 minutes? Twice?  Hey, uh, you can ignore that.  Uhh, believe me when he’s older, he’ll understand.  Look at you two, bonding, making us late for the airport so…  Oh come on! That’s-that’s… true.  Hey!  So uh, Emily called last night…  Turns out them Emily is just crazy about Susan. Yeah, they’re going to the theatre together! They’re going to dinner! They’re going horseback riding!  Look, this is just a little too familiar, okay? For like, for like six months before Carol and I spilt up, all I heard was: \"My friend Susan is so smart. My friend Susan is so funny. My friend Susan is so great.\"  Hey, they’re going to the gym together! Two women! Stretching! Y’know they-they take a steam together! Things get a little playful—didn’t you see Personal Best?  How do you know? I mean we thought Carol was straight before I married her!  What a weird way to kick me when I’m down.  Oh. What’s wrong with Ross?  So umm, any word from Susan?  Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Uh, by the by, did it uh, did it ever occur to you that, I don’t know, maybe they might be having a little too much fun?  Y’know, the kind of fun, you and Susan had when we were married.  Am I?!  Am I?!  Uh-huh, Carol, so were we. All right, just-just imagine for a moment, Susan meets someone and-and they really hit it off. Y’know? Say-say they’re coming back from the theatre, and they-they stop at a pub for a couple of drinks, they’re laughing, y’know, someone innocently touches someone else… There’s electricity, it’s new. It’s exciting. Are you telling me there isn’t even the slightest possibility of something happening?  OH MY GOD!! I didn’t really believe it until you just said it!!  So! Poetry? Susan’s gay! They’re being gay together!  Oh, wake up!  Excuse me?  Look, I don’t know what you’re talking about, I am not a crazy, jealous person.  What?  It does not!  This is not fun!  Well, I still think I was right about that whole Mark thing.  Nice luggage.  Hi!  Oh, I missed you too.  You\\'re welcome for a delicious dinner.  I know!  Actually she\\'s a paleontology doctoral candidate, specializing in the centazoic era.  I\\'ve seen her at work, but I always figured, ah-huh? But, uh, I made her dinner. We had a great time. And we\\'re going out again tomorrow.  Fine by me; hope she wins.  How do you think it\\'s gonna look when you get her something incredibly meaningful and expensive and her boyfriend Joey gives her an orange?  So, uh, why did you have to turn it down?  Did homo-erectus hunt with wooden tools?  Mitzi is.....  Well, I do! Why don\\'t we go back to my place, light a couple of candles, break open a box of Cinnamon Fruit Toasties, uh...  Oh, yeah, why not?  You know how you throw your jacket on a chair at the end of the day?  What do you mean? Nothing happened! I had to get out of there.  No, I tried that. She says it has a weird smell.  I don\\'t know. Soap?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, okay you\\'re right.  I mean, uh, who... who cares about a little sloppiness?  It\\'s, uh... it\\'s endearing, really.  Department of Sanitation?  Oh my god! I\\'m so sorry, Cheryl. I must have freaked out.  Don\\'t be silly. Ben loves you. He\\'s just being Mr. Crankypants.  Come on, don\\'t do this.  I don\\'t know. What\\'s in this pie?  Kiwi? Kiwi? I thought it was a key lime pie.  And that\\'s what\\'s gonna kill me. I\\'m allergic to kiwi.  Ugh.  Ugh. It\\'s definitely getting worse.  Either that or my mouth is getting smaller.  You know, you know, actually it\\'s getting better. It is. It is. Let\\'s not go. Anyone for Thcrabble?  What about Ben? We can\\'t bring a baby to a hospital.  I don\\'t think tho.  Ok, well, if you do take him out for his walk, you might wanna bring his hat, and there\\'s extra milk in the fridge, and there\\'s extra diapers in the bag.  Well, there\\'s no way I\\'m gonna get a shot. Maybe they can take the needle and thquirt it into my mouth, you know, like a thquirt gun.  Did you tell him about my thquirt gun idea?  Tho?  Ohhh.  Ok.  Oh, I\\'m sorry, I\\'m really sorry. Sorry. Sorry! Hey! Hey! I got my s\\'s back! Which we can celebrate later. Celebrate.  I just wanna thank you for being there for me today. And I\\'m sorry I,I almost broke your hand.  Yeah. Hey, remember the time I jammed that pencil into your hand?  Oh.  Oh, man. Oh, remember when I stuck that broom in your bike spokes, and you flipped over and hit your head on the curb?  I hope Ben has a little sister.  I\\'m gonna get a new band-aid. Hey, how \\'bout the time I cut the legs off your Malibu Ken?  They, uh, were infected. He wouldn\\'t have made it.  I\\'m here. How\\'s my little boy? Want Daddy to change your diaper? So, did you have fun with Uncle Joey and Uncle Chandler today?  Ohhh. Big boy, riding the bus--Hey, I have a question. How come it says Property of Human Services on his butt?  Will you hold Ben for a sec? Come here. Come here.  Okay, okay take a guess.  People are doing it in front of my book!  My doctoral dissertation is in the library at school, I went to see it, and there were students makin’ babies right in the middle of the Paleontology section!  Let me ask you something, at your school was there a like uh a place on campus where students went to uh, fool around.  Great! Because people kept showing up, I think it’s like uh-a thing!  Excuse me. Hi, I’m a professor here. Do you know the Paleontology section, fifth floor, stack 437?  Hi, I was wondering if it is possible to increase security in the Paleontology section? See I-I wrote a book up there and instead of reading it people are-are-are well, rolling around in front of it.  Yes? Yes?! How can I help you?  I find Marion’s views far to progressionist.  I’m a professor here uh, Ross…Geller.  Yes! You’re the person who checked out my book?!  Well I uh, I skipped forth grade.  I am very…very sorry.  So I told Carl, ‘Nobody, no matter how famous their parents are, nobody is allowed to climb on the dinosaur.’ But of course this went in one ear and out.....  Hey. When you guys were kids and you played Happy Days, who were you? I was always Richie.  We?  Oh shoot, tomorrow’s not so good, I’m supposed to um, fall off the Empire State building and land on a bicycle with no seat. Sorry.  Please, he refers to me as ‘wethead’.  Fine.  Hi Gunther.  What?  Come on! That’s great.  Y’know your probably not allowed to sleep with any of your students.  Nice to see you again Dr. Green.  Ugh, museum.  There never was a library. I mean there are libraries, its just that I ah, I never worked at one.  It’s not a library...  So, Dr. Green, how’s the old boat.  It gives it a nice antiquey look.  That’s Daddy?! But doesn’t it bother you? You’re a waitress.  So?  You really serve people sneezers?  Thanks again, Dr. Green.  Oh, ah, you don’t need that.  The carbon, it’s messy, I mean it gets on your fingers and causes, the, the ah, night blindness.  Oh, yeah, that would be me, um, I have, I have a problem I-I tip way too much, way, way, too much, it’s a sickness really.  I know.  Nothing I do means anything, really.  Well Mr. Big Shot is better than ‘wethead’.  Four percent. Okay. I tip more than that when there’s a bug in my food.  Yeah, I’m gonna go to a doctor who went to school in a mini-mall.  Hey Pheebs, what are you doing?  Look, honey, I have tried to make nice, it doesn’t work.  Look sweetie, I could be the bigger man, I could be the biggest man, I could be a big, huge, giant man, and it still wouldn’t make any difference, except that I could pick your Father up and say ‘Like me! Like me tiny doctor!’  Rachel one brunch is not gonna solve anything. You gotta face it, okay we’re never gonna get along.  Thank you for teaching me a valuable lesson.  Look, look I’m sorry. It’s just that....  Thank you! That’s what I keep saying.  Uh.  And his first name.  Oh-ho please. Ask her how?  Argue with that.  I know that!  What can I do, she doesn’t listen to me about renter’s insurance either.  Hey, would you ah, would you like some juice?  Excellent!  Monica’s pregnant!  What?! What do you mean? You-you-you’re not pregnant?  Hi. I’m uh, I’m Ross. I don’t, I don’t believe we’ve met. I’m Monica’s older brother.  Aw come on, Mona Lisa?  Mona umm…Clickclocken. The famous botanist? Huh? Oh no she’s uh—well she’s dead now. No, supposedly she was once quite the hottie of the plant world.  Hey! Uh, I thought, I thought you were at table six.  Umm, would you like to dance?  Yeah?  Oh umm, well uh, maybe-maybe later. Right now, I’m about to dance with this lady.  Uh, unless! Unless, uh this lady wouldn’t mind letting you go first.  Yes I-I am. In fact umm hey, why don’t we try it my special way? You can dance on my feet.  Keep dancing.  No-no, thank you Miranda.  Oh-oh, were you, were you watching?  What? Of course you can! Hop on!  I am so gonna score.  I like your bow.  I just didn’t see the fast song coming.  Oh, thank you.  Monica, uh Dad called this morning and ah, Aunt Silvia passed away.  We were all pretty shaken up about it.  Well ah, Aunt Silvia was, well not a nice person.  You get the dollhouse.  Wait a minute, the house was built on radioactive waste, and an ancient Indian burial ground? That would never happen.  Sure, what’s up?  Uh, Pheebs, while we’re hovering around the subject. I just have to say dinosaurs, they-they don’t go, rrroof!  Hey, what’s this?!  This is the coolest house ever!!  I would!  Hi.  Hi.  It’s a little early to be drinkin’.  Ohhhhh!  Mon?  Oh, fire!

Actually it\\'s the movie theatre that has the time schedule. So you don\\'t miss the beginning.  Excuse me, your, your, your wind?  You, you know I, I don\\'t, have a- have a problem with that.  I, I don\\'t know, it\\'s got all this stuff about wind and trees and there\\'s some kind of sacred pool in it. I mean, I don\\'t really get it but she\\'s, she\\'s pretty upset about it.  What, what\\'s that?  Open it, open in.  Woah.  Uh Joey, that\\'s just the minumum amount due, that\\'s your total due.  What, woah, woah, $3500 at porcelain safari?  Well I guess you can start by drivin a cab on Another World.  That audition.  Joey, you owe $1100 at I Love Lucite.  So suck it up man, it\\'s a job, it\\'s money.  Toilet paper?  Look, I\\'m not being any of those things, ok, I\\'m just being realistic.  I am your friend.  But I don\\'t know it. What I do know is that you owe $2300 at Isn\\'t it Chromantic.  Ok, well then get some sense. I mean it took you what, 10 years to get that job, who knows how long it\\'s gonna be till you get another.  Huh, I\\'m just saying...  Ya know, maybe, maybe I should just go.  Ok. I\\'ll see ya later. Just think about it, ok.  No look I wasn\\'\\'t right, that\\'s what I came here to tell you. I was totally hung up on, on my own stuff. Listen, I\\'m someone who needs the whole security thing, ya know. To know exactly where my next paycheck is coming from buy you, you don\\'t need that and that\\'s amazing to me. I could never do what you do Joey.  Yeah. And you should hold out for something bigger. I can\\'t tell you how much respect I have for you not going to that stupid cab driver audition.  Great, how did it go?  Good for you.  You\\'re livin\\' the dream.  All right then.  What?  Dollars? You spent $1200 dollars on a plastic bird?  Go ahead, go ahead with the bird. Ok, do you have anything for around 200?  Huh.  I\\'ll take it. My gift to you man.  Nono, me neither. Although, uh, y\\'know, back in college, Susan Sallidor did.  No. No, it\\'s just \\'cause, uh, I kinda wanted to go out with her too, so I told her, actually, you were seeing Bernie Spellman... who also liked her, so...  So, uh, how\\'s she doing?  Okay, relax, relax. We are gonna be here for a while, it looks like, and we still have boyfriends and your career to cover.  Oh! ...Yeah, they were gross. Oh, you know what I loved? Her Sweet \\'n\\' Los. How she was always stealing them from- from restaurants.  She looks so small.  Well, at least she\\'s with Pop-Pop and Aunt Phyllis now.  Bye, Nana.  Y\\'know how-how the nurse said that-that Nana had passed? Well, she\\'s not, quite..  She\\'s not- past, she\\'s present, she\\'s back.  Now she\\'s passed.  Twice.  I dunno, it\\'s weird. I mean, I know she\\'s gone, but I just don\\'t feel, uh...  Nono, she\\'s gone.  I thought it was gonna be a closed casket.  Here\\'s my retainer!  I have shown you everything we have. Unless you want your mother to spend eternity in a lemon yellow pant-suit, go with the burgundy.  And where she\\'s going everyone else\\'ll be dressier?  No! Nonono, wait a sec. I may have something in the back.  Oh my God..  Yeah, just... just Nana stuff.  Some days it\\'s all I can think about.  What, we-uh- we don\\'t have shoes here, or...?  Oh, I hope they\\'re not ruined.  I\\'m fine. Just-just... having my worst fear realised...  What, what is it?  Oh! No-n-  I feel great. I feel- great, I fleel great.  ...Chandler!  No.  That little naked guy would be me.  Yes, yes, fine, that is my penis. Can we be grown-ups now?  Got me.  Listen, I-I need a favor. Umm, I was in the shower, and as I was cleansing myself, I ah, I-I, well I felt something.  No, no, I mean, I mean a thing on my body.  Well, eww. What? Is it a pimple?  Ahhh.  Well, he said there\\'s definitely nothing to worry about, it\\'s totally benign.  He couldn\\'t even tell me! He said it was just some sort of skin... abnormality. And the worst thing is he-he-he said, he said, without being able to identify it, he was reluctant to remove it.  At least they knew what yours was. Y\\'know, yours had a name.  Th-th-that\\'s all it is, a third nipple. Y\\'know? Just your run-of-the-mill third nipple. Y\\'know? You can take it off. Just slice that baby right off!  Just showing you my run-of-the-mill-slice-it-right-off third nipple.  No?  Well then, what is it?!  Y\\'know I have dinner plans!!  Yes, and the dimmer switch.  Hey, you gotta get Mom on the phone. Call Mom! Call Mom!  Monica’s right. We’re talking about getting married here. Okay? She-she can’t just rush into this.  Thank you, but I want to remove it Pheebs. I don’t want to make it savory.  Hi.  Listen, I got to tell you I’ve-I’ve never been to a guru before, so...  What’s a koondis?  I guess it’s worth a try.  What?! What?!  We?! We angered it?!  Oh God!  Ow!!  What was, what was that?  What?! How’s that?  Thank you.  Boy, we uhm... hadn\\'t really thought of that.  And she\\'s a little mannish...  Oh, come on, Rach, he\\'s a guy!  Because, it\\'s weird!  What kind of job is that for a man? A nanny? I-It\\'s like if a woman wanted to be...  King?  You gotta be at least bi...  Do you realise that man has cried in our apartment three times...? Huh? I haven\\'t cried that many times since I moved in.  Hey... there\\'s sensitive... and there is too sensitive.  Did Rachel tell you we hired a male nanny?  Oh really? Did she tell you he plays the recorder, recites poetry and bakes Madeleines?  Hey...! Rachel and I hired a male nanny.  Thank you!  ...a what? A what? What\\'s the end of that sentence?  Wow!  Science...? Academia...? Being a good father...?  Yep! That\\'s my thing...  Really? Sounded like Three Blind Mice.  Okay, okay... How exactly is a two month old supposed to appreciate puppets?  Oh, I\\'m sorry. Please apologise to Sandy and the Snufflebumps for me.  Well, you know what... I-I\\'m sorry I\\'m the only one who isn\\'t in love with Gary Poppins out there... But I just... I can\\'t... I can\\'t go through with this.  No! Hey, you know what? I\\'m sorry. I would never force you... to hire someone you were this uncomfortable with...  Thank you!  Here goes...  Sandy... Hi, we uhm... we kinda need to talk. I\\'m afraid it\\'s not working out.  Yeah, uhm... I mean, Rachel and I, think you are great... with Emma... uhm... We just feel...  I... just feel that the... the chemistry isn\\'t right. I\\'m sorry. We\\'re... we\\'re more than happy to give you good recommendation...  Anyway, uhm...Well, I\\'m glad there\\'s no hard feelings.  No, you know, it\\'s uhm... nothing you did, it\\'s... it\\'s uhm... my issue.  You know, I\\'m just not uhm... that comfortable with a guy who\\'s as sensitive as you.  I mean, uhm... you know when I was growing up he was kind of a tough guy... You know a-a-and as a kid I wasn\\'t the athlete I am now.  I play squash...! Anyway, uhm... I uhm... I always get the feeling he thought I was too sensitive.  It was hard... I remember... I was in my bedroom... playing with my dinosaurs... playing and learning... and my father walks in and says... he says... \"What are you doing with those things? What\\'s wrong with you, why aren\\'t you... why aren\\'t you outside playing like a... like a real boy?  Here come some more...  What? What\\'s on your shoulder?  No, sorry I don\\'t. Tell me why would anyone pay someone to scar their body for life? What if it doesn\\'t come out right Phoebe? Then it\\'s like, I don\\'t know, havin\\' a bad hair cut all the time. Why\\'s everyone staring at me?  I don\\'t know, I don\\'t think mom and dad would mind. Remember when you were 9 and Richard was 30, how dad used to say, \\'God I hope they get together.\\'  Alright, shall we?  Hi ma.  Uh, actually mom, I think Monica thanked him for the both of us.  Dad, you really don\\'t want to do that.  Dad, I beg you not to finish that sentence.  Mon, Mon, are you OK?  Yeah.  Eww.  Ohh.  Mom, there are so many people in my life. Some of them are seeing people and some of them aren\\'t. Is that crystal?  You got a tattoo?  Well it\\'s really. . . sexy. I wouldn\\'t have thought it would be but. . . wow.  Yeah, so uh, is it sore or can you do stuff?  Hey, let\\'s bring the rest of these down to the truck.  Because I am bored...Out of my mind. I’ve already been to the bank, post office, and the dry cleaners.  Hey, I am not unemployed. I’m on sabbatical!  So what, we just sit?  I\\'m sorry, man. Hey, y\\'know what you should do? You should make something happen for yourself. Y\\'know, like-like write a play. Write a movie! Huh? I mean, what about those Good Will Hunting guys?  Or that.  I\\'ll help you. Yeah, I\\'ll make up a schedule and make sure you stick to it. And plus, it\\'ll give me something to do.  Yeah!  And it can\\'t be Joey.  Or Joseph.  This is helping your career?! Huh? I thought you wanted to be an actor not the creator of crazy lawsuit game!  So Pheebs, are you gonna go back out there or what?  Oh-oh, yeah.  Uh, you weighted 200 pounds.  Yeah, not since I got too strong for you.  Yeah.  Oh fine.  Joey\\'s not going.  Because tomorrow he\\'s redoing yesterday\\'s pages.  I think he\\'s been relaxing enough, thanks to you and Fireball.  I am not unemployed. I\\'m on sabbatical!  And the reason I\\'m doing this is because I am Joey\\'s friend. And if you were a good friend, you\\'d be doing the same thing.  If it does? Then you\\'re an amazing friend of mine.  No you didn\\'t. You said you would, but you never did!  Hey, if they have a ball maybe you can stick razor blades in it and teach them a new game, Gonna Need Stitches Ball.  Yay!  I guess when you don\\'t have so many distractions, it\\'s easier for you to focus. Huh?  Hey man.  About yesterday, I was really wrong. I am sorry.  Hey, you\\'re not naked! So hey, Rach, when will we expect to see you tonight?  Bye! Hey, I hope Emma isn\\'t making it too hard on you.  Yeah?  Yeah, that\\'ll do it.  I\\'m, I\\'m okay.  Sure, I mean, do I wish me and Rachel living together would have worked out? Of course. You know, I\\'m disappointed, but it\\'s not like it\\'s a divorce.  No, it\\'s not a divorce, it is not a divorce! Anyway, I think Rachel and I need to, you know, get on with our lives, maybe, maybe start seeing other people.  Yeah, sure, why not? In fact, if you know anyone that would be good for me...  Yeah? Any names come to mind?  Excuse me, is there a woman waiting at the bar? Someone average height, dark hair, perhaps doing a puzzle?  Well, if I\\'m still here in an hour, buy him a drink on me.  Nah, I don\\'t know if I should. I don\\'t wanna be drunk when I go home alone.  Yeah, it\\'s no big deal. It\\'s just a blind date.  No!  Eh, if it was meant to be, it\\'s meant to be.  Wow, free crab cakes. Well, that\\'s nice. Although I was hoping to have sex tonight.  Just the crab cakes.  What\\'s - what\\'s going on?  What? You - you\\'re making money off my misery?  This is unbelievable. I - I have never been so insulted in my life. Now, if you\\'ll wrap up my free crab cakes, I\\'ll be on my way.  Hey, what\\'s wrong?  Oh. Crab cake?  Well, what happened?  Monica told me you had a blind date.  I did, too.  But is it technically a date if the other person doesn\\'t show up?  Why does everyone keep saying that?  That bad?  Female body inspector? What size is that?  The first date we\\'ve had in months, and they were both such disasters.  Wait a minute; you don\\'t think it was intentional? I mean, that\\'s just stupid.  I know. A double blind date, and we both get stood up. What are the chances?  What? How come that you don\\'t have to go!  Hey!  Hey, you guys won\\'t believe what I have to do for work today.  It\\'s I just know they\\'re gonna be a couple of windbags wearing tweed jackets with suede elbow patches.  Hi, hi, I\\'m Ross Geller.  Oh, oh, that\\'s, that\\'s, that\\'s nice.  Oh, no, it\\'s no big deal, I mean, if I weren\\'t doing this I\\'d just, you know, be at the gym working out.  Oh, ha, I wrote that in one minute.  I don\\'t think so.  You know what, he\\'s a big boy, I\\'m sure he\\'ll find us, ok?  Oh, damn it!  So basically all nuts?  I\\'ve lost the will to live.  What?  Yeah, Charlie is gonna be joining my department.  Oh my God, she\\'s great! I mean, we-we have so much in common and she\\'s just cool, and funny...  Really? Wh-what\\'s wrong?  I\\'m sorry, Rachel, this is Charlie Wealer, she\\'s a collegue.  No, I arranged that...  Ooh... so sad... Still, it can\\'t be easy for you to leave Harvard? Especially after working alongside a Nobel Prize winner like Albert Wintermeyer?  You... you dated Albert Wintermeyer?  Eh, you think? I mean, you went out with a guy who improved the accuracy of radiocarbon dating by a factor of 10!  Who is intimidating to a guy who won the Nobel Prize?  Oh my God! Have you ever been in a relationship with someone who hasn\\'t won the Nobel Prize?  Oh yeah? no, no Nobel Prizes for him?  She... she only dates geniuses and Nobel Prize winners. Oh my God, at the chinese restaurant earlier today, I put chopsticks in my mouth and pretented to be a woolly mammoth.  Nice to meet you.  Oh, I\\'m no actor, I\\'m a professor of palaeontology.  Oh, well no, but I mean, she only goes out with really, really smart guys.  I\\'d lead with that.  Just some boys gave me their phone numbers.  It\\'s actually a 1,000,000$ prize.  Yeah, maybe. I do have my whole career in front of me. I mean, I can still win a Nobel prize. Although the last two papers I\\'ve written were widely discredited.  And sexy.  Yeah, you\\'re right, thanks Pheebs, I\\'m gonna go find her.  I\\'m smarter than him!  That is why!  Yeah, I thought we\\'d be groomsmen, but wouldn\\'t they have asked us by now? When did they ask you to be their bridesmaid?  I wanna say it\\'s not looking good.  Oh, man!  FOOTBALL!  I can\\'t believe we\\'re gonna be the only people that aren\\'t in this wedding.  And it\\'s a wedding! It\\'d be weird if I\\'m not in it...  Who cares, AND?  I\\'ll do it!  Please, you\\'re going down!  Is that what they say on the Figure Skating Team?  So, what did you decide?  Hey!  Where\\'s Rach?  You haven\\'t by any chance chosen a groomsman yet, have you?  I\\'m not! I\\'m making it easier! Pick me!  Listen, listen. Whoever you pick is gonna walk down the aisle with you! Now, I promise I won\\'t say a word, but if you pick Chandler he\\'s gonna be whispering stupid jokes in your ear the whole time!  Oh, I will.  Wait a minute, I know why I\\'m being such an ass, why are you?  I\\'m not supposed to tell you!  What? A dog? No! Rachel gets to choose.  No, but Chandler, hello... Aren\\'t you scared of dogs?  Uhm, ministers don\\'t ride the subway for free.  I\\'ll...  It\\'s the dog.  Uh Joey...  Chappy\\'s heart rate has slowed way down.  Come on Chappy, do your business. MAKE! MA-AKE! I did not sign on for this.  Why, why, why would you dream that?  I love it, when we share.  I can\\'t belive you two had sex in her dream.  Pheebs, why would you want to operate a drill press?  Oh, it\\'s my new beeper.  No, it\\'s for when Carol goes into labor. She can get me wherever I am. I mean, all she has to do is to dial 55-JIMBO.  College?  Oh, oh. Oh, oh. Oh this is it. Oh my god it\\'s baby time. Baby time.  Oh, oh Chandler...  \\'The hills were alive with the sound of music.\\'  Was there...uh, huh, huh, huh... andybody, anybody else there.  You\\'re sure? Nobody uh, handed out uh, mints or anything?  Huh!  Are you not seeing him anymore?  Oh, yeah.  It\\'s morphin time!  Oh, Carol and I have a new system. If she punches in 911, it means she\\'s having a baby, otherwise I just ignore it.  Oh, well this morning he got a call from who I think was our cousin Nathan, and frankly, it was a little more than I needed to know.  I thought that was just a rumour.  Are you\\'re hands still wet?  I\\'m here.  Ooh, Ooh.  I\\'m hurt.  Monica, let\\'s go. Come on now people, woman in labor.  Yeah, save it for the cab, okay.  What are you doing? We\\'re going to a hospital.  Joey, get out of the fridge.  Save it.  Monica, come on now. Let\\'s go, baby coming.  That\\'s nice. Get out Let\\'s go, come on.  Ah, the heart of every healthy relationship. Honesty, respect, and sex with celebrities.  Spiderman?  Thank you.  Well I-I-I, that kind of thing requires some serious thought. First, I’ll divide my perspective canidates into catergories....  Hey.  Okay, I’ve got three of my five.  Celebrities I’m allowed to sleep with.  Yeah, it’s hard okay, I only have two spots left.  Okay, Elizabeth Hurely....  Susan Sarandon.  And!! Isabella Rosselini.  Oh, yeah, well y\\'know Chandler printed it up on his computer.  That would be me.  Hey, it’s my list.  Okay!! Okay!!  Heavy thing, not getting lighter!  Damn! I can’t believe I took her off my list.  Yeah, maybe.  What you don’t think I’d go up to her?  Yeah, well missy, you better be glad that list is laminated.  Okay, hold my crawler.  Oh no, no, no, wait, wait, Isabella. Don’t, don’t just dismiss this so fast. I mean this is a once in a lifetime opportunity...  Um, yeah.  Um, no.  But, okay.  Um, see, but that’s not the final draft.  What?  So you guys, who else did you tip with cookies?  Yeah, but not very well, unless 14-across, \\'Gershwin musical\\' actually is bitemebitemebitemebiteme.  Hey guys.  Hey guys.  Um, just some presents.  I got some, uh, hers and hers towels for Susan and Carol. And, uh, I got this blouse for mom.  Yeah?  Uh, Macy\\'s, third floor, home furnishings.  Hey, anyone hear from Phoebe yet?  Yeah, what\\'re you guys doin\\' here, aren\\'t you supposed to be Christmas shopping?  Hey, Rach, you know what? I think, I think I know what\\'ll make you feel better. How \\'bout you make a list about me.  C\\'mon Rachel.  See there, you uhh, alright, ya, you did what I said.  C\\'mon, just tell me, please, please.  Sure. By the way, there\\'s a difference between being obsessive and. . .  No, no, I was turnin\\' the knob and, and. . . here it is.  It uhh, it won\\'t go back.  Oh, oh that\\'s right, I forgot about your ability to fuse metal.  OK, tip the man.  Hey, here\\'s a theme: Come on in, live like bacon.  Monica, Monica, your guest are turning into jerky, OK.  Alright, alright, here\\'s the chance. Monica give him cash, Rachel give him your earrings. Something, now, anything.  No no, no, that, that\\'s your Christmas tip, alright. Oh, hey, do you think there\\'s a chance you could fix that radiator now?  Yeah.  You mean hardball?  Excuse me, I\\'m seizing. Mr. Treeger, here\\'s another 50, happy Hanukkah. Will uh, will this help with the knob getting?  Hey, Phoebs, how\\'d it go.  Are you OK?  You got me a cola drink?  Well this, this is too much, I feel like I should get you another sweater.  Well, well, they\\'re good.� It\\'s been a while since I\\'ve seen you like this.� You, you clean up good.  Oh, it\\'s fine.� Actually, I, I invited Mike over.  Yeah.  We don\\'t.� But I thought it would be nice to get to know him.� You know, maybe have a little dinner, drinks, conversation.  I don\\'t know.� But, you know, we, we have a lot in common, you know.� He plays piano; I played keyboards in college.� He\\'s been divorced; I have some experience in that area.  Rach, Rach, we\\'ll be fine, all right?� You go have fun.  So . . .� Welcome.  I got bottled breast milk.  You know, I, I used to, ah, play keyboards in college.  No.  Um . . . ah . . . you know, I\\'m divorced.� Um, Phoebe, ah . . . Phoebe said you . . . You\\'ve been divorced?  Yeah.  Shouldn\\'t the pizza be here by now?� I mean, they said thirty minutes or less.� Well, how long has it been?  I do.� I do.� Although, it\\'s actually a lager.  I don\\'t know.� We could look it up.  So soon?  Okay.� Well, thanks, ah, thanks for the beer.  Ah yeah.� Good times.  Uh, hi.  Maybe you should look up \"fascinating.\"  Oh, you know . . . we just drank some beer and Mike played with the boundaries of normal social conduct.  Rachel, lock the door.� Lock the door,� seriously.  So, ah . . . So, how was it?�� Uh, did you guys. . . Did you guys have a good time?  Uh-huh, that\\'s why they call it Staten Island.  Are you serious?!  Wow! We are pretty good at this! Hey! We totally forgot about lunch!  You bought Shawn Cassidy!  What-what is it?!  Why is it inside out?!  How much did you pay for that?  Yeah? How much?  ON A CAT??!!!!  Free cats do that too, y\\'know. {Which reminds me, if I might get a little political here, support your local animal shelter. Pet shops are not the place to buy dogs and cats from, you get a much better deal from the shelter, plus they probably won\\'t die on you in a week and a half. If you want a leash, go to the pet shop. If you want the dog for that leash, go to the shelter and save it\\'s life. Now back to regularly scheduled programming.}  Yeah?  Uhh, yeah it would! Let\\'s do it!  What?  …now when they found the remains of the Mesozoic Mastodon they discovered what appeared to be the remains of a Paleozoic Amphibian in its jaws! How did it get there?!  How do you know? You don\\'t have a watch.  Monica, whatever you do, do not drop that ball!  2 hours, 27 minutes.  Hey Rach!  Check it out! Almost 3 hours without droppin\\' it!  Yeah.  Doesn\\'t sound as crazy as paying a thousand dollars for a cat.  It\\'s really a uh-uh three person game, y\\'know?  Baking it didn\\'t help, huh?  I\\'m starving!  I\\'m still hungry!  I am!  Oh, thank God!  I know. My arm is killing me.  Hi!  I know, it\\'s crazy! We were just pushing Ben on the swings…  All right, I gotta take off. I\\'m picking up Ben then we\\'re off to the big audition.  Yeah.  Yeah the dad and Ben eat soup and pretend to enjoy it.  You\\'re not his godfather.  Really? That\\'s great!  Joey, you look nothing like Ben.  Not so good.  Oh God, this is so nerve wracking! How-how do you do this?  Yeah!  Yeah, it is.  No, we-we\\'re gonna be like best friends, that\\'s why it\\'s gonna be weird.  Seriously that\\'s a lot of cups.  Hey!  What\\'s up?  Wow, uh, Joey that\\'s-that\\'s great. Thanks man.  Well, you just…  What?!  Why should Ben step aside? It was his audition in the first place! You-you just tagged along! You\\'re like the uh, tag-a-long dad.  What?!  And why wouldn\\'t he get it?  Are you saying your kid eats soup better than my kid?  Oh yeah? I guess we\\'ll just see!  You\\'re kid\\'s name is Raymond!  Hey!  Listen man, uh, I\\'m sorry the audition didn\\'t go so well.  No really, I-I am! I feel bad!  Yeah y\\'know what? Maybe-maybe you didn\\'t mess up your audition because you suck, maybe you messed up because you care more about uh, your godson.  I think, sub-consciously…  No!  There you go. Thank you!  No.  What did you want to show us? Because all I can see is this bitchin\\' van!  I don’t know, I could maybe go out for a couple of beers, but there’s this thing about bumblebees on The Discovery Channel that I was planning to watch.  Nooo!! Gandolf?! Gandolf is coming to town?  Dude, we are sooo gonna party!  Mike \"Gandolf\" Ganderson, only like the funest guy in the world.  I’m gonna call after you!  Joey, you are gonna love this guy. Gandolf is like the party wizard!  Somewhere maybe along the equator?  What happened?  Ohh, man! Chicago, is sooo lucky!  It’s Gandolf, and he’s not coming.  No! I balanced my checkbook.  I can’t believe he didn’t come!  Yeah! We’d meet, we’d meet total strangers, and hang out with them!  There’s other stuff too.  Yeah!  Yeah!!  It’s not like we don’t know how to party!!  Yeah.  Okay.  I’m kinda beat.  Yeah, me too.  I’m just glad I brought that extra pair of socks, y’know? I used them as mittens, I didn’t want to touch a thing in that last place.  How sad are we?  And so what if I like to go home, throw on some Kenny G, and take a bath!  Hey!  Why’d you say no?  Just then or-or all the time, ‘cause we-we have jobs y’know.  Shhh! We’re not talking.  Uh, double latte, extra foam.  Are you serious?!  Wow! We are pretty good at this!  Hey! We totally forgot about lunch!  It tastes like feet!  Are you kidding?  Yeah, so far nothing stupid.  Uh no, no just-just that he is a great guy.  Yeah, you too.  Your make-up!  Okay. Now-now-now should I climb down your front so we’re face to face or-or should I climb down your back so we’re-we’re butt to face.  I would say that.  Okay, here I go.  I prefer not to answer that right now, I’m still carrying a little holiday weight.  It really was.  Hi Jill.  Amazing! Amazing!  Wow! This picture of you sure is steamy.  Did you just wink at me?  How come? Everybody else does.  Oh, umm, I\\'m just getting rid of a couple of things.  Yes, yes it is! No, but it\\'s good it\\'s—Emily thinks we should get all new stuff. Stuff that\\'s just ours, together. Y\\'know brand new.  Touched. Used. Sat on. Sleep on.  Look, if I can just do what Emily wants and get her to New York, I\\'m sure everything will be fine.  After what I did? Can you blame her?  Nothing. Oh, actually, great news! I just got off the phone with Emily and it looks like I\\'m moving to a new apartment. Woo-hoo!  Well, her thought is, and I agree, fresh new furniture, why not a fresh new apartment? Her cousin has this great place to sublet, it\\'s got a view of the river on one side and Columbia on the other.  Yes! Yes! I mean it\\'s-it\\'s kinda far from work, but uh, y\\'know, I\\'ll get so much done on the commute. I-I\\'ve been given the gift of time!  No-no, this is my collection of fossil samples.  I loved this place! To tell you the truth, I wish I didn\\'t have to move.  Well, I mean if uh, if Emily gave me a choice…  Why?  What\\'s going on?  Yep.  Y\\'know what? I\\'m really not in the mood.  Look, this is hard enough! I really need you guys right now.  Okay. Thanks you guys. Pheebs are you wearing fur?  You do, huh?  What are you talking about?  Wait! Wait! Wait! Y\\'know what? Just stay. Please? It uh… It would really mean a lot to me if you stayed.  Hey! Hey, look! Ugly Naked Guy\\'s back!  Yeah, yeah, she\\'s here.  Emily that\\'s ridiculous. Look, I\\'m-I\\'m moving for you, I\\'m cutting friends out of my life for you. Please, just get on the plane and come to New York. Okay, you\\'ll see you\\'re the only person I want to be with.  Well, you can\\'t know where I am all the time. Look, this marriage is never gonna work if you don\\'t trust me.  So, can you trust me?  Well, I guess that\\'s it.  My marriage is over.  Yeah. You can help me get my furniture back from Gunther.  Hey! Oh, I’m so glad you guys are here. I’ve been dying to tell someone what happened in the Paleontology department today.  Professor Neuman, the head of the department, so….  What?! That-that’s all the way cross town, I’m supposed to teach a graduate seminar there in ten minutes.  Move it! Move it! Move it!! Hey!!! I’m the teacher!!  No, I ran. It was really far, and when did people stop understanding the phrase, \"Get the hell out of my way!\"  Ugh, between the traffic that time of day and all the one-way streets it’ll take me twice as long. Besides, I teach the class three times a week, who am I? Rockefeller?  Well I have to. Okay? If I don’t, they’ll take the class away from me. And…I already put it in my family newsletter.  You’ve seen it, the Geller Yeller.  Phoebe!!  Umm…  But the good news is, no one in a two-block radius will ever know.  Yeah, they all know.  Are ya?  What are you doing up?  Okay look, I had a lot of water before I went to bed. Can we do this after…  It’s funny you should mention diapers.  Okay look, there’s nothing to worry about. We have plenty of time. There’s a great baby furniture store on west 10th. Tomorrow, we will go there and we will get you everything that you need. Okay?  Oh.  Oh, okay.  I chose those, I’m a paleontologist.  Yeah! I-I teach it in my class.  That’s my gym.  I am like Indiana Jones.  Ah, must’ve been fairly obvious since it was the only thing left in your store.  Hey.  How are you?  Uhh, it was fun. We, we just had coffee.  What’s uh, what’s going on? Do you not, do you not like Katie?  I liked her.  Did you get like a fresh batch of pregnancy hormones today?!  Why? What was wrong with her?  Okay, so what’s the matter?  Okay.  I won’t date. I’ll uh, I’ll be here, with you, all the time.  True, but you’re allowed to be unreasonable. You’re having our baby.  Do you feel better?  Uh Rach?  Just one thing umm…  We live together. You’re having our baby. I’m not gonna see anybody else. Are you-are you sure you don’t want something more?  …that you actually…  Rach?  The bathroom?  Try sixty-five million years ago, and then try sssshhhhhh.... My tenure review board met today and I hear it\\'s looking really good.  Yeah. Do you have any idea what this means in academic circles, uh? I am gonna get laid.  No, no. I-I\\'m good.  I\\'m up for tenure.  You too! What are the odds?  I guess it\\'s here because I GOT TENURE!  This is the single greatest day of my professional career. Gunther, six glasses!  I got tenure. I didn\\'t win the lottery... Hey Rach, so uh... how did your thing go?  Oh, you know what? You\\'re gonna get it. I-I-I-I can feel it.  And-and to years of hard work finally paying off.  But also knowing it means a lot.  ...that center around work.  You know what the best part about this is? I can never be fired.  Rach, I\\'m so sorry.  Great. I feel like an idiot.  See? I told you something good would come along. And he seemed really nice. I\\'ve met him before?  I hate that guy.  No, no, NO, you cannot go to dinner with him.  Oh yeah, I\\'m sure he\\'s gonna give you a job. Maybe make you his SEXretary.  I\\'m serious. I just don\\'t trust that guy, okay?  Hey, is Rachel here?  She\\'s still at dinner?  That guy Mark. From Bloomingdale\\'s... She thinks he\\'s just being nice to her. But I know he really wants to sleep with her.  We ran into him on the street today and he said he might have a job for her. But I know he just wants to get into her pants.  Hey, so uhm... How was dinner?  Should we send something?  Congratulations!  Nope. I mean, I know Susan does every year, but I think I wanna take this year to teach him all about Hanukkah.  Hmm.  Wooooooo, hehehe. Hey, ahh, you don\\'t feel like you\\'re gonna throw up, do ya?  Yep, and you know what other holiday is coming up?  Right, um, but, on Hanukkah, Hanukkah is a celebration of a miracle. See, years and years ago there were these people called the Maccabees.  Well, how about this year, instead of Santa, we have fun celebrating Hanukkah?  No! Oh, no-no-no. Hey, you weren\\'t bad, you\\'ve been very good, Ben.  Hey!  No, these are my pants.  Well, uh, do you have a Santa-outfit left?  Okay look, do-do, you have anything Christmassy? I promised my son, and I really don\\'t want to disappoint him, um, come on, I…uh, you gotta have something.  You\\'re welcome, Ben. Merry Christmas, ooh, and Happy Hanukkah!  Yeah!  Years and years ago there were these people called the Maccabees...  What are you doing here, Santa?  I\\'m the Holiday Armadillo, your part-Jewish friend. You sent me here to give Ben some presents. Remember?  Thank you, but, but you gotta leave.  Because, I\\'m finally getting him excited about Hanukkah, and, and you\\'re-you’re wrecking it.  I\\'m sorry, Chandler but this, this is really important to me.  Okay Ben, Santa has to go. Say good-bye!  Fine, I-I give up. Santa, Santa can stay.  All right, it\\'s time for the story of Hanukkah. Years and years ago, there were these people called the Maccabees.  …and the miracle was that that little bit of oil that should’ve just lasted just one day, burned for…  That’s right, and that’s why we celebrate Hanukkah today. The end.  Yeah?  Come on, come on, we’re-we’re-we’re lighting the candles!  Why?  Oh God. Y\\'know, botanists are such geeks.  Honey, just relax, it\\'s gonna be fine. Hey, umm,. why don\\'t I come down there and I\\'ll take you out to lunch?  Mark is that ah, the same Mark that helped you get the job?  What? Oh yeah, yeah I think so. Why am I invited to this again?  Ah Joey, I don\\'t think you get to pick the cities.  Mr. Dickens gets to pick \\'em.  This is Ross?  Of Ross and Rachel.  Oh hey, hey Mark.  Okay.  Hi! What\\'s ah, what\\'s Mark doing answering your phone?  Ohhhhh yeah, that\\'s, that\\'s funny. Why ah, why isn\\'t he goofing around in his own office?  Why does Joanna need two assistants, how, how lazy is she?  What?  It\\'s from Ross, it\\'s a love bug.  I\\'m hurt! I\\'m actually hurt, that you would think that I would send you any of those things out of any thing other than love. Hurt! Hurt!  I mean my God...  ...can\\'t, can\\'t a guy send a barbershop quartet to his girlfriend\\'s office anymorrrrre!!  I would never do that!  Yeah well if, if, if Mark said that, than Mark\\'s an idiot.  Why?! How?! How is he a genius?  What am I going to do?  I don\\'t know you guys.  All right that\\'s, that\\'s it!! Get off her!  A big idiot. Just you have to realize is, this whole Mark thing is kinda hard for me.  Well, I was with Carol for like eight years and I lost her. And now if it\\'s possible I think I love you even more. So, it\\'s hard for me to believe that I\\'m not gonna, well that someone else is not going to take you away.  I gotta get going. Bye Chandler.  Oh, I\\'ve got to go pick up Ben, we\\'ve got a play date this afternoon.  Oh, just this woman that I met last night at the party.  Yeah.  Ah, yeah, yeah. Umm, we started talking after she y\\'know, did her thing. And it turns out she\\'s got a boy about Ben\\'s age, so we\\'re taking them to a gym-boree class. Why, is that okay?  Ahh, no.  Are you jealous?  You are totally jealous.  Honey, I love you too.  What?  Huh.  Come on, I think this is a good thing. I don’t think Mom would’ve hired you if she didn’t think you were good at what you do.  …I’m telling you it’s totally unconstituional.  The volcano?  With such a sad history.  What the hell are doing?!!  Hey, you know what I just realized? If you guys ever have kids…  You can\\'t just call Godfather. Don\\'t you think her brother should be Godfather?  Aww.  Huh.  Ohh.  Thanks. Thanks. And thanks again.  Hi!  Oh hi! Ross Geller. And this is my friend Phoebe.  Howard?  Oh that\\'s nice.  Oh. Uhh…  No-no, it\\'s not that, it\\'s just… I-I just moved in.  Yes, but I\\'ve lived here for 25 minutes.  No wait, look. Look! I\\'m sorry, it\\'s just I\\'ve never even met Howard. I-I mean I don\\'t know Howard.  Yes but too me he\\'s just, man.  …so then President Steve told everyone that I was a cheapskate, and now the whole building hates me! A little kid spit on my knee! Y\\'know what I\\'m gonna do? I\\'m gonna throw a party. That\\'s right. For everyone in the building, and I\\'m gonna sit them down and explain to them, I am not a bad guy. I am not a cheap guy! I\\'m just a guy who-who stands up for what he believes in. A man with principles.  It doesn\\'t matter! It\\'s my principles! We\\'re talking about my principles!  Oh, no!  Well, unless you make some kind of big gesture.  What are you doing?  You chipped in?!  Phoebe! I can\\'t believe you gave them money! I thought you agreed it was totally unreasonable that they asked me for that money!  Yeah, but you\\'re making me look bad!  Look, this is a disaster! Can\\'t I please just go?  So uh, what did you tell them about me?  What?!  Oh wow, yeah! See, I did not get that.  Oh-no. No. No.  Hey!  Yeah, but still, cheap shot!  No, I will not!  You\\'re right, I\\'m sorry. Will you marry me?  Hey you guys!  Hey, what are you doing?  Yeah!  There\\'s no way around it Pheebs, you just gonna have to accept the fact that this is gonna cost you a lot of money.  Yeah, and I\\'m responsible for just like half of that.  I\\'ve got to say you guys, that\\'s an incredible gesture!  Oh, good!  Oh, that\\'s OK. I\\'m sure there are tons of other beautiful paleontologists out there.  There was one! She\\'s it! All the rest look like they should live under a bridge!  Well, I was thinking of taking Emma to the playground!  Like I said I was thinking of taking Emma to the museum of knives and fire!  Be-caaauuuse...  Seriously?  Look, I\\'m sorry to hear about your tragedy, ok? But the swings are perfectly safe, and besides Emma loves them. You know what, you should come with us and you\\'ll see!  Good, you don’t want to be one of those mothers who pass on their irrational fears on their children, do you?  Oh, yeah, that’s the same, I am sure there are thirty different species of poisonous swings!  Ok.  Rach, she’s got like three hairs!  I promise you she’s safe! No watch how much she loves this.  See, I told you!  Oh, absolutely!  No! No, no, no, no, okay, it wasn\\'t the swing\\'s fault. It was my fault and kind  No wait, okay, okay, I have an idea. I want you to get on the swing, okay? And  Look, I just think you\\'re an adult, okay? And you should get over your silly  Good.  I know. (Rachel bends down to Emma and Ross looks over his shoulder again,  See?  There you go! Good for you! And you know what, I\\'m actually getting used to this little guy. I don\\'t really even feel him in here anymore.   Excuse me?  You\\'re right, you\\'re right, it is.   So you gonna invite us all to the big opening?  It’s your turn.  Wait a minute, are you doing that thing where you pretend it didn’t go well but it really did go well?  Totally!  Great!  Wow!  Look, don’t worry. Okay? You’re gonna be fine.  Yeah, none of us have to deal with pressure at our jobs.   Oh my God!  You ate my sandwich?  What?  What?  Yes, yes it is. In prison!  It took two people to break up this relationship!!  I didn’t know what I was taking full responsibility for! Okay?! I didn’t finish the whole letter!  I fell asleep!  There was just an explosion, okay? My hearing would be impaired.  Thank you! And I have to say that first scene when you meet Mac…  Oh my God. I mean…  Totally.  Get out.  Well uh, it\\'s cause he had a thing with, wi-, with the thing.  Wha-, you have a phone in here?  Get the what?  Calm down, I\\'m blow drying.  I\\'m telling you, there\\'s no way he\\'s moving back.  Look, I know you don\\'t want to hear this right now but, we\\'ve seen him in his new place, alright. And he\\'s happy, he\\'s, he\\'s decorated.  No. You\\'re just gonna have to accept the fact that you\\'re just friends now, OK, you\\'re not... rommmates anymore.  Did you see me write one down?  Well, she\\'ll call back, don\\'t be such a baby.  Look, you wanna get off my back?  OK.  Uh, Eddie something. He just met him.  I know.  Tough noogies, we\\'re watching Predators of the Serengetti.  Wha-, oh, quit it.  Well, Monica keeps changin\\' the channel.  Well, I guess we could tape Entertainment Tonight.  Ow, ow, OK. Alright, alright, Mon, Mon, you\\'ve gone ultrasonic again, alright.  Why, why, why can\\'t you stand me being here? I don\\'t, I, we\\'re just, ya know, we\\'re just havin\\' fun.  Yeah, c\\'mon I mean I though, you know, I thought we\\'re just foolin\\' around. Like when, uh, when we were kids.  You hated me when we were kids?  Why did you hate me?  And that wasn\\'t fun for you?  I can\\'t believe you hated me.  Really?  I can do that.  So you wanna watch uh, Entertainment Tonight?  What?  What woman?  I think it’s coming from your bag.  So apparently I’m available for lunch.  You’re moving?  So does-does Joey know you’re moving?  That’s not really porn.  Hey, y’know what and if you’re looking for a place? I just heard in the elevator this morning that a woman in my building died.  Yeah.  Yeah. No. No you’re right.  Yeah.  Hi. I’m Ross Geller. I live in the building.  I-I heard about Mrs. Verhoeven passing away and I’m so sorry for your loss.  What?  Oh, thank God!  Y’know I would it’s just painful.  Yeah, we’re done.  Really?!  Sweet!  Okay I-I just have to stop by my place first.  No-no, I-I have to see if this apartment became available.  It’s not for me, it’s for Rachel.  Yeah, but when the baby comes she’s gonna want to move.  Yeah, you didn’t expect her to live there with a baby did you?  Damnit!  Hi. How is she?  Oh I don’t know that it would.  Hey...  Well, it had some good ideas, take off your shirt.  Damnit!  Still sharp as a tack!  Hi Rachel! Here\\'s your sister Amy! She thinks I need pec implants!  Ehm... Her name is Emma.  What do I know? I just sell Middle Eastern food from a cart!  What... what you working on?  Why don\\'t you use your Thesaurus?  Seriously?  Well, do you wanna marry him?  Absolutely! You\\'ll love the feeling! There\\'s nothing like it!  No, I can\\'t. I have back-to-back classes. Did Molly say what she had? Because my throat\\'s been hurting?  I don\\'t think that\\'s what this is.  Um, I do not want her baby-sitting our child.  Well, for one thing, she keeps calling her Ella!  Fine, we\\'ll call the next one Ella.  I... I don\\'t know..  Hey guys.  Why not?  That\\'s not a thing!  Hey!  Wow! You look nice. What\\'s the occasion?  Wow! How\\'d you get in there?  What the hell was that?!  The flirting! Aren\\'t you supposed to be going out with, I don\\'t know hmm, let\\'s say my sister?!  Yeah, right.  And on your anniversary, for shame!  Chandler was hitting on the hot delivery girl!  Well I\\'m sorry but you were! Okay? And besides if anyone should be hitting on her it\\'s the guy who\\'s single, the guy that who-who-who can do something about it.  Well…  Well, I-I was watching her the other day at the pizza place.  And she\\'s just so sexy and funny and has the cutest little…  This is perfect! She\\'ll have to come back here with your pizza, and when she does, I\\'ll turn on the Charm-O-Ross. Oh I\\'m so glad you don\\'t eat meat.  Hi!  Oh. Uh, by the way, if it makes you feel any better. I happen to like 8-year-old boys.  You understand I don\\'t actually like 8-year-old boys.  You couldn\\'t let me have her, could ya?!  This is a girl that I really like and had too swoop in there!  Chandler was totally flirting with the hot delivery girl!  Really?!  And thank you, for that.  Do you like it?  Okay, I\\'m working on my flirting.  Gas? Wow! Intense.  They put that in.  The gas is odorless, but they add the smell so you know when there\\'s a leak.  A lot of other gas smells…  Meth-methane smells…  Oh but I-I-I haven\\'t paid you yet!  Yeah?  What do you mean?  And she just gave you this?  Rach, thanks but uh, I don\\'t need you doing me any favors.  Well that I can believe.  Hm-mmm.  I don\\'t know, you don\\'t wanna mess with corn nuts. They\\'re craaazy.  I can\\'t believe it! He\\'s looking right at us!  Okay, okay, what\\'s going on?  Yeah, well, does he look upset? Does he look like he was just told to shove anything?  What? What? What?!  That\\'s nice... now, was that before or after you told him to stop calling, stop sending you flowers and to generally leave you alone, hmm?  That\\'s, that\\'s nice twice!  What was with the dishes?  ...desperate, needy, pathetic?  You-you had what?  What, uh... what were you thinking?  No! No no, it is nothing like me and Carol!  It\\'s, it\\'s, it\\'s, uh, a totally diferent situation! It\\'s, it\\'s apples and oranges, it\\'s, it\\'s orthodontists and lesbi- I gotta go.  Four letters: \"Circle or hoop\".  Thanks.  \"Heating device.\"  Five letters.  I just wanna clarify this: are you outing Mr. Peanut?  Second date!  No why?  Oh well, I guess I’ll catch up with her later.  Oh no.  I think I might know what this is about.  Yeah. Uh, uh we promised we weren’t gonna tell anybody this but uh, about a month ago Rachel and I slept together.  Wow! I thought you would be a little more shocked.  Well, we-we said we’d just do it that one time but, but now I think she may wanna start things up again.  Why? What-what else could it be?  I’m telling you. I’m telling you. That’s what it is. No wonder she was looking at me all funny during the wedding. She didn’t say anything to you?  Hi.  Yeah, and to save you from any embarrassment umm, I think maybe I should talk first.  I mean look, that-that one night we had was fun and…and certainly passionate, but don’t you think it’s better if we just stayed friends?  Okay. Okay. Y’know what? If you want to, we can do it one more time. I mean I’d-I’d be okay with that. In fact, I have some time right now.  I’m good. I’m good.  Yeah, I need uh… I’m just—I don’t know—I don’t understand, umm, how this happened? We-we used a condom.  What? What? What?!! Well they should put that on the box!!!  Oh well I may as well have!  Freaked out? Hey no, I’m not freaked out! I’m indignant! As a consumer!  Hi.  Sure.  Oh my God! What happened to the door?!  Look, is Rachel here? I really need to talk to her.  With my child.  You already know don’t you?  Okay. Okay. I mean I’ll be okay. It’s just I don’t think I handled it very well.  Nothing. But the complaint department at the condom company got an earful. And then when I turned around she was gone.  But hey, in my defense I-I just found out condoms are like only 97% effective.  I gotta go find her.  Evidently they do.  Hi!  Uh we-we need to talk.  Please, please I want to apologize for the way I acted earlier today.  Right! Right! I just—I want you to know that I’m going to be there through this whole thing, okay? Okay? The doctor’s appointments, the uh, the Lamaze classes, uh baby-proofing the apartment—Although we could probably worry about that ‘til after we get married.  Well yeah, I think we should get married.  No, because that’s the right thing to do.  No but…but still you can’t possibly do this alone.  Come on Rach, you can’t even eat alone in a restaurant.  I’m just saying if you can’t eat by yourself, how do you expect to have a baby by yourself?  When have you ever?  Well certain other people take two hours to eat a bowl of soup!  I grew up with Monica! If you didn’t eat fast you didn’t eat!!  But not the husband, because evidently she can do this alone.  Oh my God.  Thank you.  Pretty amazing huh?  What? What?!  You-you just said that you did!  Do you really?  Sweetie that’s it.  You’re welcome.  Yeah, that’s our baby.  Oh hey, show them the picture of your uterus.  Oh. (He takes the picture and hugs her.  I had to talk loud because the movie was loud!  No wait! Look, wait! Okay, you can hang up, but I\\'m gonna keep calling! I\\'m gonna, I\\'m gonna call everyone in England if that\\'s what it takes to get you to talk to me!  Look you\\'re my wife. We\\'re-we\\'re married. Y\\'know? I-I love you. I-I really miss you.  Well, Emily\\'s willing to work on the relationship.  In London!  She wants me to move to London.  I bet if I talk to Carol and Susan I can convince them to move to London with Ben.  It could happen.  All right Emily, as much as I love you, I\\'m sorry, I can\\'t move to London without Ben.  Yeah, would you please consider moving here? I mean you were gonna move here anyway, why can\\'t you just do that?  Oh-oh-okay, but-but I know, that even though I\\'ve been a-a complete idiot up \\'til now, I mean, I mean you-you-you have to come here. You have to come here so we can work this out.  All right, did you just say all right?  Oh, Emily that is, that is so great. It\\'s gonna be so great! We\\'re gonna be like-like-like two idiots in love!  Yes, tell me.  I know. I am, I am so sorry.  Again, very sorry.  Emily, there is nothing between Rachel and me. Okay? I love you.  Oh that is so great! That\\'s…  So I asked Emily if she would come to New York, and she said yes.  No-no-no! Only if I promise never to see Rachel again.  For what?  Yeah, I uh, totally forgot about that. You mind if I take a rain check? I\\'m waiting for a call from Emily.  It\\'s not that easy, there\\'s still a lot of relationship stuff.  Just stuff. Y\\'know kinda what Emily wants.  No. No. You-you can\\'t help. I mean, I kinda have to do this without your help.  Thanks.  Halftime.  What?  Um, Monica and I aren’t supposed to play football.  It was soo not an accident. She saw I was about to tag her, so she threw her big fat grandma arm elbow right into my face. And just keep running.  Whoa, whoa, whoa, ho, ho, ho, you did not win the game, the touchdown didn’t count, because of the spectacularly illegal, oh and by the way savage nose breaking.  Oh yeah! Then how come you didn’t get the Geller Cup?  Anyway. That’s when our Mom said we were not to play football ever again.  Can I see you for a second?  All right, we’re gonna play.  Sweetie, don’t worry you’ll get picked. Chandler.  Sweetie, now I pick you.  Okay. All right. So let’s see, let’s play from the trash can, to the lightpost. Right. Two hand touch, we’ll kick off.  Oww!! Son of a...!! Ow! Come on!  Come on, let’s go!  Yeah, losers talk!  Yeah!  You, you go long.  Until we start to look very small.  Break!!  One-Mississippi, two-Mississippi, switch! Switch! Switch!!  Uh, hello, it’s third down.  Wow!  It just amazes me that your still pulling stuff like this.  Well, I said it loud.  Chandler, I want you to run a post pattern to the left, okay. And sweetie..  Well ah, you wanna just stay out there?  Yeah.  Okay. Hut! Hike!  Uh, hello, the buzzer buzzed. It doesn’t count.  Before the snap!  Oh Pheebs, that’s great. It doesn’t count.  Cheater, cheater, compulsive eater.  Oh-ho, okay.  Ow! Ow! Okay, okay, fine, fine! All right, you wanna win by cheating, go ahead, all right. Phoebe the touchdown does count, you win.  Okay, first of all, I don’t play with cheaters, and second of all, you know I had swollen glands!!  Oh really! Why is that?  The Geller Cup.  Okay, where in the hell did you get that?!  That cup is mine!  Chandler! Chandler!  Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! What’s with the tackling?  Okay, you wanna play rough, we can play rough.  Hey, where’d you get that?  It’s no surprise that your winning, ‘cause you got to pick first, so you got the better team.  What?! The guys against the girls? See, that’s ridiculous Monica, because I’m only down by three touchdowns.  Fine, fine, Rachel your with Monica, Joey you’re with me.  Right. Okay, let’s play. Let’s go.  Enough with geography for the insane, okay? Let’s play some ball, guys.  Okay, y\\'know what, let’s just cut to the chase here. Okay? Heidi, which of my boys do you like?  Yeah, y\\'know for dating, general merriment, taking back to your windmill...  Save the breakthroughs for therapy, okay. The clock is ticking. We have no time, and we are losing, we are losing to girls.  Hey! It’s 42-21!  Let go! Let go!  No! You let go!  How come it’s always us left in the field holding the ball?  Hey! It’s starting to snow.  Gimme the this!  That’s too bad.  Yeah? What about ah, that bike messenger you hit?  Yeah, I think she looks good.  Go, go, go!  Yeah, either that, or he has a really big cat.  Get away!  Stay away!  Ow! Ow! Oh, no-no-no!  Hey!  Whoa, hey! What are doing? Trying to get me drunk?  Okay.  Oh.  Good morning.  Uh, Pheebs, some people call that breaking and entering.  Nooo, but it, but it’s great.  Hi.  I was having a little chat with ah, Bonnie, and ah, guess what, she-she happened to bring up y\\'know, who was behind the um, whole head shaving idea, and now, who was it? Oh, that’s right, that’s right, it was you!  She said you gave her the razor!  Ahh, no, I’m good.  Okay, have fun! Wooo!!  You can see the moonlight bouncing off her head! What the hell were you thinking?!!  You don’t know?! Rach, you balded my girlfriend!  Y\\'know, hey! You’re the one who ended it, remember?  You still love me?  You still love me.  Noo, nnnnn. What does this mean? What do you, I mean do you wanna, get back together?  What?!  What?  That’s not true! Her, she doesn’t even know what she wants! Rachel’s still mad about the whole thing.  I know, but ahhhhhh!! I really wanna go up there and finish that kiss!  Good night.  Okey-dokey!  Yeah.  Hey, you’re not going to believe this. I made up a joke and sent it in to Playboy. They printed it!  Yeah, they print jokes, interviews, hard-hitting journalism. It’s not just about the pictures.  What?  Uh, oh-oh, no you didn’t. I did.  Hey, tell Dan, ‘Thanks.’  What?  Look, Chandler, it’s my joke. But, hey, if it makes you feel any better they don’t print the name, so it doesn’t really matter who gets credit, right?  No, it’s my joke, it’s mine. You can call them, they’ll tell you.  It’s my joke.  You know, Barracuda was the first song I learned to play on the keyboard.  What, you didn’t get it? The doctor is a monkey.  Your joke? Well, I think ‘the Hef’ would disagree, which is why he sent me a check for one hundred ah-dollars.  Well, I was going to stick it in the ATM, but now I think I’ll show the sexy teller that I am a published writer.  Oh, what are you going to do, follow me down there?  Uh, yeah, I’ll take a coffee. Thanks, man.  Yeah, why would it be weird? Hey, Joey, can I get some coffee?  Seriously, I-I asked you before and you still haven’t gotten it.  Joey, seriously, can I get my coffee?  It’s my joke.  Y’know, I don’t think we’re going to settle this.  Yeah!  Hey Mon.  Yeah.  Yeah, but I’m your brother. We’re family. That’s the most important thing in the world.  We’ll each tell you how we came up with the joke and then you decide which one of us is telling the truth—me.  See, I would never snap at you like that.  Are you kidding? Okay, look. I-I studied evolution. Remember, evolution? Monkey into man? Plus, I’m a doctor, and I had a monkey. I’m Doctor Monkey!  It’s your joke.  No way.  Yeah, you too. Man, so-so what are you up to?  Really? Yeah that-that sounds interesting.  Oh! Man I don’t think I’ve seen you since uh, Lance Davis’ graduation party.  Yeah. It would’ve been good if we had gotten in, but still real fun.  Yeah.  So how long are you in town?  Aw—oh, that’s right. Are-are you gonna be okay?  Will, high school was-was a long time ago.  No need to point, she knows who Ross is.  No. No.  Uh actually, there-there was also that exchange student from Thailand but I-I don’t think he-he knew what it was.  That was in high school! It’s not like it was binding forever.  Look Rach I-I’m sorry, okay? I…I was a stupid kid, okay? The only reason I joined…  …co-founded. Co-founded the club was because I was insanely in love with you. Obviously I didn’t handle it very well. But if you think about it the I Hate Rachel Club was really the I Love Rachel Club.  No-no! No-no. No-no.  It was no big deal. We-we…said that the rumor was…that umm…you had both…male and female reproductive parts.  Actually, Billy Tratt is gay now. So-so that one’s not really our fault.  Rach, I think you’re reading a little too much into it.  Look, what do you want me to do? Do you want me to call everyone in the entire school and tell them it wasn’t true?!  Well look-look I’m not calling anybody! Okay? It was like a million years ago!  What?  No.  Hey! She didn’t look 50!  She didn’t photograph well!  I was working late in the library one afternoon. It was just the two of us. She needed some help with her word jumble. And one thing led to another. If you must know, Anita was very gentle and tender. May she rest in peace…  As a romancer of the elderly.  The eyes…did still sparkle.  Yeah. I mean we are having a baby together.  Yeah.  Nope.  What?  Well, I’ll-I’ll be there. I mean I have to wear a costume to all my classes that day anyway so…  Yeah. Yeah, I think I will.  Yeah.  No, I-I’m not doody.  Hey!  You made it!  Well, I’m a spud…  Yes!  That’s funny. Yeah. Y’know you’re the funniest man here in a pink bunny costume his wife made him wear.  Uh, in her defense, she’s right. I am stronger. I would destroy you.  Oh I’ll prove it! I’ll prove it like a theorem!!  Oh yeah? You’re going further down! Downtown!  Pride.  Hey, at least you have a wife! I-I keep getting divorces and knockin’ people up! And I’m dressed as doody.  Come on, who are we kidding? I’m doody. Please? She’s watchin’.  Yeah?  What am I looking at?  Me too!  Ross has the blender! Ugh, everything\\'s just falling apart!  Oh hey, Gary, want me to grab the berry for ya?  It\\'s the—Chandler!!  So where are we going next?  Yeah, no one talks like that!  Hey, I\\'m more cop than you two!  Hello! I\\'m in the front seat, okay? I\\'m Gary\\'s partner!  What is it?  What? What? What? What is it?  Uh-huh. Thank Joey!  Pheebs, we had the most incredible night! Okay, so, we\\'re in the car…  Okay, okay, so we\\'re in the car. Right? And bang! A shot was fired. And Joey with no regard for his own safety throws himself on me!  Yeah, but-but he didn\\'t know that!  And it could\\'ve just as easily have been a bullet.  Wow! I could\\'ve died tonight.  I do have a newfound respect for life.  Rach, what uh, what are you doing here?  The most amazing thing happened tonight. I thought my number was up. I had an actual near death experience!  Okay, okay, we were on the ride along with Gary, right?  And somebody took a shot at me!  You talked to her?  Well, okay, what-what did she say?  Wow!  Huh? Yeah! Yes, of course!  Right. I guess, I guess I should call Emily.  Okay, look, yesterday I would\\'ve even considered calling her back, but my ex-wife calls on the same day I have a near death experience. I mean, that-that has got to mean something!  You weren\\'t there! Okay, maybe this is something that I-I\\'m supposed to seize! Y\\'know?  Huh.  That does make sense. Because I do wanna seize some opportunity, but I-I really don\\'t wanna see or talk to her.  Yeah. Maybe today is just, close call day.  Oh wait-wait-wait! The message is blinking. Maybe you didn\\'t erase it.  Yeah, I want my money back.  Hey Pheebs, has Gary ever been shot at for real?  I wonder how I would react under fire, y\\'know? And not backfire but-but heavy fire, like I was in a war or something.  I know where Joey would be. He would be down in the foxhole protecting all of us.  A lot of people are thankful for those.  Hey Amy.  That was me.  Sure, we don\\'t live there but...  I know, I mean a PhD is just as good as an MD.  Don\\'t say that.  Sure, you want to go upstairs?  You know, I think thats a great idea. It\\'ll be like the pilgrims bringing the Indians syphilis.  Ok, fine, but I don\\'t want them bonding to much. I don\\'t want her telling Emma she needs a nose job.  Emma.  Well we haven\\'t offically asked them yet, but we would want Monica and Chandler.  well.. its just. its just in that case, then um. Emma would go to my parents.  Yeah and we\\'d want to make sure Emma has someone like Monica who is more uh. uh discliplinarin.. someone who can be firm and strict.  No, you both are equally capable. Its just.. you\\'re strongest when.. when you\\'re together.  Sure, Monica would have to give her up.  Hey dude, you okay? Sorry about before.  Emma.  Dude. Well done. You know what? If I die, and Rachel dies and Monica dies then you can totally take care of Emma.  So, so now do I get Joey?  She barely knows me. We just live in the same building.  She lent me an egg once.  Aw, right.  An egg?  I think it\\'s insane.  Hi. She said yes.  I\\'m just sayin\\' if dogs do experience jet lag, then, because of the whole um, seven dog years to one human year thing, then, when a dog flies from New York to Los Angeles, he doesn\\'t just lose three hours, he loses like a week and a half.  The blond woman is my ex-wife, and the woman touching her is her... close, personal friend.  If you wanna put a label on it.  Nope, nope, that\\'s it.  So, um, what do you do for a living?  Now that is funny. Hey, do you think...would it be too weird if I invited Carol over to join us? \\'Cause she\\'s, she\\'s alone now, and pregnant, and, and sad.  Are you sure? Great. Carol? Wanna come over and join us?  Well maybe it\\'s cold in there. Or maybe I screwed up the first date I had in 9 years.  No, it\\'s just...you know the whole \"getting on with your life\" thing. Well, do I have to? I mean, I\\'m sitting here with this cute woman, and, and, and she\\'s perfectly nice, and, but that there\\'s, that\\'s it. And um, and then I\\'m here talkin\\' to you, and, and it\\'s easy, and it\\'s fun, and, and I don\\'t, I don\\'t have to...You know, here\\'s a wacky thought. Um, what\\'s say you and I give it another shot? No no no, I know what you\\'re gonna say, you\\'re a lesbian. But what do you say we just put that aside for now you know? Let\\'s just stick a pin in it, ok? Because, we\\'re great together, you know. You can\\'t deny it. Besides, you\\'re carrying my baby. I mean, how perfect is that? But see, you know, you keep sayin\\' that, but there\\'s somethin\\' right here. I love you.  No but, no but.  That\\'s easy for you to say, you found one already.  Ok. Here\\'s his diaper bag, and his uh, Mr. Winky, and uh...oh, him. Hi!  Oh, great. Great. There was a projectile, uh, throwing up incident, but he started it.  Ok.  Oh, you and me?  Ok.  As in, \"I now pronounce you wife and wife\" married?  Why wouldn\\'t I want to come? I had fun at the first wedding.  No no no, I mean, hey, why shouldn\\'t I be happy for you? What would it say about me if I couldn\\'t revel in your joy? I\\'m revelling baby, believe me!  Mmm hmmm.  Uh-huh.  This is so cool. You\\'re actually gonna be on television.  Would it matter?  I am really not going. I don\\'t get it. They already live together, why do they need to get married?  If you wanna call that a reason.  Look, that has nothing to do with this, ok? She\\'s my ex-wife. If she were marrying a guy, none of you\\'d expect me to be there.  Excellent!  That is so good! Do it again!  No no, that\\'s me.  Oh, hello.  Is everything ok?  Oh my god.  Oh, I believe I had the half-drunk cappuccino with the lipstick on the rim.  And you had no idea they weren\\'t getting along?  No. Look, I told you I am not a part of this thing.  What\\'s the matter?  What?  Carol, what\\'s the matter? What happened?  Oh my god.  It\\'s ok. I\\'m sorry.  I uh can\\'t believe I\\'m gonna say this, but I think Susan\\'s right.  Look, do you love her? And you don\\'t have to be too emphatic about this.  Well then that\\'s it. And if George and Adelaide can\\'t accept that, then the hell with them. Look, if my parents didn\\'t want me to marry you, no way that would have stopped me. Look, this is your wedding. Do it.  Yeah, can\\'t help but.  Ok.  Yeah.  No, that\\'s fine.  Ok.  Well, Mon, I was married.  Hi.  Really.  Whoah, uh, what happened to, uh, \\'Forget relationships! I\\'m done with men!\\' The whole, uh, penis embargo?  Wait-wait. I, I got it. I was there.  Yes. Yes. Yes! Yes, I really do! In fact, it\\'s funny, very often, someone who you wouldn\\'t think could-could curl your toes, might just be the one who...  ...Gets interrupted. Hi!  Alright, I\\'ve gotta go. C\\'mon, Marcel! C\\'mon! We\\'re gonna go take a bath. Yes we are, aren\\'t we? Yes, we are.  That\\'s right, you\\'re gonna spend tomorrow at Aunt Rachel\\'s, aren\\'t you.  \\'Pwease, Aunt Monica, pwease?\\' Oh, unclench. You\\'re not even gonna be there.  I\\'m telling you, she said she\\'s looking for a relationship with someone exactly like me.  Well, I added the \\'exactly like me\\' part... But she said she\\'s looking for someone, and someone is gonna be there tonight.  Well, I think it\\'s perfect. Y\\'know, it\\'s just gonna be the two of us, she spent all day taking care of my monkey...  Anyway, I figured after work I\\'d go pick up a bottle of wine, go over there and, uh, try to woo her.  Hey. How did, uh, how\\'d it go today?  Yeah. You, uh, you want some?  Oh, what? What-what?  ...Yeah?  No, y\\'know what, I guess it\\'s partially my fault. Y\\'know, I shouldn\\'t\\'ve, uh, asked you to start off with a monkey. I should\\'ve started you off with like a pen or a pencil.  You called Animal Control?  Marcel is an illegal exotic animal. I\\'m not allowed to have him in the city. If they find him, they\\'ll take him away from me.  That\\'s right, I.. \\'cause I didn\\'t expect you were gonna invite them to the apartment!  Yeah, we thought we had a monkey, but we-we didn\\'t.  Cat!  My uncle Marcel.  Marcel?  Marc- oh, this is ridiculous! We\\'ve been all over the neighbourhood. He\\'s gone, he\\'s-he\\'s just gone.  Yeah, yeah. Y\\'know, now that you kicked the sign, hey! I don\\'t miss Marcel any more!  Oh, no no no. Nono, this is just vintage Rachel. I mean, things just sort of happen around you. I mean, you\\'re off in Rachel-land, doing your Rachel-thing, totally oblivious to people\\'s monkeys, or to people\\'s feelings...  I don\\'t even wanna hear it, you\\'re just...  Oh, forget it, okay?  What? What?  Hi, did you order some bananas?  Gimme back my monkey.  Marcel? Marcel? Okay, where is he? Where is he? Marcel? Marcel?  Marcel! What\\'ve you done to him?  Okay, gimme my monkey back.  Alright, I want my monkey.  Listen, I\\'m- I\\'m sorry I was so hard on you before, it\\'s just I...  Yeah, but you were the one who got him back, y\\'know? You, you were great. ...Hey, we uh, we still have that, uh, that bottle of wine. You in the mood for, uh, something grape?  We have got to start locking that door!  Who’s Chip?  The guy who took Rachel to the prom? Why is he calling you?  Monica, you’re so lucky! He’s like the most popular guy in school!!  Why? Did you write it?  Well ah, actually...  Well, umm, why don’t you give him a call?  Oh, I’m sure.  I’m reading your ad.  Yeah.  Good, so do I  Are you sure she’s in the cat, or have you been taking your grandma’s glycoma medicine again?  So you guys having any luck getting rid of the entertainment center?  So Pheebs, how long is your mom gonna be with us?  So, guys, am I crazy, or does Phoebe’s mom remind anyone of a cat?  Come on, you-you can’t tell me you actually believe that-that there’s a woman inside that cat!  No you don’t.  No you do—y\\'know what, you’re not gonna suck me into this.  Yes, we have to tell her!  Thank you.  Hi! Listen uhh, this cat belongs to a little girl. There are flyers all over the place.  No! No! Look—Hey, enough is enough! Look, I am sorry that you feel guilty or whatever about spending time with your new mom, but this is not your old mom. This is a cat! Okay, Julio the cat! Not mom! Cat!  None.  I’m sorry.  I don’t know what to say.  Oh! Y\\'know, I’ve got an extra futon.  Hi.  Hello.  Yeah, huh.  What?  Come on sweetie! You’ve had to work late every night for the past two weeks, what is it this time?  Okay.  Hmmm. Oh, no, no, I just thinking about something funny I heard today. Umm, Mark, Mark saying ‘I’ll see you Saturday.’  Oh, no, no, no, it’s-it’s not the lecture ah, I mind, umm....  Oh, well...  Well, I’m sorry, but ah, look if you’re not working with him anymore, why do you have to still do stuff with him?  Okay, but do you really need another friend? I mean...  Is that funny? Am I supposed to be laughing?  Pa-haa!! I would love to go with you.  Yeah, hey I-I have clothes, I even pick them out. I mean for, for all you know I could be a fashion..... monger.  What should I wear, now I’m all nervous.  Come on! Forty-five minutes! Forty-five minutes the man talked about strappy backed dresses.  First of all it’s Professor Pittain! And second of all, that little bone, proved that, that particular dinosaur had wings, but didn’t fly.  Y\\'know what, 100 million people went to see a movie about what I do, I wonder how many people would go see a movie called, Jurassic Parka.  No. I... I wanted to be with you. I don’t know, I feel like lately, I feel like you’re slipping away from me, y\\'know. With this new job, and all these new people, and you’ve got this whole other life going on. I-I-I know it’s dumb, but I hate that I’m not a part of it.  That’s a little clearer.  Is everything okay?  What\\'s going on?  Oh God, here we go!  All right, I gotta go. I\\'m taking Ben to the park.  All right, bye!  Uhh, not much. You guys want to see a movie tonight?  I don\\'t know, umm…  What\\'s with her?  Okay.  Action.  Dude, you are sick.  I just wanna say good-bye to you guys and to see if you guys will place a little bet for me, huh? Twenty bucks on black 15.  All right!  Phoebe, are you, are you mad at me, or something? \\'Cause if are please, tell me what it is I did!  Well, I don\\'t know.  Well, whatever it is I\\'m-I\\'m very, very sorry. Okay?  Okay. So we\\'re, we\\'re good?  ALL RIGHT!! Phoebe now come on! Will you please tell me what it is I did that mad you so mad at me!  Well if you can\\'t remember, can\\'t we just forget about this?  Okay, are you mad at me because my hair gel smells?  Are you angry at me because I said your handwriting is childlike?  Hey!  What do you like better flora or fauna?  Who would you rather be Simon or Garfunkle?  Why are you mad at me?  When did I say you were boring?!  Phoebe! You and I have never played chess!  Hey Rach, can you pass me the TV Guide?  Uh Joey, can you give us just a minute?  What?  Hey, where’s uh, where’s mom?  What about Ben?  Oh well yeah, actually I was going to talk to her when you guys all came in the room.  Yeah right.  What?! When have I ever touched myself in front of you guys?  Dad seriously! Y’know you really should see someone about that!  I wanna go talk to Rachel for a minute, are you gonna be okay alone for a bit?  Dad, what are you doing?  No!  Hi!  What, that we had a baby? Come on let’s give him a little credit, although, he did eat a piece of plastic fruit earlier.  What?  Phoebe, there is no secret. Okay? I didn’t propose.  No! No, come on let her sleep! She’s so exhausted.  I didn’t give her that ring!  No!  It’s mine.  Yes!  No!  No!!  Look. Look, my mom gave me that ring because she wanted me to propose to Rachel, but all I wanted to do is if she maybe…kinda…wanted ah…start…things up again.  Look, I didn’t want to rush into anything. And it seemed like she didn’t want to either. But I don’t, I don’t understand how any of this happened! What? Did she find the ring in my jacket, assume that I was going to propose, throw it on, and-and just start telling people?  Hey.  Listen, I um… I heard about the engagement.  And confused. Rach, sweetie, I-I um…I didn’t propose to you.  I don’t think you do.  Poor baby, you’re so tired. Rach, I didn’t propose to you, Joey didn’t propose to you, and Chandler didn’t propose to you.  Joey proposed to you?  Hey, wait! Wait-wait-wait! Joey, did you propose to her?  Wait! Whoa-whoa, you…you gave her the ring?  Whoa! You were down on one knee?  Then what did happen?  Whoa! Hey! Whoa-whoa-whoa, you saw her breast?!  What?!  Uhh… No.  But I-I was going to see if y’know, maybe you uh, start dating again but that—I mean that-that was all, Rach.  No, you didn’t!  Hey, I’m not going to rush into anything!  What?  Good weird?  We’re so lucky.  Look, I-I know it’s not a proposal and I don’t know where you are, but with everything that’s been going on and with Emma and…I’ve been feeling…  Yeah?  Okay, well, that… Wow, okay, well, umm…then maybe, at least we can, we can talk about us again.  Well good, okay. I-I, kind of think y’know if we…if… You’re wearing the ring.  And you told Phoebe you were engaged.  When you thought Joey proposed did…did you say yes?  People can hear you.  Yeah.  That is one good looking man!  Dude!  Hey!  Well, Kathy gets half-naked and simulates sex with a real good lookin’ guy.  Oh-oh, Alec Baldwin and Kim Basinger.  Yeah.  They’re not a couple!  Oh yeah!  No.  Y’know what, I don’t know how comfortable I am going to see how hot the sex is between some guy and your girlfriend.  Oh no-no-no, I’m there.  Oh yeah!  Somebody seems to be missing being the hostess.  All right, let’s not jump to any conclusions. All right? There was some sexual chemistry between them.  Here she comes. Don’t say a word, okay? Just be cool, don’t be…y\\'know you.  Hey!  Uh, hello!  Oh, yumm!  Cookies and porn, you’re the best mom ever!!  Yeah, how does Jason look in a v-neck?  So you were right?  Chandler!  He’s right, what she did was unforgivable.  How might you be wrong?  That’s all you’re basing this on?  So the first time you ask a guy out, he-he turns you down?  Oh my God!  This is beautiful!  Look, Mon, do you want us to uh, come back later?  Hey!  What are you saying?  Well, if-if she thought they were on a break…  Oh thanks. Although it kinda seemed like you were falling asleep there a little.  Yeah, a lot of my students do that.  Okay, I-I’ll see you tonight.  Okay, bye.  Ah, it’s good. It’s going good. I mean, we get along great. She’s, she’s so…  Well, I was gonna say sweet, but yeah-huh!  Well I…I haven’t actually told her yet. I don’t want to scare her off, y’know?  Uh actually, sorry I can’t even make it. I’m seeing Mona again tonight.  Uh that’s an eighteenth century Indian artifact from Calcutta.  So much more.  Y’know this is actually not a great time for me.  Who did?!  No! No sir umm, she means a lot to me. I mean, I care—I-I love Rachel.  I’m sorry. Dr. Green, Mona. Mona, Dr. Green.  I was going to tell you, but…  No! No! No! No! No! I-I-I-I—I need to, I need to lie down.  So your dad dropped by. He’s a pleasant man!  I don’t care about your dad! I care about Mona! She was there and now she’s totally freaked out!  Rachel!  Okay!  Thank you!  Thank you so much for coming back over.  Focus.  Yeah.  Trying to date this woman.  Probably shouldn’t touch me.  Should I leave this open for you too?  Because what’s going on with Rachel has nothing to do with how I feel about you.  I know and I was going to, but I thought it was better that you heard it from Rachel’s father. Look I…I made a mistake, but it’s only because I really, really like you. Really!  Y\\'know if we ever go to war and you’re captured, you’re in for a big surprise.  Well umm, y’know, I used to play.  Yeah, just a little in high school, but then I really got into it in college. I mean that’s-that’s when I really found my sound.  Yeah.  Really? No. I mean, nah, I haven’t played in so long, and-and, well it’s-it’s really personal stuff, y’know?  Okay, guys.  Really?! I mean, really?!!  Oh, thanks, thanks. So Monica tells me that uh, you don’t want to play anymore because me and y\\'know my talent. Is that true?  Pheebs…  See but, Pheebs that-that is the exact opposite intent of my music. Y’know my music is-is meant to inspire, and if it bothers you this much, then I… I won’t play anymore.  Yeah, okay.  Hey Chandler! Saw the new furniture. Very nice.  What?  No the-the sad thing is, if you had told him how you felt before you kissed her, knowing Joey, he probably just would’ve just stepped aside.  Well, I said-I said something to Phoebe.  Hey, would it be okay if I wrote a song about this.  Yeah, like I could lose it.  I played bad on purpose guys.  Yeah—no, just that last song.  She seems really, really fun!  What?!  So that’s two of my wives.  No. Rachel hooked me up with a tux! But not just any tux, Batman’s tux!  That’s right! Made expressly for Val Kilmer and worn by him in the hit film…that Batman film he was in.  So?  Well, you need something to make this day special? Hello! You-you-you have the most special thing of all! You are marrying the woman you love.  Pretty please? Not very uh, 007.  When I got married you slept with my sister.  Hey!  Yes. I find it to be something of a conversation piece.  Well that stinks. I was looking forward to us wearing our celebrity tuxes together.  What are you kidding? It’s Batman’s tux!!  Okay, but just the jacket. Double-oh and seven are not gettin’ in there.  What?  Uh, I don’t know, whatever.  Oh, I know. Y’know what, I never would’ve gotten this if it weren’t for you. No really, when I’m with you I’m-I’m like this whole other guy, I love that guy! I mean, I love you too, a lot, but that guy! I-I love that guy!  Yeah?  Then don’t. Stay here. Just don’t go so soon to London, just one more day.  One more day, seriously/  So, then you can stay as long as you want.  Yeah, I know, I uh, I tried them on.  No. No, I didn’t. I didn’t want to be that guy.  Oh yeah, Emily convinced me to do it.  I like it, and Emily likes it, and that’s what counts. So uh, how are you guys doing?  Ugh, she’s saying good-bye to her uncle.  Yeah!! Yeah!  I just, I hate this so much! I mean, every time I go pick her up at the airport, it’s-it’s so great. But at the same time I’m thinking, \"Well, I’m gonna be right back there in a couple of days, dropping her off.\"  Nothing! There’s nothing to do! I mean, she lives there, I live here. I mean, she-she’d have to uh, move here. She should move here!  I could ask her to live with me!  I mean, why not! I mean, I mean why not?!  Look guys, when I’m with her it’s-it’s-it’s like she brings this-this-this great side out of me. I mean I-I-I love her, y’know?  I don’t want to do that.  Hey!  Don’t be scared, I-I know it sounds crazy and-and people will say it’s too soon, but just-just think, think how great it will be.  I know.  Well, so, you-you’ll get a job here! I mean, I’m always hearing about uh, them foreigners coming in here and stealing American jobs; that could be you!  No, I can’t. I would, I really would, but my son is here; I can’t leave him. Isn’t—you don’t think there’s any way?  What?  No, no, don’t. Why don’t we?  Get married.  No! No! I’m not! It’s-it’s-it’s perfect! I mean it’s better than you just-just moving here, ‘cause it’s us together forever, and that’s-that’s what I want.  Yeah, I know, so what? I mean, who’s-who’s to say? Does that me we-we can’t do it? Look, huh, I was with Carol for four years before we got married and I wound up divorced from a pregnant lesbian. I mean, this, this makes sense for us. Come on! I mean, on our first date we ended up spending the whole weekend in Vermont! I mean, last night I got my ear pierced! Me! This feels right. Doesn’t it?  Is that—are you saying yes? Is that yes?  Yes! We’re getting married?!  Yes!  Damn! I thought that was going to be romantic as hell!  Come on! Come on. Come on.  Hey!  Uhh, okay, it’s uh, Emily and I, we decided to uh, to get married.  We, we just decided to uh, to go for it.  Not that big a deal? It\\'s amazing. Ok, you just reach in there, there\\'s one little maneuver, and bam, a bra right out the sleeve. All right, as far as I\\'m concerned, there is nothing a guy can do that even comes close. Am I right?  Multiple orgasms!  Not even, say, breaking up with Janice?  Tony?  That guy, he burns me up.  So, uh, Rachel, what are you, uh, what\\'re you doing tonight?  Oh, you uh, you wanna hear a freaky coincidence? Guess who\\'s doing laundry there too?  Me. Was that not clear? Hey, why don\\'t, um, why don\\'t I just join you both, here?  Yes, I do have a laundry room in my building, um, but there\\'s a.... rat problem. Apparently they\\'re attracted to the dryer sheets, and they\\'re goin\\' in fine, but they\\'re comin\\' out all.... fluffy. Anyway, say, sevenish?  It\\'s laundry. The thinking through is minimal.  Nuh-uh.  So what\\'re you saying here? I should shave again, pick up some wine, what?  Ok, ok, now what is wrong with my Snuggles? What, it says I\\'m a sensitive, warm kinda guy, you know, like a warm, fuzzy bear. Ok, I can pick something else up on the way.  What\\'s goin\\' on?  Was your basket on top?  So?  Hey, hey, hey, that\\'s not the rule and you know it.  Well, that\\'s because you\\'re such a sweet, gentle, uh...Do you, uh, do you...Oh, hey, uh you must need detergent.  Uberveiss. It\\'s new, it\\'s German, it\\'s extra-tough.  Rach, do you uh, are you gonna separate those?  Rach, have you never done this before?  Uh, well, don\\'t worry, I\\'ll use the gentle cycle. Ok, um, basically you wanna use one machine for all your whites, a whole nother machine for colors, and a third for your uh, your uh, delicates, and that would be your bras and your under-panty things.  Nothing, nothing. Lee-lo, the laundry\\'s done.  All right, all right, it\\'s just that you left a red sock in with all your whites, and now, everything\\'s kinda pink.  Yeah, uh, except for the red sock, which is still red. I\\'m sorry, please don\\'t be upset, it could happen to anyone.  You got the clothes clean. Now that\\'s the important part.  You were incredible! Brand new woman, ladies and gentlemen.  No.  Yeah.  Yeah.  What a beautiful story. Hey, I\\'m fine by the way.  Hi!  I\\'d love to!  Phoebe, what happened?  Oh, don\\'t worry about it! Just use your travel insurance.  Well, this is what happens when people live on the edge!  Uh, don\\'t you think that would be a little weird? I mean, two guys in a romantic inn...  Yeah, I ate all my gifts for everybody.  Not there.  Totally insane. Dude, let\\'s drive home, we\\'ll hit all the maple candy stores on the way back and if...if they\\'re closed maybe we\\'ll tap a tree and make some ourselves.  Dude, don\\'t worry \\'bout it! I know how we can make your money back! This is a nice hotel, you know, plenty of amenities, we just load up on those! Like those apples. Instead of taking one, I\\'m... I take six!  C\\'mon, you get the idea, ow-ow-ow we\\'ll make our money back in no time!  I think it\\'s the sugar, could you hold the apple?  What did you get?  Nice, put it with the others.  Oh, that\\'s not cool.  Not my first time in a hotel, my friend.  No, no, no, you can\\'t take the remote control!  Let\\'s celebrate with some maple candy!  At least tell me where you hid it.  Oh dude, don\\'t worry about it, I found an unattended maid\\'s car. We\\'re way ahead of the game.  Oh my god.  There\\'s something new in the bowl.  No, but I want...I want the pinecones!  It\\'s not the same.  Oh, my maple candy!  This screen is amazing, I mean Dick Van Dyke is practically life-size.  Oh you know, pretty much the usual, uh, sun shining, birds chirping.  Bye guys.  I told you there was going to be sub-titles.  It would really help when I\\'m kissing you if you didn\\'t shout out my sister\\'s name.  Oh.  Mon.  Mon.  What, what.  And that\\'s, that\\'s funny why?  I, I know it\\'s big, I just didn\\'t know it was uh, ha-ha big.  OK, my hands were no where near your butt.  No see now, now I can\\'t because uh, I\\'m feeling too self conscious.  Nuh, uh, the moment\\'s gone.  That\\'s romantic.  No.  No.  No.  That was 14 hours ago.  Oh. Listen, have you ever been uh, you know, foolin\\' around with a girl and uh, she started laughin\\'?  Yeah. I don\\'t know, I\\'ve been wanting this since like ninth grade typing, ya know. And I just want it to be perfect and right and. . . why isn\\'t that laser beam cutting through the paint?  Hey.  No, you, ya know there\\'s no need to make it u. . . how?  Humm, that sounds, I don\\'t, perfect.  Hey.  Well we just wanted to stop by and uh, say goodnight.  Look at that, they won\\'t even turn their heads.  Well, why\\'re you all dressed up?  What? You have a date? Who with?  C\\'mon, what\\'s his name?  Come on, tell me.  Oh, I promise, what.  Who\\'s Richard Burke? Doc, Doctor Burke? You have a date with Doctor Burke? Why, why, why should that bother me? I, I love that man, he\\'s like a uh, brother to dad.  Doctor Burke is sexy?  Oh look, I can\\'t believe this. Look, homo-habilus hasn\\'t even learned how to use tools yet and they\\'ve got him here wi, with clay pots. Why don\\'t, why don\\'t they just give him a microwave? I\\'m sorry, I\\'m sorry this is taking so long, ya know, I, I, it\\'s just it\\'s longer than I expected, we will have dinner.  KARL!  Rach.  I\\'m done.  Wha, OK, I\\'m sorry, let\\'s uh, why don\\'t we find someplace else.  No, no, we won\\'t.  Shh. Do you want cran-apple or cran-grape?  Sorry.  Well uh, you see that, that little cluster of stars next to the big one? That is Ursa Major.  I\\'ve no idea, could be. Listen, I\\'m sorry I had to work tonight.  You\\'re not laughing.  What. Oh no, you just rolled over the juice box.  Hi.  I know it is pretty unbelievaaaaah.  Hey!  Come on, she\\'s gonna love you guys!  Hey you guys, I need some fashion advice.  C\\'mon! This looks good!  Damnit! I have this date tomorrow night and I have to look cool!  Really? That would be great. I mean, I have to do something, she kinda teased me about how I dress.  You\\'re wearing the same shirt.  You know, we should just go, I’m not gonna find anything here! This stuff is ridiculous!  Both logic and math are taking a serious hit today.  Wow!  All right, that’s it, I’m getting out of here.  Uh, actually these might look pretty good on me.  Really?  So, you’re saying, uh, if I wear these pants I might be getting into hers?  Oh, I see, somebody is afraid of a little competition with the ladies?  Turns out this sweater is made for a woman.  Because it\\'s soft... Hey, so how was your date?  Well, looks like it\\'s just the two of us tonight, huh old buddy?  Look, you guys I just wanna say, I really, really appreciate you spending this time with me. It’s been a pretty hard time right now, so I just wanna say thanks.  No, no, no, this weekend guys!  What’s going on?  So, for the whole weekend?  Yeah, that’s okay, I mean if you guys all have to go away for the first weekend I’m alone by myself, y\\'know then I totally, totally understand.  What a pity stay?  Pity food? Y\\'know what that’s okay, all right, I don’t need any of you to stay, okay nobody stays.  Well, oh just ah, I was just wondering, when you and I split up, did you get the tape that was half the last episode of M*A*S*H and half the hostages coming home?  Where’s Ben?  Oh! I thought you guys got married in uh, January?  Umm, candles, champagne, yeah anniversaries are great. ‘Cause you know love lasts forever, y\\'know. Nothing like it in this lifetime, money in the bank, so Rachel and I broke up.  Yeah, well.  Oh yeah, I’d love that.  ....right? Right? I mean it’s pretty unbelievable y\\'know, I mean they just took off, took off without even looking back. Y\\'know I don’t, I don’t need them, huh, I’ve got you guys now as friends, you and Susan.  Pheebs? What, why are you whispering?  Oh, now you want a favour?  Well, oh, I’m sorry your car broke down Pheebs, but I’m a little too busy with some of my real friends right now, but please call to let me know you got home safely okay?  No, I’m not gonna pick them up.  No, Rachel doesn’t want me to....  Yeah, you’re right.  Oh, you-you’re-you’re one to talk.  He is saving your butt, ah, unless of course I’m stepping on some toes here, in which case I can just mosey on, I’ve got plenty of people to help on the Interstate.  Excuse me?  Oh-oh, hitting me where it hurts, my ski skills.  All right Pheebs, your cab’s ready.  You’re welcome.  We were on a break!  Hey-hey, it’s valid okay? And I’m not the only one who thinks so, Monica agrees with me.  That’s what you said last night.  Okay.  Obviously not to Joey.  I can.  No, no, really, I’ve got to take the car back anyway, I’m spending all day tomorrow with Ben, It’s fine, no guilt I promise.  Okay.  Okay.  That would be great.  I know!  Oh, great! Listen, oh I had to get you a whole new battery. I got you the best one I could, ‘cause that’s not where you want to skimp.  Yeah, well it came to about $112, but what the hell, just call it an even 110?  Okay.  So they ah, they all took off, it was pretty hard watching them go, y\\'know?  Hey. Oh, oh, how\\'d it go?  That\\'s funny, that, no, because, uh, our parents actually did, uh, send our dog off to live on a farm.  What? Wh- hello? The Millners\\' farm in Connecticut? The Millners, they had this unbelievable farm, they had horses, and, and rabbits that he could chase and it was- it w- .....Oh my God, Chi Chi!  Can I use.. either thumb?  Easy.  What is this?!  Hold on a second, alright? Just think about what you went through the last time you quit.  Yeah, well, you didn\\'t know Chi Chi.  Hey, Pheebs.  ...I\\'ll go. Let\\'s start with the way he kept picking at- no, I\\'m sorry, I can\\'t do this, can\\'t do this. We loved him.  ...What shoe?  ...So I think Alan will become the yardstick against which all future boyfriends will be measured.  You know what I like most about him, though?  The way he makes me feel about myself.  Well..  He was unbelievable. He was like that-that-that Bugs Bunny cartoon where Bugs is playing all the positions, right, but instead of Bugs it was first base-Alan, second base-Alan, third base-...  What?  Yeah, it\\'s his, uh, innate Alan-ness that-that-that we adore.  A thumb?!  Oh, now, don\\'t listen to him, Pheebs, I think it\\'s endearing.  You know, there\\'s nothing wrong with speaking correctly.  Don\\'t you realise what you\\'re-you\\'re doing to yourself?  If only he were a woman.  Hey Pheebs, you gonna have the rest of that Pop-Tart?.. Pheebs?  Hey, I might!  Is there somebody else?  Who-who wants fair? Y\\'know, I just want things back. Y\\'know, the way they were.  Hey hey, we\\'ll be fine. We\\'re just gonna need a little time.  Yeah. He could row like a viking.  So how\\'d it go?  Uh, yeah, I ah, I also need two.  Uh, no, it’s-it’s just this person.  Yeah, kinda. It’s this woman from work. I hope that won’t be too weird. Will it, Rach?  All right, I’ll see you tonight.  Hey, hey Rach!  Hi!  Good.  So it’s looks like we’re the first ones here.  Yay!!  Hey. Oh, I’m sorry, this is Cailin.  And! Break!!  Well y\\'know ‘cause Rachel and I used to go out.  Oh! Well then this is awkward. So what do you uh…  Oh! Yeah.  Go? Why?  But-but Cailin, he definitely will scream.  Uh, oh-ho bye.  One.  Look. Look, I wasn’t going to say anything to you, but... All right, I don’t think you should be seeing Tommy anymore.  No! The guy is mean. I mean really mean. I think you should stay away from him.  Whoa, sorry Tommy.  Umm…  Okay, it’s coffee.  It’s-it’s hot…  No, but it’s-it’s-it’s hot!  I can’t believe no one believes me!  You do Pheebs?  Phoebe, 800 is toll free, 801 is-is Utah.  Faded salmon color.  Great! Great. Then I must’ve left it at Mona’s. I knew it!  That’s my favorite shirt! Okay? I love that shirt!  Hello!!  Not touching myself if that makes anyone less uncomfortable.  You do?  I\\'m sorry I\\'m late, what happened?  Well, we should probably get going.  My baby sister, ladies and gentlemen.  G\\'night.  Tell me about it. So what, what\\'s your magic number?  C\\'mon, you know everyone I\\'ve been with. All, both of them.  Better not be doin\\' these in order.  Oh yes, the weenie from Torrini.  Really?  Oh, hey, if I make you laugh, here\\'s an idea, why don\\'t you invite Paulo over and have a little romp in the sack and I\\'ll just stand in the corner and tell knock-knock jokes.  Animal sex, animal sex? So what\\'re you saying, I mean, you\\'re saying that like, there\\'s nothing between us animal at all. I mean there\\'s not even like, uhm, a little animal, not even, not even like, like chipmunk sex?  Knock-knock.  Good, good, good. So, is uh, was your moustache, did, used to be different?  Oh. How do you uh, ya know, keep it so neat?  Oh. And what do you call that?  So were you in Nam?  No, no way. You\\'ve got it totally the other way around my friend. John Voit was...  Yeah.  Yeah.  C\\'mon.  Open up. We want to talk to you.  How could you not tell us?  Hey.  Hey.  Oh man.  You got it.  I don\\'t want to.  Yeah.  Oh c\\'mon. Maybe you\\'re just, uhhh... paying your dues.  Yeah, yeah, just a tough day at work. A stegosaurus fell over and trapped a kid. Whoa, whoa, I know this jacket, this is, th--Fun Bobby\\'s jacket! Where is he, what. He, he\\'s here, isn\\'t he?  Don\\'t toy with me.  Hey, Fun Bobby!  Not at all! I love this guy. Hey, I was so psyched to hear you\\'re back with my sister!  Oooooh.  Yeah but, you know, now that I think about it, I don\\'t think I\\'ve ever seen Fun Bobby without a... a drink in his hand.  What? What\\'s wrong?  Alright.  Hi.  Yes, yes I am. Are you a, uh, a friend of Rachel\\'s?  A date.  Oh, oh, you\\'re... uh... you\\'re, oh you\\'re the date.  Yes, yes I am. And you are a....  Well, I am going to, uh... get a beverage. It was nice, nice... uh... meeting you.  I, uh, well... I... I met Russ.  Hey, I didn\\'t know we were, uh, seeing other people.  Well, uh, for your information, there\\'s a woman at the museum, who\\'s curator of moths and other... uh... winged things... who\\'s, uh, let it be known that she is drawn to me much like a... well, you know. But so far I\\'ve been keeping her at bay, but, uh, if this is the deal...  OK, well, um, have a nice evening.  What do you mean?  See what? I don\\'t know what she sees in... innn that goober. And it takes him, what? Like... like... I don\\'t know, uhh... uhhh, hello.... a... week, to get out a sentence.  ....................Yeah.  Oh you do, do you?  Of... of what?  Hey, you\\'re a doctor of gums. That\\'s the smallest body part you can major in. It\\'s like day one, floss. Day two, here\\'s your diploma.  No, no, let me finish.  No, you let me fini...  Hi.  Where ya goin\\'?  Ooooohhhh.  What\\'s going on, is... uh, Bobby drinking again?  How\\'d the callback go?  Good for you.  Ironically, most of the boxes seem to be labeled clothes.  Hey! Hey! If he\\'s moving, maybe I should try to get his place!  It would be so cool to live across from you guys!  Oh my God! I love this apartment! Isn\\'t it perfect?! I can\\'t believe I never realized how great it is!  What?! What?!  Well, I called over there and it turns out Ugly Naked Guy is subletting it himself and he\\'s already had like a hundred applicants.  No-no, I got the edge. I know it\\'s not exactly ethical but I sent him a little bribe to  No.  No.  A basket of mini-muffins.  The small one.  Well yeah! Someone sent us a basket at work once and people went crazy over those little muffins. It was the best day.  Noooo.  Look I\\'ve already looked at like a thousand apartments this month and none of them even compares to that one!  Huh?  That is a great idea! And! I know Ugly Naked Guy because we\\'ve been watching him for like five years so that gives me back my edge! Oh, let\\'s see now he had the trampoline.  Well, he had gravity boots.  A new place for a new Ross. I\\'m gonna have you and all the guys from work over once it\\'s y\\'know, furnished.  Well I am that. And that whole rage thing is definitely behind me.  Pffhah.  Nothing, it’s just that hypnosis is beyond crap.  Hey, that guy did not hypnotise me! Okay.  Here you go.  Exactly, it’ll be illegal for him to drink at his own bachelor party.  And so now you guys are gonna be married?  Pheebs, what, is it the age thing?  Pheebs, if you don’t tell him, soon he’s gonna be married, and then you’re gonna hate yourself.  All we’re saying is don’t rush into anything.  Yeah, he-he’s right, he’s right. This is your time y\\'know, yeah, you’re young, you’re-you’re weird, chicks dig that.  No the man’s right, that’s what I had with Rachel.  No, I ah, I slept with someone else.  It didn’t.  Yeah, yeah.  Don’t ask me, I had it and I blew it!  Oh, no! No!  I’m the ring bearer.  Hi!  Just a high pitched intimidating noise.  Mr. Morse I need to talk to you about your mid-term exam, I’m afraid I-I had to fail you.  Well you need 60% to pass…  Seven.  No-no it’s not. What-what happened there Ned?  Well I’m sorry but, that-that’s really not my problem.  Well that brings me in the loop a little.  Can I ask you something? Have you ever had a guy have a crush on you?  There’s this kid in my class who said he’s in love with me.  I do-I do not have a boyfriend. There’s a guy in one of my classes who-who has a crush on me.  It-it—The point is my natural charisma has made him fail his midterm.  Yeah. I guess I can cut him some slack.  No!  Well that’s different! Okay? Because he, he was actually in love with me!  What?  I can’t believe someone would do that for a grade.  Uh Mr. Morse, can I speak to you for a moment?  Uh-hmm, yeah-yeah do you like it? Do-do you looove it? I just want you to know that I’m changing your grade back.  ‘Cause I know what you’re trying to pull here. Okay? It’s not gonna work.  Oh cool!  Well do you want some help?  Awesome!  I’m sorry, I don’t believe contestants are allowed to talk to each other.  The wheel has not been my friend tonight Joey. Uh, I’ll take another question.  It’s okay, I’m ready.  It’s possible, they have really sharp edges.  Wait a minute, I-I believe I’m entitled to use my Angel Pass for a free turn?  Y’know what? You’re just upset because you’re losing.  What?!  Shut up! I Dream of Genie!  I’d like to spin the wheel!  Is there a hopping bonus?  Ben Franklin.  Queen Victoria.  Noooo!!! Every time!!!  Yeah!!  Wow! It looks like we got a lot of good stuff.  Uh, what?  What—You’re not serious. I mean she’s a very nice woman, but there is no way we can take eight weeks of her. She’ll drive us totally crazy.  Well we…we don’t have a garage.  Y’know what? Maybe, Mrs. Green, it’s not absolutely vital that you live with us.  I’m-I’m sure that’s not true.  Well uh, y’know what? Even if she doesn’t know anything, I do! I have a son. And his mother and I didn’t live together, and whenever he was with me I took care of him all the time, by myself.  Yeah.  That’s a different issue. Uh, the point is, when the baby comes I will be there to…to feed her and bathe her and change her. And more than that I want to do all those things.  Yes! Yes, you’re gonna be so missed.  Look at you! What—You’re-you’re this big executive! You are much more capable than you give yourself credit for. I-I have no doubt you’re gonna be an incredible mother.  I’m telling you.  You sure?  Excellent! How do you put a baby down for a nap?  Excellent! Excellent, now-now do you want another question or a Wicked Wango card?  Joey, you shouldn\\'t lie on your résumé.  You guys know where Rachel is?  Hey!  What? She\\'s gonna eat all those cookies?  So, why is Erica coming to visit?  No, no, no, I\\'m sure you have a great excuse, wh-was it a hair appointment, a mani-pedi or was there a sale at Barney\\'s?  Oh my God.  Is-is he ok?  Ok, ok. I\\'m gonna come out to Long Island with you, I mean, you can\\'t be alone right now.  Still-still, let me come... for me.  I bet someone could use one of Monica\\'s freshly baked cookies.  Oh!  And I\\'m Doctor Ross Geller.  Rach, I think I\\'m gonna wait out here, because my throat is feeling a little scratchy, I don\\'t want to infect him.  I\\'m not scared of him, I\\'m really sick!  I\\'m feeling better.  He\\'s unconscious, I think we\\'ll be just fine!  Did the TV wake you?  Ouchy.  Right, is it painful?  Nope, just the one. RACH!  Hey!  Oh, yeah. Emma\\'s doing great.  Wow.  Just can\\'t believe I\\'m in Rachel Green\\'s room.  Yeah, sure, right! Like I\\'ve ever been in Rachel Green\\'s room.  You had a rough day, uh?  What? No, no! Hey, hey, hey look...  They gave him a lot of medication, ok? He wouldn\\'t even know if you were there. Look, we\\'ll go see him first thing in the morning, ok?  No, God! Hey, Rach, you\\'ve been an amazing daughter, ok? Right now you just need to get some rest.  Sure!  Oh, of course...  No, look, uh. You are upset about your father and you\\'re feeling vulnerable and I just don\\'t feel it would be right, I\\'d feel like I\\'d be, you know, taking advantage of you.  Look, I\\'m sure it would be great, but I-I think one of us has to be thinking clearly, so, I\\'m gonna go!  Hey Rach, can you grab me a cup of coffee?  You\\'ve been quiet all morning. Is everything okay?  You sure you\\'re alright?  I can\\'t believe this. I was just being a good guy. I treated you with respect and understanding.  Hey, I was looking out for you.  I gotta say, I have not had sex a lot of times before, this is the worst ever.  Hey you know what? You know what? To avoid this little thing in the future, let\\'s just say, you and me, never having sex again.  Emma\\'s down for the night.  So uh... I guess I wanna take off.  Oh, no problem.  Thank you. I\\'m glad you agree.  Yeah... Yeah, that\\'s true.  Oh, ye-ah!  ...Valentine\\'s day...  Hmmm-mmmm.  Not even once.  Even if we want it really bad.  Uhm, right!  Yeah.  ...I hate waste.  Yes?  So, uh, what kinda stuff do you think they\\'ll have you do there?  You know, if I didn\\'t already have a job, I think, I would have been really good in advertising.  Oh, I can\\'t. I\\'ve got a date with that waitress, Katy, yeah, I know we\\'ve been only going out like twice, but I have a really good feeling about her.  Yeah, a real pleasure.  Hey, you\\'ll never guess what just happened… Phoebe and I got mugged!  Yeah, it was pretty traumatic. I was outside St. Marc\\'s Comics… you know, I-I-I was just there minding my own business, you know, seeing what kinda trouble spiderman got into that week-  I know! And-and the worst part was they took my backpack which had all the original artwork I had done for my own comic book: \"Science Boy\"  A superhuman thirst for knowledge.  Hey!  No one ever asked me that, what\\'s wrong?  No, it wasn\\'t.  No, it wasn\\'t. You don\\'t think I would\\'ve defended myself against a fourteen year-old…  It\\'s not the best!  You really thought \"Science Boy\" was worth saving!  Still… this is amazing… Oh my god, thank you, Phoebe.  You\\'re welcome.  I see. You didn\\'t happen to tell…  Really? Which one?  Except for \"Match game\"...  Oh, and Chandler and I have this stupid college alumni thing. I can\\'t believe you get to meet Donny Osmond.  So weird to see all these people again... Oh my God, look, there\\'s Geoffrey Cleric.  He was roommates with John Rosoff. He went out with Andrea Tamburino. She dumped him for Michael Skloff.  Hey, there\\'s Missy Goldberg. You gotta remember her.  Dude. You\\'re married to my sister.  Hey, I hear she\\'s single again, d\\'you think I should ask her out?  Yes please.  Hey. Hey, check out the flyers for the band. I made \\'em on a Macintosh in the computer room!  Thanks to a little something called \"Helvetica Bold 24 point\"!  Hey, Missy...  Yeah, yeah. You should come check us out. We\\'re called \"Way! No Way!\".  Boss!  She\\'s gone.  Dude, I was gonna ask her out.  Well, I thought it first, Holmes.  Woha! Wait... What are we doing? What we have is too important to mess it up over some girl. I mean, we can get laid anytime we want.  Me too. I\\'m good at it.  You got it.  Those are the pacts!  Oh, oh... maybe not you!  So, Saturday night!  Great!  Oh, well, uh, this is gonna sound kinda silly, but, do you remember my roommate Chandler Bing?  It\\'s been sixteen years but the air quotes still hurt.  That\\'s ok. Uh, anyway, well he and I both really liked you a lot, uhm, but we didn\\'t want anything to jeopardize our friendship, so we kinda made a pact, that neither of us could ask you out!  Yeah, why?  You did?  You broke the pact!  That doesn\\'t matter! We\\'re talking about the foundation of our friendship.  I didn\\'t.  No.  NO!  I never did anything with Adrienne Turner.  I don\\'t know what... you\\'re talking about.  Listen Adrienne, you can\\'t tell Chandler about this.  I didn\\'t know you knew about that.  So, eh. I made out with Adrienne and you made out with Missy. Well I guess we\\'re even.  We are even, right?  Hey, where\\'s Rachel?  Did you know Chandler kissed Rachel?  Nineteen Eighty Seven. The weekend you guys visited me at school.  Well, it matters to me.  Because... the night you kissed Rachel was the night I kissed Rachel for the very first time.  Okay, after you told me she was passed out in our room, I went in there to make sure she was all right. She was lying on my bed, all buried in peoples coats. Well, I went to kiss her on the forehead, you know. But it was so dark, I accidentally got her lips. I started to pull away, but then I felt her start to kiss me back. It was only for a second, but... it was amazing. And now, now I find out that you kissed her first.  Mine.  No, she was definitely on my bed.  Well, then who was on my bed?  You were under the pile of coats?  OH MY GOD!  You were my first kiss with Rachel?  I can\\'t believe you guys are moving in together. That\\'s, that\\'s great! I mean...I\\'m happy for you guys..  Phoebe, I had no idea you were so conventional.  Hey!  Oh great now you\\'re seeking me out to make jokes? I mean I can see for all hanging out but to come to my home!  Why?  Never?  wow, are you still going to move in with him?  Yeah, marriage... stinks! I mean if you wanna see a man gain weight and a woman stop shaving? Get them married.  No, I\\'m sorry. Look I don\\'t think that\\'s what you wanna hear right now but I can\\'t help it. I love marriage.  If you have to call me name, I prefer \"Ross the Divorcer\". It\\'s just cooler. Look, I know my marriage isn\\'t exactly work out. But I love to be that committed to another person. And Carol had some good times before she became a lesbian... and once afterward. I\\'m sorry.  But come on! I mean living together will be great! I mean you guys have so much fun and you love Mike.  Yeah see? And you are so excited about moving in together before, and you know what? You should be. It\\'s a big deal!  The Divorcer, to the rescue!  Yeah I just hurt it.  Hey! What do you guys think about this. \"Ross: The Divorce-Force\".  Hey Pheebs, you know I\\'m i\\'m really glad you came to talk to me the other day and I hope I was a little helpful.  Good, good. Yeah coz the more I thought about it, the more I realised I don\\'t think marriage is neccessarily the right path for you.  Well, I know the other day in the coffeehouse you were caught up in the whole soccer mom thing? but is that really you? I mean can you honestly picture yourself in a Volvo?  I don\\'t know you\\'d be so bored with marriage. I mean it\\'s so... normal.  Hey hey, can I help?  You know sometimes your words... they hurt.  No, but come on, we’re off to a great start aren’t we? I knew I’d get you here fast, but this has got to be some kind of a record!  Wait a minute! How-how the hell did you beat us here?  N… No! We took a cab too, but I did test runs!  Okay is there…some kind of magic tunnel to this hospital?!  Yeah?  I really think they’re out of rooms.  What-what?  Thank you.  Hi! Hi, I’m uh Ross. I’m here to ruin this magical day for you.  Hi Julie.  Yeah.  Oh, okay.  What?  Oh. Okay, just breathe.  Uh yes! Thank you.  Later.  Hi! I’m so glad you’re here, but it’s gonna be a while. I-I wished you’d called first.  Oh good.  Okay, what’s up?  Ma, you’re asking me to marry you?  Mom no, come on! Thank you.  N-no! Okay? We’ve been through this! We’re not gonna get married just because she’s pregnant, okay?  Mom, y’know what? I-I can’t deal with this right now. I’m sorry…  …she came and dragged me out of the labor room to ask me why I’m not with Rachel.  Are you kidding? Look, we’re not gonna be together just because we’re having a baby. Okay?  Okay, stop it! I can’t deal with this right now. I have to go have a baby.  What happened to the Disgustingtons?  Wow! Sorry. So uh, how are the new people?  Yeah? Okay.  Just ignore them.  What? What?  The nurse said they’re bringing in another woman.  That’s it. That’s it.  Just three?! I’m dilated three!  Uh Rach…  And yet somehow it’s true!  Oh there you go!  No-no. We…  Um uh…We’re-we’re just having this baby together but uh, uh that’s all.  Uh well umm…we’re just not in that place, y’know? But we’re very excited about this.  Sid you lucky deaf bastard.  Hey!  Not just Janice, Janice in labor, contracting and everything.  Y’know what I think it is? I think you’ve made such a nice home for her over the last nine months that she just doesn’t want to leave.  Sweetie you’re doing great.  What is that?  Oh thank God, I thought she had two heads.  Go!  Yes you can!  Hey! Hey! Come on! You can! I know you can do this! Let’s go!  Oh! Oh! She’s upside down but she’s coming! She’s coming!  Oh! Oh my God oh! Oh my God she’s here.  Oh she’s…she’s perfect.  Oh it’s okay. They’re just-they’re just wrapping her up.  Oh, come in.  The doctor says it’s completely normal with all the hormones. Plus, you-you’re sleep deprived.  Uh actually, we-we’ve narrowed it down to two names.  Umm, Delilah.  So I guess we’re back to uh, Baby Girl.  Ugh, easy for you to say, you already know what your kids names are going to be.  No-no. No.  Okay.  Man! Did you see the kid on that nose?  Huh?  Yeah. Yeah, it really was. But we…we gotta be careful. We…we can’t let that happen again, y’know?  I mean we don’t want to go down that road do we?  Oh my God! I’m sorry, I was talking to this nurse, completely forgot.  Look at Emma!  Oh what are you kidding? She’s gorgeous, it’s all Rachel.  It’s…it’s complicated okay?  Yeah, exactly.  Hey! What\\'s up?  Hey Joey! Great stuff huh?  You got ink on your lip.  I don\\'t, I don\\'t think we\\'ve meet. I-I\\'m Ross.  I had just moved in. Thank you! Listen umm…  Umm?  I will give you a call.  Okay!  So uhh, you ready?  Mon, speaking of which, dad says he knows someone you can call for an interview.  On behalf of everyone, I\\'d just like to say behuh.  Freakish.  Oh yeah.  Yeah alright.  Oh, sorry we didn\\'t know.  Uh, nothing, nothing\\'s with him. Enjoy your coffee.  Ok, ok, you know what? I think you\\'re very funny. Kudos on that hat joke. But, come on guy just, just give him back the hat.  It was ridiculous. Ya know, these guys, they were bullies, actual bullies, ya know. We\\'re grown ups, this kinda stuff isn\\'t supposed to happen anymore.  Hi.  What?  Do you say this stuff to girls?  You\\'re joking, right? You guys just walked through the door.  Alright, that\\'s it. I\\'ve had enough of this, alright. Gunther, these guys are trying to take our seat.  Thank you Gunther. We didn\\'t want to have to go and do that.  I know.  Let\\'s, let\\'s take this outside? Who talks like that?  Yeah.  Ok, ok look, see, the thing is we\\'re, we\\'re not gonna fight you guys.  Thank you.  Absolutely.  How come it\\'s not mixing with the water?  No.  No. Man I don\\'t wanna have to have Joey with me every time I wanna descent cup of coffee. Ya know, and I don\\'t wanna spend the rest of my life drinking cappucino with a \\'K\\'. I say you and I go back down there and stand up to those guys.  Yeah, sure.  No. So what. So what if we get beaten up, maybe that\\'s just something every man has to go through once in his life. Ya know, like a, like a right of passage or somethin\\'.  Well we did it, we\\'re here. We are standing our ground. How long does a cup of coffee take?  I think we proved our point.  Cannot feel my tounge.  Yes, and that\\'s why we\\'re here.  Woah, ho-ho, whad\\'ya got there, a weapon?  Whad\\'ya mean?  Before I forget, are we hitting faces?  Well because I have to work on Monday, I have a big presentation.  Hey, hey, woah, you want some of this, huh? You want a piece of this, huh? I\\'m standin here, huh.  Hey.  God, that was, that was amazing, that was incredible. You guys, you guys kicked butt.  Yeah he was wasn\\'t he.  So, listen guys, are we uh, are we ok here?  Alright.  Hey, I thought I\\'d end up kissing Charlie too ok? But SURPRISE!  Yes, she is this new professor of my department that I did not kiss.  Why do you care so much?  Oh, I don\\'t know, they seem to have a shared interest in each other\\'s tonsils...  Yeah, it\\'s no big deal. I mean, I just met her and I\\'m fine with it...  Oh, God. I forgot how hot she was!  I\\'m gonna get some more coffee.  Uhm no! Think less of you! No, I don\\'t think less of you. I mean, you saw someone you liked and you kissed them. I mean, those people who like someone and don\\'t kiss them... those-those people are stupid, I hate those people.  Yeah, I know the type.  Hi!  Look, if you don\\'t know what the word \"acrimonious\" means, just don\\'t use it!  Get to the problem!  You were saying you didn\\'t want to seem stupid.  You know, I really don\\'t want to get involved in you guy\\'s relationship.  Ok. Let\\'s see. Oh, you should take her to the MET!  Oh, no! The MET! The Metropolitan Museum of Art.  Yeah, most of it it\\'s a place packed with confused angry baseball fans!  Yeah, uh, uh, ok, there\\'s this great rare bookstore on Madison Avenue. You know what? She loves architecture, you know what you should do? You should take a walk down fifth to the Saint Patrick\\'s Cathedral and there there\\'s this great little pastry shop that she\\'d love.  Ok.  Ok, when you walk in the museum, take the right, that\\'s the antiquities wing. Ancient Egypt, Mesopotamia, up to the Byzantine Empire.  Now, do you have any idea what you just said?  Ok now, remember, when you get to the museum, Monet is not spelt M-O-N-A-Y. I just... I wrote that out phonetically for you.  Yeah, yeah that means... you know? We just... we don\\'t have time for this.  Ok, but you know what? I gotta say, I\\'m really impressed that you were able to memorize all this so quickly!  Wow. What does that mean?  Ok! So let\\'s move on to the Renaissance?  Haha! Got ya! Die, die, die!  Hey, how was the Met?  Yeah? Joey really knows his art, huh?  What do you mean?  What?  What, I mean, a little, but no, what, go on.  And if you think about it, I mean the reason he memorized all that stuff is because he thought it was important to you. You know, that\\'s the kind of guy Joey is.  That was going to be my next argument.  Hey!  Glad I could help man.  Grazie.  What\\'s going on?  Ah, the lesser-known \"I don\\'t have a dream\" speech.  Hey guys, does anybody know a good date place in the neighborhood?  OK, ahem, hey, does anybody know a good place if you\\'re not dating a puma?  Her name is Celia. She\\'s not a bug lady. She\\'s curator of insects at the museum.  Oh, I just thought we could go out to dinner, and then maybe bring her back to my place and I\\'d introduce her to my monkey.  Celia, don\\'t worry!  Don\\'t scream!  He\\'s not going to hurt you! Soothing tones, Celia. Soothing tones! Marcel...  OK.... um, a weird thing happened to me on the train this morning...  Ah....  Um... uh.... vulva.  Alright, I panicked, alright? She took me by surprise. You know, but it wasn\\'t a total loss. I mean, we ended up cuddling.  Shut up! It was nice. I just... I don\\'t think I\\'m the dirty-talking kind of guy, you know?  Joey, please.  I... ahem... I really don\\'t think so.  Yeah.  Sure.  Ahem... I want.... OK, I want to... feel your... hot, soft skin with my lips.  I, er...  I want to take my tongue... and...  ....and....  ...run it all over your body until you\\'re... trembling with... with...  Yeah!  Look, you\\'ll get there. You\\'re an amazing chef.  Oh, I was unbelievable.  I was the James Michener of dirty talk. It was the most elaborate filth you have ever heard. I mean, there were characters, plot lines, themes, a motif... at one point there were villagers.  Well, ahem... you know, by the time we\\'d finished with all the dirty talk, it was kinda late... and we were both kind of exhausted, so uh...  Yeah, which was nice.  Well, I just spoke to Carol. Ben\\'s got the chicken pox.  Yeah, so if you haven\\'t already had it, chances are you\\'re gonna get it.  You know, I might have expected this of you Phoebe, but Ryan, you\\'re a military man.  Ok, dinner\\'s on.  Alright you kids, bye now.  Oh look, a low budget puppet show.  So do you have like any nuclear weapons on board?  Wow, it, it\\'s neat learning about submarines.  Bye Ryan.  You like that do ya?  Is this what you had in mind?  I\\'m shipping out tomorrow.  And officiating at tonight\\'s blackout, is Rabbi Tribbiani.  That\\'s my sister.  Pheebs, what about you?  Disneyland, 1989, \\'It\\'s a Small World After All.\\'  The ride broke down. So, Carol and I went behind a couple of those mechanical Dutch children... then they fixed the ride, and we were asked never to return to the Magic Kingdom.  Step back.  Well, it was the only thing to do there that didn\\'t have a line.  Come on.  Probably. But you know, I\\'ll tell you something. Passion is way overrated.  It is. Eventually, it kind of... burns out. But hopefully, what you\\'re left with is trust, and security, and... well, in the case of my ex-wife, lesbianism. So, you know, for all of those people who miss out on that passion... thing, there\\'s all that other good stuff.  But, um... I don\\'t think that\\'s going to be you.  Uh-uh. See, I see.... big passion in your future.  Mmmm.  I do.  No, no, no. I\\'m not in the zone.  I\\'m taking my time, alright? I\\'m laying the groundwork. Yeah. I mean, every day I get just a little bit closer to...  Shhhh!  See?  I\\'m going to do it.  You come out there, you\\'re a dead man.  OK, I have a question. Well, actually, it\\'s not so much a question as.. more of a general wondering... ment.  OK. Here goes. For a while now, I\\'ve been wanting to, um....  Yes, yes, that\\'s right...  Why don\\'t we just put \\'poor little Tooty\\' out in the hall?  No, I mean tonight, in the building. Suddenly. Into our lives.  Wha-What did he say that was so funny?  That\\'s... that\\'s classic.  Paolo. Hi.  Listen. Um, listen. Something you should... know... um, Rachel and I... we\\'re kind of a thing.  Thing, yes. Thing.  No, no, no. Technically the... sex is not... being had, but that\\'s... see, that\\'s not the point. See, um, the point is that... Rachel and I should be, er, together. You know, and if you get in the.... um...  No, no, that\\'s not where I was going. Er, if you get in the... way, of us becoming a thing, then I would be, well, very sad.  Yeah! Se vice?  So you do know a little English.  Do you know the word crapweasel?  That\\'s funny, because you know, you are a huge crapweasel!  Thank you.  Kinda... spooky without any lights.  OK, guys, guys? I have the definitive one. Mwwwooooo-hah-hah...  Oh.. oh... oh.  Hey, y’know what’s weird? After you guys get married, when you introduce me to people you’re gonna have to say, \"This is my brother-in-law Ross.\" Not, \"My friend Ross,\" \"brother-in-law Ross.\" That’s weird isn’t it?  Yeah?  Oh, it looks like mom and dad’s house. Oh, it even has a tree with a broken limb out front and the uh, the window in the attic is…Oh my God!!  I can’t believe they-they didn’t even tell us!  I can’t believe we have to say goodbye to the house we grew up in. Man, some-some stranger’s gonna be living in my room.  They kept your room for a while.  Come on, you know they love you.  I was their first born! They thought she was barren! It’s not my fault.  Hey.  What’s wrong with this year?  Hey, y’know if you want to pick up some extra cash? Some friends of mine made good money doing telemarketing.  What?  Dad?  Dad, we-we can’t believe you’re selling the house.  Yeah, not as much as you used to love to play uncooked batter eater.  It’s a clown kit! Clown kit!  What?  How are you ever going to sell this place?  No!  Dad that won’t matter to her. Look, all my stuff is safe and dry and all her is-is, is growing new stuff! See, this is exactly the kind of thing that makes her think you guys love me more than you love her.  Well, can you blame her?  Dad, dad I don’t want to hear about it.  Well, not right now. Okay look, Monica came here for some memories and damnit, we’re gonna give her some! Okay, grab…grab some empty boxes. Okay? We’ll-we’ll take stuff from mine and whatever we can pass off as hers we’ll-we’ll put ‘em in their.  Sure! Ooh-ooh, what about this?  Hey.  Yeah. Yeah, oh you loved that thing. You always had it with you. You never went anywhere without-without that coloring book.  Oh, I don’t know how that got in there.  Umm, your boxes are umm…  Dad?  All right. I think it was a mouse.  Well w-w-w-w-wait, w-wait, wait, wait a minute! I mean a couple of stupid boxes get wet and she gets a Porsche?!  Well, what about me?! I’m a medical marvel!!  Hey you guys!  Ooh, somebody\\'s getting a little fussy.  Yeah.  Eh, I mean, I mena she\\'s not unattractive but hot? I ....  Yeah, obvious beauty\\'s the worst. You know, when it\\'s right there in your face. Me, I like to have to work to find someone attractive. Makes me feel like I earned it.  Ok, I\\'ll be home right after work. Ok, by Emma-Wemma-Demma, I love you - wovyou dovyou ...  Come on, there are plenty of other women out thereok? Just - just forget about her, ok? Just, she\\'s off limits.  What are you, a child?  Joey, come on now, for me! Please, just-just try to focus your sexual energy on someone else.  Whazzup??  Listen, can you do me a favor? I\\'m gonna be out today. Can you just keep an eye on Joey, make sure nothing happens between him and Molly?  Wh - No. Some woman who sounded a lot like Joey called earlier and asked for her daughter, the \"hot nanny\".  You do appear right on the cusp of something. Come on man, I\\'m sure he\\'ll lose interest in a week or two, but for now can you please just do this for me?  I am, yes.  Where the hell are Joey and Molly? I asked you to watch them.  We have to stop them before something happens!  Molly, ah, do you mind giving us just a minute?  Thanx.  What do you think you\\'re gonna do, have sex with her right here on my couch?  Yeah, come on in. Molly?  Well, they\\'re not mine!  Why are they here?  Someone at work ate my sandwich!  My Thanksgiving leftover sandwich. I can\\'t believe someone ate it!  Just a sandwich? Look, I am 30 years old, I\\'m about to be divorced twice and I just got evicted! That sandwich was the only good thing going on in my life! Someone ate the only good thing going on in my life!  Really?! So what would you say Pheebs? Stuff like uh, \"Keep your mitts off my grub?\"  Phoebe! You\\'re note, amazing! Not only did no one touch my sandwich, but people at work are actually afraid of me. Yeah, a guy called me mental! Mental Geller, yeah, I always wanted a cool nickname like that.  Yeah, of course, Donald.  What?!  Oh no, you-you don\\'t understand. Ugh, this is so silly. Umm, this is all because of a sandwich.  Yeah. You see my-my sister makes these amazing turkey sandwiches. Her secret is, she puts a, an extra slice of gravy soaked bread in the middle; I call it the Moist Maker. Anyway, I-I put my sandwich in the fridge over here…  What?  You ate my sandwich?  Do you perhaps seeing a note on top of it?  I\\'m fine! I saw a psychiatrist at work today.  On account of my rage.  He gave me a pill for it.  Uh-huh. Well, when the psychiatrist told me I had to take a leave of absence because I yelled at my boss I started to get worked up again, so he offered me a tranquilizer. And I thought was a good idea so, I took it.  I don\\'t know. It\\'s going to be weird not having a job for a while, but I, I definitely don\\'t care about my sandwich.  Yeah, what\\'s going on?  You slept with my sister?  My God Monica!!  Unbelievable! I mean you really kept Joey\\'s underwear?! Why? Why would you do that?!  Oh, where are you guys going?  Ah. Joey you’re-you’re having lunch with my mom?  Well this uh, this may be a little awkward.  No, its…Its not that. Umm, now what I’m going to say to you, I’m not saying as your friend. Okay? I’m-I’m saying as it as Monica’s older brother.  Not for the next few minutes.  Nope.  No problem.  Yeah.  Oh, taking my parents back to the hotel.  What? Are you going back to work?  Nice shades.  And if I remember correctly, Ray Ban was the official sponsor of World War I!  Hey, where’s Chandler?  Hey!  Is uh, is Monica here?  He left that.  I think it means he freaked out and left!  Look—Okay, I’m just gonna—I’m gonna have to go find him and bring him back! Okay? You-you make sure Monica does not find out, okay?  Gunther have you uh, have you seen Chandler?  Oh damn!  Yes. Yes. Don’t worry. Everything’s fine. We’ll uh, we’ll see you tomorrow at the wedding.  Why?!  What? Your-your list?  Yes! No-no! I know, I know what the list is! Mom! Look if you see Chandler, could you just let him know I’m looking for him?  No! I talked to Joey on the set, he hasn’t heard from him. I-I-I talked to Chandler’s parents again!  No! I made it seem like I was just calling to chat. Pretty sure, they both think I’m interested in them.  No! Hey! Hey! We can’t!  Well, can’t you at least stall her a little? I’ll-I’ll go back to some of the places I went last night.  Well how much time before she absolutely has to start getting ready?  Give me two.  Okay, wish me luck.  Why?!  We are never gonna find him! He’s one guy in a huge city!  That is an old, Chinese woman!  Aw, y’know…Y’know, maybe we’re-we’re just approaching this all wrong. If you’re Chandler and-and you wanna hide, where is the last place on Earth people would think you’d go?  So this is your office?  She’s fine. She doesn’t know you’re gone. And she doesn’t have to know, okay? Now come on, we’re going home.  What’s wrong with being the Bings?  Chandler, have you ever put on a black cocktail dress and asked me up to your hotel room?  Then you are neither of your parents!  Y’know, okay. You’re right. It is huge. So why don’t we take it just a little bit at a time? Okay? Umm, forget getting married for a sec; just forget about it. Can you just come home and take a shower?  There you go. You put on a tuxedo! Now that wasn’t so scary, was it?  I’m telling you, just a little bit at a time.  Yeah.  Wh—Hey—Whoa-whoa, where, where you going?!  Okay.  He-he was with me umm, we’re playing a little game, y’know? Hide and seek.  Oh my God! Monica!  Great. He’s doing great. Don’t you worry about Chandler.  Uh-huh.  These-these are beads of joy.  Uh Phoebe, can I see you for a second?  Chandler’s gone again!  You’re not getting away this time mister! Unless you want that ass kicking we talked about!  Then where the hell have you been?!  What?  What?! What?! Talking about what?!  Know what—If somebody doesn’t tell me what’s going on right now…  Oh my God. Oh my God! And you’re-you’re…you’re not freaking out?  Huh. This is nice.  I’ve never walked down the aisle knowing it can’t end in divorce.  Rings?  No, they\\'re not.  You\\'re wrong.  You\\'re wrong.  Will you make the mashed potatoes with the lumps?  Well, I\\'m off to Carol\\'s.  Hi, is uh, is Carol here?  Oh, I uh, just came by to pick up my skull. Well, not mine, but...Susan: Come in.  Thanks. Yeah, Carol borrowed it for a class, and I have to get it back to the museum.  Kinda like a big face without skin.  The uh, the baby that hasn\\'t been born yet? Wouldn\\'t that mean you\\'re... crazy?  You\\'re not serious, I mean, you really... you really talk to it?  Do you uh, do you talk about me?  Really?  Look, if she\\'s talking to it, I just think that I should get some belly time too. Not that I believe any of this.  Oh, I hate this story.  I don\\'t know. It\\'s just not the same without Mom in the kitchen.  That\\'s closer.  Ok, I\\'m off to talk to my unborn child.  Ok, Mom never hit.  Ok, ok, ok, ok, here goes. You know, I, you know, can\\'t do this. Uh, this is too weird. I feel stupid.  And everyone\\'s telling me, you gotta pick a major, you gotta pick a major. So, on a dare, I picked paleontology. And you have no idea what I\\'m saying, because, let\\'s face it, you\\'re a fetus. You\\'re just happy you don\\'t have gills anymore.  Oh, please. I am not singing to your stomach, ok?  Does it always, uh--?  Here we come, walkin\\' down the—this doesn\\'t smell like Mom\\'s.  I don\\'t even wanna know about the dark cheese.  And hey, here\\'s to a lousy Christmas.  Hey!  Uhh, it was okay. Yeah, it was fun.  I guess so.  No. No. Nothing happened. I shut the drapes to uh, show her slides of my favorite fossils.  Something could’ve happened. All right? She-she really dug my slides. And-and she was definitely giving me the vibe.  Anyway, if she, if she wasn’t in to me, why-why would she ask me out again?  Yeah-uh-huh. Tomorrow night, Valentine’s Day, the most romantic day of the year. Who knows what could happen? I might not be shutting my drapes to show her my slides, if you know what I mean.  I mean after tomorrow night.  Okay! Okay! Ooh-hey-hey-hey! Okay! Okay! Okay! I’ll-I’ll tell her tonight I can’t see her anymore.  You want me to call her right now?  Well umm, oh! I might be teaching another class this semester!  Hey! Uh, Phoebe’s not here is she?  Yeah! Good for you Joe!  Okay, umm…  What?  Wow! Really?!  Well, I’d love to! Here, you wait right here and I’ll go get the projector and my notes!  Ohh!  Slides are almost ready.  Uh okay, well there’s-there’s wine in the kitchen.  O-okay, Rach calm-calm down, okay? She-she’s really upset we’re just talking.  So that’s the only reason she could be here huh? It couldn’t have anything to do with the fact that-that maybe I’m a good listener and I uh I put on a great slide show!  Umm, she kissed me.  Look, I uh, I tried not to kiss her, okay?  Let me finish, okay? She started kissing me and-and I didn’t stop it. I guess I-I just wasn’t thinking…  Oh wait—hold it! But then I started thinking and I stopped the kissing.  Look I-I realize if anything were to happen with me and Jill then nothing could ever happen with us!  No, I mean, look I don’t know if anything is going to happen with us, again. Ever. But I don’t want to know that it-it never could. So I stopped it and she got mad and broke my projector.  You take care Jill.  Where\\'d you get fruit at four in the morning?  Aww, is it broken?  Mon?  Wait a minute, look.  Look, look, look.  It\\'s an empty apartment.  We\\'re all alone in an empty apartment.  There it is.  Hey.  Whoa, whoa, whoa. You looked at her. You never look. You just answer, it\\'s just a reflex. Do I look fat? Nooo! Is she prettier than I am? Noo! Does size matter?  And it works both ways.  Okay, for instance. Let\\'s say, Janice is coming back from a trip and she gives you two options. Option number 1 she\\'ll take a cab home from the airport. Option 2 is you can meet her at baggage claim. Which do you do?  Oh.  Uh, yeah, yeah I\\'ll, I\\'m right behind you.  Bye sweetie.  I\\'m gonna use the cushion.  Yep.  Shoot.  Oh my God, you\\'ve got a crush on your sister\\'s stalker.  What are you talking about?  What?  Well, aren\\'t you forgetin\\' something? What, what, what is uh, what is that guy\\'s name? Dad!  Look, you can\\'t do this Mon. All right, if you do this, I\\'m, I\\'m gonna, I\\'m, I\\'m gonna.....  I\\'m gonna tell Mom.  Crazy.  How\\'s the maniac?  You\\'re taking the word of a guy who has night vision goggles?  Oh, I’m actually on my way to tell her right now. Yeah, she’s been away all week visiting her parents, but she’ll be cool. I mean, she’s been so supportive. She-she even got the baby a tiny T-shirt that says, ‘Fossils are my friends.’  Uh, I’m going to take off.  What is it?  Hey, what’s behind your back?  You don’t want my opinion?  Come on, I’m your older brother, ask me!  Yeah?  I do too! I missed you!  Oh, it was good! It was good. Actually, the baby started kicking!  Yeah! I know! It was. Oh… the only sad thing is I wasn’t around when it happened for the first time.  Yeah, I’m missing out on all this other stuff, too. So, Joey suggested Rachel move in with me.  What?  I don’t know, she seemed to think it was such a crazy idea! Um, plus, she, uh, she got me taffy!  Ever?!  Oh, no, no, no, I will! I just want to butter her up, first! You know, I’m going to take her to an amazing Valentine’s dinner. Do all this romantic stuff, and then, just when she thinks I’m the best boyfriend in the world, then I’m going to tell her that my pregnant ex-girlfriend is living with me.  Well, I’m, uh, going to pick up Mona. What have you got going tonight?  Y’know, it’s interesting! Most people think that’s made with seawater, when in fact—  I have no idea!  Uh…lately, she just likes hanging out here.  I think she’s lonely.  I know.  No, no. She’s way to emotional. And by emotional I mean crazy.  Mm-hmm. She’s—she’s emotional, but, but ballsy.  And you thought she was going to be in our way! So, why don’t you, uh, open the champagne, and I’ll be right back. I’ve got a surprise for you.  Hey, hey, man!  Uh…Mona just dumped me.  Well, with everything that’s been going on lately, I haven’t exactly been the perfect boyfriend. You know, I, uh, I didn’t tell her I got Rachel pregnant. I gave her a key to my apartment, and then had the locks changed! And then I lied to her about Rachel moving in with me. In a way, I actually judge her for not breaking up with me sooner, you know?  Yeah. Wait a minute. What are you doing here? Joey Tribbiani without a date on Valentine’s Day? What’s going on, huh? Girl trouble?  Really?!  Oh, sorry. Well, look, maybe I can help you with it.  Hey, whatever it is, I am sure it has happened to me. Y’know, actually once—once I got dumped during sex.  Anyway, so, uh, so what is it?  C’mon! Joey! What is it?  Hey, hey, it’s me. Why can’t you tell me?  She’s not a Tribbiani?  I knew it. So, is she someone from work?  Well, uh, does she like you?  Why not?  So, uh, this guy, she used to go out with, is, uh… is he still in love with her?  Okay. Um… is he a good guy?  Then talk to him! He might be fine with it.  Joey, it’s worth finding out. I mean, if you really like her.  Okay, Joey, you know what? You have to go for it. How often does this happen to you, huh? You owe it to yourself.  I’m going to…uh…I’m going to, um, put the bourbon in it at home.  So if you take this job you\\'ll be moving to Paris?  Okay.  All right, we\\'ll work it out.  Well, Rachel moving to another country? Not being able to see her every day. How can I be okay with this?  Do you think if the Ralph Lauren people offered her her old job back, she would take it?  I don\\'t know. I could talk to her boss. Yeah! I met him at that Christmas party. We really hit it off.  I didn\\'t say we were brothers.  Yeah, I\\'m a friend of Rachel Green\\'s. Uhm, actually we met at the Christmas party about two years ago.  Uhm, well... I\\'m here to see if you\\'ll give Rachel her job back.  Oh, no. At first I have to get you to agree. Then we\\'ll see if she wants to come back.  Look, she loved her job here. And let\\'s face it: you\\'re not gonna find anyone who did it as well as she did it. Isn\\'t that true?  Oh, nothing, it’s just, it’s close to Ron. Does he.. Does little Ross like dinosaurs by any chance?  You let Rachel come back, and it’s done.  Yeah! Yes! Thank you! This is great. Thank you so much. And I swear, your kid is going to have the time of his life.  He’ll be fine.  Hi.  Emma left her stuffed t-rex at my house. You know she can’t sleep without it.  Ok.  Nooo!  So, you’re not going to Paris.  Wh… wh…what?  Huh? So? We have a deal?  Yes! yes!  Hey!  What?  They did?  So, what are you gonna do?  That\\'s great! So you\\'re staying in New York!  You\\'re excited, right?  Right!  Uhm, I hadn\\'t no you... I had no idea you were so excited about Paris. Uhm, I mean, you said you were scared.  It\\'s what you want. You should go.  I really do.  Yeah...  Guys? There\\'s a somebody I\\'d like you to meet.  \\'That\\' would be Marcel. You wanna say hi?  My friend Bethel rescued him from some lab.  Yeah. I mean, it\\'s been kinda quiet since Carol left, so...  How could you not get it? You were Santa last year.  Just a smidge.  C\\'mon, this was a pact! This was your pact!  Okay, look, he\\'s not gonna hurt them, right?  I didn\\'t wanna leave him alone. Alright? We- we had our first fight this morning. I think it has to do with my working late. I said some things that I didn\\'t mean, and he- he threw some faeces...  Oh, that\\'d be great! Okay, but if you do, make sure it seems like you\\'re there to see him, okay, and you\\'re not like doing it as a favour to me.  So tell me something. What does the phrase \\'no date pact\\' mean to you?  Okay, so on our no-date evening, three of you now have dates.  Four.  Okay, so I\\'m gonna be the only one standing there alone when the ball drops?  Hey, y\\'know, this is so not what I needed right now.  Oh, it\\'s-it\\'s Marcel. He keeps shutting me out, y\\'know? He\\'s walking around all the time dragging his hands...  Really.  What, uh... what juggling thing?  No.  Par-tay!  \\'That thing\\'? This is how you greet guests at a party? Let me ask you something, if I showed up here with my new girlfriend, she wouldn\\'t be welcome in your home?  Okay. He was more embarrassed about that than anyone. Okay? And for him to have the courage to walk back in here like nothing happened...  Perfect. Perfect. So now everybody\\'s getting kissed but me.  Should we all expect Christmas gifts that can be stolen from your office?  Hey-hey, I thought she told you to follow the recipe exactly!  So listen ah, I picked Monica for secret Santa, but I’m already getting her something for Chanukah, I was wondering if you wanna switch.  Really?! Wow! That’s-that’s so nice, what are you gonna get me?  Yeah, well maybe Phoebe will switch with me.  Oh, that’s not true! I’ve got her lots of stuff she never took back.  Like uh, that gold necklace I got her last year.  Well, she wore it all Christmas day, and then uh…  What are you doing?  Everything? Even the TV?  Listen, Joey, I know what he did was wrong but don’t you think you could at least hear the guy out?  That’s a good point. So uh, how long are you gonna punish him?  You’ve sentenced him?!  Joey, the guy’s your best friend.  Oh, who? Me?  Wow! I’m honored! And y’know what I’m gonna do as my first act as your best friend?  I’m gonna get you to talk to Chandler.  He’s coming here for Thanksgiving!  Yeah.  Hey, y\\'know, Mon, if things wrong out between you and Richard’s son, you’d be able to tell your kids, that you slept with their grandfather.  I just wanna check something.  Oh my God! You actually exchanged it!  What did you get?  Hey.  Like ‘em, like ‘em? Or, I’d like to get store credit for that amount like ‘em?  Sure! Oh, and Joey’s got the mashed potatoes if you want to exchange them.  There’s nothing the matter with me. See, I’m not completely devoid of sentiment, see I have feelings.  He’s taking her purse!  Hi!  Oh great! Hey-hey Joey, do you want to check out pictures of me and Mona ice skating?  Hey where-where are the pictures that creepy pretzel vendor took of us together?  Wow! That is a good one! Wow, it looks like a, like a holiday card y’know, with the tree in the middle and the skaters and the snow.  Uh sure, sure.  I know. Can you believe that?  Married couples send out cards, families send out cards, people who have been dating for a couple of months do not send out cards! What-what is she crazy?!  Hey!  Huh. Wow, this is great.  Well, we-we haven’t said that to each other yet, but I guess its okay to say it to other people.  A hundred?! Well, I-I guess I’ll take a—Mona, uh…I-I’m not sure about the whole uh, card thing.  Sending out a holiday card, together, I mean I just don’t know if we’re really quite there yet.  Yeah.  Huh.  Hmm…  Let’s do the card!  The card! I think we’re there!  Really?! I mean, even with the card?  Oh yeah, yeah we’re moving forward. You’ll be getting our card!  Yeah, we’re not just doing a card! Y’know, she-she also wants to have the conversation about where the relationship is going.  I know! I know! Why do you guys need to have this conversation?! Huh? I mean no self-respecting man would ask a woman, \"So, where is this going?\"  Hey! You were a closed book! Okay? I’m not a mind reader! Besides, I hate those conversations. I’m horrible at them. Really! Maybe-maybe I need kind of a gesture. Y’know, something that says we’re moving forward without having to talk about it.  Smaller than that.  Uh, bigger than that.  Whoa-hello! We were closer with the mixed tape.  Yeah I-I don’t-I don’t think I’m quite there yet, but I could say I looove spending time with you.  Forget it. I-I—Y’know what? I’ll just have the conversation. I’ll just say I like things the way they are, and hope for the best. What do you think Rach?  Here we go. Mona umm, I think it’s time we-we had a conversation about-about where things are with us.  Well, well to sum up, we’re having fun, you look young.  Really.  Not just a key, I gave her the only key! I am now a homeless person in a very serious relationship.  Oh great, I live on the street.  Okay, and oh I’m gonna need a bunch of extra keys. Apparently I give them away for no reason at all.  No. That guy is.  I’m trying to tell you I made you a mix tape.  I love you!  Right.  No-no, we talked about it. We don’t want to know. All we care about is that it’s happy and healthy.  And smart!  With an aptitude for science.  Really? Me too!  Huh. That’s a really pretty name for-for an industrial solvent.  Well, OK, it’s for a boy. Well, I know it’s a little out there, but…Darwin.  You’re just saying that \\'cause I said no to your name!  All right.  That sounds fair.  Veto.  Rain? Hi. Hi, my name is Rain. I have my own kiln, and my dress is made out of wheat.  Okay, how about, for a guy, Thatcher?  Fine, you go.  Huh.  Oh, veto. How about—Ooh, I like Ruth! What about Ruth?  Veto. Stewart?  Veto. Helen?  I don’t think you had an open mind about the name Ruth. I mean, come on, little Ruthie Geller, how-how cute is that?  Uh, no. No, we’re not.  No, no, we want to wait, right?  What? Rach! Come on, that’s terrible! They’re…uh…they’re babies. They’re-they’re all beautiful.  You’re looking!  I saw you!  Shame on you! Ugly baby judges you!  No, no, no, no! Don’t tell me! I don’t want to know!  Momentary lapse. Don’t-don’t you have any self-control?  Hey.  Rach, I-I can’t tell you how-how much that means to me! Ohh… Wait a minute. Wait a minute. You-you hated the name Ruth! Why-why would you change your mind? Unless, you know we’re never going to have to use it. You did see the folder. You know it’s a boy!  I don’t think so! You’re just giving me Ruth so you’ll get to name it when it’s a boy, and that’s when you’ll swoop in and name him Heath or Blaine or Sequoia.  Veto.  Not like this!  So, I uh… I called the doctor and now we both know the sex of the baby.  That’s right. The student has become the master.  Oh, come on, you know it’s a girl!  You really didn’t know?  No.  No.  Yes. I’m… I’m sorry. I’m so sorry.  I know! I know. You know what? I’m putting Ruth back on the table!  Permission to veto.  Hi guys.  Rachel and I are bringing Emma to Ralph Lauren today to introduce her to everyone. Doesn\\'t she look cute?  I think she\\'s gonna be the hit of the office, huh? She\\'s gonna be hotter than peasant blouses and A-line skirts. Can I get a blue bow?  Yeah, after you punched that one guy who got it wrong, word spread.  Good one, Rach.  Rach we have a code brown situation.  Alright, but you have to do one sometime.  What? No, that\\'s illegal. I\\'m gonna have the labor department down her so fast they won\\'t even...  What about Emma? We don\\'t have a nanny.  Absolutely. Just give me your breast and we\\'ll be on our way.  Huh?  So you have to tell Monica you don\\'t want to have a baby right now?  Yeah, and I was really hoping that I could hang out. What do you feel like doing?  I don\\'t feel like having sex. Maybe we can watch a movie or something.  Pants off Bing!  Hey.  You have a blue tie that would go with this? Emma spit up on mine.  Here\\'s an idea. You walk into a room...take a quick scan!  Yeah, see.. you took mine. Chandler, what about you?  Joey, uh- OMnipotent.  I cannot sleep in a public place.  It\\'s okay, y\\'know, you just nodded off again.  Why?  Funny, my birthday was seven months ago.  So, I\\'m guessing you had an extra ticket and couldn\\'t decide which one of you got to bring a date?  Oh my God, oh- is today the twentieth, October twentieth?  Ohhh.  What are you doing?  Alright, alright, maybe it\\'ll take my mind off it. Do you promise to buy me a big thumb finger?  You can totally, totally live on this.  Oh, by the way, great service tonight.  Peach pit.  Actually, nectarines, but basically...  No, actually I was just saying it looks like we\\'re not sitting together. But now you mention it, there was ice there that night... It was the first frost...  Get him! GET HIM! Get him! Get- YESSS! Not laughing now, are ya pal!  Pass it! Pass it!  I remember the moonlight coming through the window- and her face had the most incredible glow.  Look, it\\'s just a little more complicated...  Little louder, okay, I think there\\'s a man on the twelfth floor in a coma that didn\\'t quite hear you...  It was my first time.  Fun? Where was the fun? Tell me specifically, which part was the fun part? Where\\'s my puck?  \\'Yes\\', how about. C\\'mere. Gimme!  ...Now that was fun.  Green. To the green.  Uh, oh-oh, umm no you didn’t. I did.  Mornin’  I think, subconsciously…  Hi! We’re visiting!  It’s Ben and his Da-Da. Da-Da? Can you say Da-Da? Y’know, you might as well say it because I told your…  Can you say Da-Da? See, I’m gonna tell your mommies you said it anyway, so you might as well try…  Huh?  Nothing.  That tastes like feet!  That tastes like feet!  Excuse me, what?  Pivot! Piv-at! Piv-at!!  Oh the band’s ready! And well—I-I—we gotta do what the band says, right? I don’t care about the stinkin’ band!!  She\\'s not here yet. She\\'s not here. She\\'s having my baby and she\\'s not here.  I don\\'t know, but when I spoke to her, she said she had already passed the mucus plug.  God, I don\\'t believe this. She could be giving birth in the cab.  She\\'s not even here yet.  Susan wanted a Chunky. We\\'re having a baby, ok, a baby, you don\\'t stop for Chunkys.  Stopped for a Chunky.  Dr. Franzblau, hi.  I\\'ll get it.  I got it—I\\'m getting it!  Yeah. I\\'m paying you to stop.  Breathe.  Breathe.  Breathe.  15 more seconds, 14, 13, 12...  Who the hell is Jordie?  No-no-no. I don\\'t have a son named Jordie. We all agreed, my son\\'s name is Jamie.  What? Whoa, whoa whoa whoa, what do you mean, back to Jordie? We never landed on Jordie. We just passed by it during the whole Jessy, Cody, Dylan fiasco.  I got it.  I got it! Hey, you get to sleep with her, I get the cramps.  Why?  No, you started it.  But...  Please. This is so your fault.  Look, Carol never threw me out of a room before you came along.  You tryin\\' to be clever? A funny lady?  Oh, I\\'m threatened by you?  Yeah, Susan.  Help! Help!  No no no, believe me. No one has been waiting for this as much as I have, ok? And you know what the funny thing is? When this day is over, you get to go home with the baby, ok? Where does that leave me?  Every day is Lesbian Lover Day.  You wanna explain that?  Ok, got the vent open.  Ben, you ready? All right, gimme your foot. Ok, on three, Ben. One, two, three. Ok, That\\'s it, Ben.  Phoebs, It\\'s open! It\\'s open!  We\\'re here!  Long story, honey.  Let me see, I gotta see, I gotta see. Oh, a head. Oh, it\\'s, it\\'s huge. Carol, how are you doing this?  We got a head, we got shoulders, we got arms, we got, oh, look at the little fingers, oh, and a chest, and a stomach. It\\'s a boy, definitely a boy! All right! Ok, legs, knees, and feet. Oh, oh. He\\'s here. He\\'s a person.  Kinda like my uncle Ed, covered in Jell-o.  Oh, thanks, Pheebs!  We uh, we just cooked it up.  Hey.  The head, the head. You gotta...  No, this is pretty much it.  All right, I\\'ll see you guys later.  Hey!  Hey, when-when was it kicking? What happened?  My God, the baby’s kicking. That’s great. Although I…kinda wish I-I would’ve been there to feel the kicking for the first time y’know.  Look, I-I don’t want to miss anymore baby stuff. So…Here. Here’s my new pager number, okay? Anytime anything pregnancy related happens use it! I’ll be there! Okay? I don’t care if it’s three in the morning and all you want is ice cream.  Your page said come to the hospital, what? What was it? What happened?  Oh. Oh. Thank God, most women don’t even feel them.  Oh when you beeped me I was on line at the concession stand at the movie theater.  No I—Mona!  What? Why? What’s wrong?  No really, you tell me what’s up.  Yeah but still, I mean it should’ve been me. I’m the dad.  Hey uh, I brought you some lunch.  Well yeah!  What?! What?! Rach what?!  I made her favorite, tuna salad with pickles.  I can’t believe this! I shouldn’t be the one making her throw up!  Yeah? Not to you, because you know this stuff. I don’t know any of it and I’m the father. I wish I’d be more involved y’know.  Yeah.  No I-I-I would love to be around for you and the baby. And we-we can just try it like on a temporary basis.  So? Sure! But it-it wouldn’t be anything romantic. And I’m-I’m dating Mona—Damnit Mona! I was supposed to meet her like an hour ago! What is wrong with me?!  No! No it’s not. Joey, this is a smart idea.  Really?  Hey!  Hey uh Mon, I saw the Porsche parked out front, can I get the keys? Thought I’d take that bad boy out for a little spin.  It’s a car Monica! Not a rocket ship!  Hey!  Look Rach if-if you want to go for a ride in the Porsche I’ll be glad to take you for a quick spin around the block.  Whew! That was a brisk ride!  Only way to fly.  You’re fast and irresponsible. That adds up to a bad driver.  Did you see the look that girl just gave me? Huh? She must’ve seen me cruising in the bad boy.  No way!  Fine! Y’know what? It doesn’t matter, because, if I remember correctly, there is a comb on the floor of the bathroom.  What do you think you’re doing?!  There is no way I am letting you drive this car! So why don’t you just hand over the keys?  With you?! Yeah right!  In the death seat?!!  Okay, stay calm. Nothing is going to happen to you, you are not in that much trouble.  I was talking to myself! You’re going down!  Yeah, I’ll get right on that.  No Rach! Come on! No-no! Yeah, I’m sure we won’t get arrested for this.  Oh my God.  Dear Lord!!  Here it comes.  Well she should, it was taken ten years ago!  I can handle the stick!!  Who?  What?! What does he want?! I wasn’t doing anything!  Good evening officer.  Ah no. I don’t, but it could not have been more than sixty.  I mean you’re not gonna give me a-a ticket for driving too slow are ya?  Y’know of-officer I uh…I had the weirdest dream last night…  I know. I know.  So, uh, this guy, she used to go out with, is, uh… is he a good guy?  Then talk to him! He might be fine with it.  Joey, it’s worth finding out. I mean, if you really like her.  Um, you…you like Rachel?  Rachel?!  But R-R-Rachel-Rachel?!  It’s not a big deal? Oh, I’m sorry I just…um, I…what about all the stuff you-you just said? I mean how about, I like—you-you can’t stop thinking about her. Like how you can’t sleep?  Rachel who’s carrying my baby? Rachel?  Hey.  Oh y’know, I still—I can’t believe it. Joey and Rachel I mean it’s… It’s like you and me going out, only weirder!  Oh my God! What if, what if they get married? Then he’d be the stepfather of my child.  Sure, because women never like Joey. Y’know, I think he’s a virgin.  He’s not?  Why?  Okay. Okay, I’ll talk to him.  Hey.  No, I don’t want to hit you.  No.  Okay.  Thank you.  What?! You’re in love with her.  Umm, no.  I think you need to tell her how you feel.  No, I’m serious. You-you need to find out where she is, because if she’s not where you are, then you can start to move past this.  If she is where you are then uh…then my feeling weird about it shouldn’t stand in the way.  Yeah. Look if-if she’s gonna end up with somebody else, the truth is she couldn’t find a better guy. So…  So when do you think you’re gonna talk to her?  I’m understanding, but let’s not get carried away.  You sure?  Yeah.  Ohh.  That is so unfair!  Yeah, ever since you uh, told me that story about that bike I-I couldn’t stop thinking about it. I mean, everyone should have a-a first bike, so…  You like it?  Yeah?  Ahh.  Phoebe really likes the bike huh?  Wait a minute, she was walking the bike? Both times?  Pheebs you uh…you do know how to ride a bike don’t you?  Okay, now just remember everything I taught you and you’ll be fine. Okay? Here we go. Ready…Set…  Phoebe, you can’t get out of this! Okay? You have to learn how to ride a bike!  Well…In-in case of emergency.  Well let there—what if a man comes along and puts a gun to your head and says, \"You ride this bike or I’ll sh…I’ll shoot you.\"  Okay, Phoebe just-just get-get on the bike and—Hey! I’ll hold you up and-and push you. Okay?  No!  I swear!  All right. Feel good?  All right, try pedaling.  That’s it, your doing great.  Doing great! Yes-yes-yes! Take control! Yes!  I-I just thought you were doing so well. I…  Hey, there’s uh, some people outside, askin’ about candy.  Need some help?  I know. I know. But, can we please try it again? Huh? I mean, you were so close Phoebe!  Phoebe.  All right, y’know what? If you are not going to learn how to ride this bike then I’m sorry, I’m just gonna have to take it back.  Oh hey, don’t thank me, thank yourself. You’re the one who faced her fears and ultimately overcame them.  Hi.  Guess what? I made Emma laugh today.  But you know what, if you think about it, it actually promotes a healthy uhm... body image... because... even big butts or uhm... juicy doubles.  Please don\\'t take her away from me!  Hey!  Oh I know, isn\\'t it? Ooh... what\\'d you do to get her to laugh?  You sang Baby Got Back didn\\'t you?  She sweat, wet. got it going like a turbo \\'vette.  Yeah!  Yeah!  Hell yeah!  Shake it!  Shake it!  Rachel please! That is so inappropriate!  You\\'re really not coming back?  I can\\'t get *enough* dinosaurs!  You got me a cola drink?  Well this, this is too much, I feel like I should get you another sweater.  Ooh, hey Ben, what if the Holiday Armadillo told you all about the Festival of Lights?  Yeah!  Years and years ago there were these people called the Maccabees...  What are you doing here, Santa?  I\\'m the Holiday Armadillo, your part-Jewish friend. You sent me here to give Ben some presents. Remember?  Thank you, but, but you, you gotta leave.  Because, I\\'m finally getting him excited about Hanukkah, and, and you\\'re-you\\'re wrecking it.  I\\'m sorry Chandler, but this, this is really important to me.  Really? You\\'re not gonna return it?  Wow, it really is!  Oh my god...  What, you, you really quit your job?  Oh, hey...  Hey!  You kissed her.  Hey!  You like it?  It’s my new apothecary table!  Well why not?! She’ll-she’ll love it! It’s the real thing! I got it at Pottery Barn.  Why did you do that?  She hates Pottery Barn?!!  Uh, yeah! I still can’t believe she hates Pottery Barn!  Yeah but Pottery Barn! Y’know what I think? It’s just she-she’s weird. Y’know it’s because she’s a twin. Twins are weird.  Huh. Y’know what’s not one of a kind? A twin!  Hey!  Oh, you like it? You wanna know where I got it?  My apothecary table!!!  I got it at Pottery Barn!! Okay?!  Of course not, it smells like wine, which you spilled! And thanks for wrecking my sheet by the way.  Wow! I didn’t know that there was a Pottery Barn up here.  A little? Your place looks like page 72 of the catalogue. Oh look at that! The ornamental bird cage! Large!  She does want to.  Hey!  Y’know what would cheer you up?  I’m giving this lecture on erosion theories tomorrow night, I think you should come.  I got it. Uh, Joey, women don\\'t have Adam\\'s apples.  Not hating Yanni is not a real reason.  We\\'ll give you Janice.  Whoa, whoa, whoa. What, you don\\'t, uh, you don\\'t believe in evolution?  You don\\'t believe in evolution?  Too easy? Too...The process of every living thing on this planet evolving over millions of years from single-celled organisms, too easy?  Uh, excuse me. Evolution is not for you to buy, Phoebe. Evolution is scientific fact, like, like, like the air we breathe, like gravity.  You uh, you don\\'t believe in gravity?  How can you not believe in evolution?  Pheebs, I have studied evolution my entire adult life. Ok, I can tell you, we have collected fossils from all over the world that actually show the evolution of different species, ok? You can literally see them evolving through time.  You bet. In the U.S., China, Africa, all over.  Well, there you go.  Ok, Pheebs. See how I\\'m making these little toys move? Opposable thumbs. Without evolution, how do you explain opposable thumbs?  Please tell me you\\'re joking.  No, no, Pheebs, we can\\'t, ok, because--  Is there blood coming out of my ears?  You remember Janice, right?  Ok, Phoebe, this is it. In this briefcase I carry actual scientific facts. A briefcase of facts, if you will. Some of these fossils are over 200 million years old.  It\\'s the only possibility, Phoebe.  There might be, a teeny, tiny, possibility.  What?  You comin\\'?  I think when someone steals your credit card, they\\'ve kind of already thrown caution to the wind.  What? It\\'s, it\\'s just a phase.  Would you all relax? It\\'s not that big a deal.  What?  At the vet.  She says Marcel\\'s humping thing\\'s not a phase. Apparently he\\'s reached sexual maturity.  She says as time goes on, he\\'s gonna start getting agressive and violent.  I\\'m gonna have to give him up.  I know. I know. I mean, one day, he\\'s this little thing, and before you know it, he\\'s this little thing I can\\'t get off my leg.  No, no. The vet says unless he\\'s in a place where he has regular access to some... monkey lovin,\\' he\\'s just gonna get vicious. I\\'ve just gotta get him into a zoo.  Well, we\\'re applying to a lot of them. Naturally our first choice would be one of the bigger state zoos, y\\'know, like, uh, San Diego... right? But that might just be a pipe dream, because, y\\'know, he\\'s out of state. Uh, my vet, uh, knows someone at Miami, so that\\'s a possibility.  What?! Are you insane? This woman stole from you.

Anyway, they want me to go down to this- sonogram thing with them tomorrow.  I have no idea. No matter what I do, though, I\\'m still gonna be a father.  I- I think they\\'re great! I, I really do.

Well, we didn’t have freedom here until 1776, either so…  Cheers!  Oh, just hold on a second. I’m watching this rugby thing on ESPN. I don’t know what the big deal is. I’m man enough to play this sport.  Hey, I can handle it! All right?  That’s ‘cause-‘cause you’re mom’s dog kept-kept looking at me.  And is a hum, kinda like a scruddle?  Well, you should’ve seen the guy that she used to go out with. I mean, he’s like Joe Rugby.  Anyway, she thought the very idea of me playing rugby with him was like hilarious. So I’m gonna show her how tough I really am!  They don’t look any bigger than me!  All right.  Come on! The time we were all waiting in line for Dances With Wolves and that one guy cut in line in front of us and I just lost it?! Screamed at him! Turned all red! Red Ross!!  You’ll see.  JOEY!!!!!!  Did you see me? I was pretty good, huh? That is one fun game!  What? No! No, I’m not stopping. I’m Red Ross!  I don’t care! I am not quitting! I insist on finishing this game!  No, God no! That is no place for a woman. Those guys will grab anything.  I like that.  Huh?  All right, bad ankle, got it!  Yeah? I can use that, trick hip, no cup, okay! Okay!  But-but, Liam’s on my team.  Oh no! That-that’ll just bring me down! This was great! I mean I-I-I was great! This is a great day! Y’know what? I’m buying everyone coffee. All right? If someone would just grab my wallet, it’s in my pocket.  Oh, I kinda was, wasn’t I?  I made a man twice my size cry. I mean, I haven’t done that since I was four and I washed my dad’s Porsche with rocks.  Please! Are you kidding? I-I hurt three huge men, I gave a guy a bloody nose—I mean I-I’m not proud of it but, I really am. And it’s all because of you, wonderful, amazing you.  No, no, I’m serious. Thank you.  Just admit it Chandler, you have no backhand.  Shielding your face and shrieking like a girl... is not a backhand.  I know. I feel horrible. Okay.  Well, I’m gonna go see her. I want to bring her something, what do you think she’ll like?  So, this must be kinda neat for ya, huh? I mean, your Dad tells me that you get a couple of days off school, and you, you ah, don’t have to sell those cookies anymore.  Wow, you ah, you really like all this space stuff, huh?  I think you would have to clean a whole lot of apartments to go all the way to India.  Huh. Well, good luck to Dad. Say, how many more boxes would you have to sell in order to win?  Yeah.  Well, that makes sense.  Yeah, Sarah, anything.  Hi, I’m selling Brown Bird cookies.  Ah, well, it means that I can sell cookies, but I’m not invited to sleep-overs.  No, please, please, um, it’s for a poor little girl who wants to go to Spacecamp more than anything in the world.  All right!!  ...and these come in the shapes of your favourite Christmas characters, Santa, Rudolph, and Baby Jesus.  Wait a minute, one box! Come on, I’m trying to send a little girl to Spacecamp, I’m putting you down for five boxes. Chandler, what about you?  No, but ah, there’s coconut in the Hanukkah Menoreoes. I tell you what, I’ll put you down for eight boxes, one for each night.  Mon?  Ah, no Mon, Dad had to buy everyone of your boxes because you ate them all. But ah, y\\'know I’m sure that’s not gonna happen this time, why don’t I put you down for three of the mint treasures and just a couple of the Rudolph’s.  Oh, come on, now you know you want ‘em.  I’ll tell you what Mon, I’ll give you the first box for free.  Ah, we’re out. I sold them all.  Monica, I’m cutting you off.  Mon, look at yourself. You have cookie on your neck.  Check this out. Five hundred and seventeen boxes!  Okay, the other night I was leaving the museum just as ‘Laser Floyd’ was letting out of the planetarium, without even trying I sold 50 boxes! That’s when it occurred to me, the key to my success, ‘the munchies.’ So I ah, started hitting the NYU dorms around midnight. I am selling cookies by the case. They call me: \\'Cookie Dude!\\'  Well hey, who did these resumes for ya?  Well you sure used a large font.  Sweetie, calm down, it’s gonna be okay.  What, that wasn’t the great news?  Hey now! That was an accident, okay.  What’s a scrud?  I don’t have too. I can just look at you.  Hi there!  Um, that is because my doctor says that I have a very serious.... nuget.... diffency.  Well, I lost. Some little girl loaned her uniform to her nineteen year old sister, who went down to the U.S.S. Nimitz, and sold over 2,000 boxes.  That word was swans.  No.  ... finally...  God, you\\'re amazing... I didn\\'t even have to ask you to call me that.  Weh...*sigh*  Yeah, It\\'s just... I don\\'t think I can do this...  Hey, what are you guys doing?  Okay, uhm... Hey, you guys seen Joey anywhere?  Well, if you see him could you please tell him I\\'m looking for him?  Is everything okay?  Hey.  You know where Joey is?  Can I talk to you for a minute?  And then she told me that she and Joey had broken up, and that part of the reason was that she had feelings for me.  And you know I wanted to ask Charlie out since the day I met her.  Anyway, one thing lead to another, and... oh... before you know it, we were kissing. I mean, how angry do you think Joey is gonna be?  You know, I gotta go find him. He\\'s gotta be here someplace.  Hey!  You guys ready to go?  Dude! You\\'re not taking your Bible?  Learn about Jesus...  Hey!  Uh, no... no. I couldn\\'t find him. I\\'m just gonna talk to him on the plane.  Stop it!  You\\'re filthy!  Uh, actually I think she went to the salon.  Ye... Yeah... Yeah... You got shellfish in your head.  You\\'ve never said that in your life, have you?  I thought so.  Oh, I uh, I mean, I... dude, I spent the whole conference with Charlie.  Right, I\\'m gonna go talk to Joey. I think this is the right time. He\\'s always in a good mood after the flight attendant says \"duty free\".  Hey Rach...  Do you mind if I sit here for a sec.?  Hey!  So, I uhm... kinda need to talk to you about Charlie.  Okay, last night after you guys broke up... so sorry to hear about that, by the way... Well, Charlie and I were talking, and..., well...  Yeah, we kissed, but... nothing else... nothing else happened, okay.  What?  Are you serious?  I am speachless... I mean the fact that you would put my happiness first like that. I mean, you\\'re an incredible friend, you know that?  No, I mean it. You are so loyal man, and selfless, and generous...  You know what? I know Chandler longer, so I always think of him as my best friend, but now... I may have to rethink some stuff...  Hey, if there is ever, anything I can do for you...  Thanks!  Hi!  Ah, yeah. We had a really good talk.  Yeah!  Oh, no, it\\'s great. It\\'s great. He is... He is an amazing guy.  Well, I\\'m so excited about this.  Are you kidding? I have had some very dirty dreams about this...  Ooh hey, Emma, daddy has some presents for you okay? Okay? I want you to wait right here. Come here sweetie.  Oh, major shampoo explosion!  I\\'m sorry, I\\'m sorry. You were saying?  Oh, not another one! Oh my G... And this is moisturiser. It\\'s even harder to clean! Why? Why do bad things happen to good people?  So don\\'t, I don\\'t see why we have to go to this thing anyway, it\\'s your ex-fiancee\\'s wedding.  What\\'s she look like?  Get out!  Get away from me I said no!  Hey, there.  Are you all right?  Sweetie, it\\'s be gonna okay, all right. It\\'s a wedding, generally people focus on the bride.  I\\'m sorry. What was I supposed to do stand up and shout \\'Hey, Rachel, your butt is showing!\\'  Rach, hey look, I remember that, it wasn\\'t so bad.  Most of you don\\'t know me, I\\'m Rachel\\'s boyfriend.  Marenge,  Everybody!  Thanks? But I have plans; Elizabeth and I are going out of town.  Yeah.  Why? What?  No, no, that’s funny. But maybe it’s time to move on, let it go, y’know? Stop it! Besides, Rachel is going out with Elizabeth’s father, so ah, he’s much older than she is. Looks like I’m not the only one interested in fossils, huh?  Oh, come on you guys; that’s funny! Y’know? Because he’s need—he’s got like a hearing aide y’know, ‘cause-‘cause y’know, ‘cause he’s all old, and…  Really? That okay, that’s great.  All right look, I-I realize it upsets you.  But, Elizabeth and I are-are both adults and so I don’t think there’s really anything you can do about it.  Ohh! A man with a plan!  This place is really beautiful!  Wow! The only thing I got from my Grandmother was her eyes. I mean not-not her actual eyeballs, but, but people say that my eyes—Do-do you want to make out?  Ehh, I was just, I was just thinking about your father.  No. No-no uh, he just, he just really freaked me out before.  Yeah.  Oh no! Hey-hey, I’m the guy! I’ll get it.  No.  A little bit.  Okay.  Ohh, okay.  What are you doing here?!  Yeah, I recognize the ankles!  Okay, please-please Paul, just let me explain…  That’s right, I love you! And-and I’m gonna play with you all the time.  Bye.  Yeah. Why?  Yeah I know; he’s in Ben’s class.  What are you reading? The Kidnappers Guide to Manhattan Private Schools?  Uh, I actually haven’t even met him.  Well actually, I’m picking Ben up tomorrow, maybe he’ll be there.  Hey I uh just picked up Ben from school…  Well it turns out that Ben and Sting’s son do not get along.  Apparently, Sting’s son made fun of the fact that Ben’s moms are lesbinims.  Phoebe, you can’t force kids to be friends.  Playpen?! Ben’s seven!  Look I’m sorry Pheebs, I can’t do it.  What?  Look Phoebe, I’m sorry it’s just…  Phoebe, I…  Uh, middle balcony.  Yeah.  Yeah, it\\'s, it\\'s, it\\'s cute. Why, why, why does he have it, again?  You know what it\\'s fine. If you\\'re okay with the Barbi thing, so am I.  And that\\'s bad because..., you hate chicken piccata?  You didn\\'t want to share your tomatoes, tomatoes are very important to you.  Look Ben, it\\'s a toy that protects U.S. oil interests overseas!  Hey, I don\\'t know what to tell you guys that\\'s the doll he chose.  Look, G. I. Joe\\'s in, Barbi\\'s out. And if you guys can\\'t deal with it, that\\'s your \\'too bad.\\'  What?  What are you talking about?  Okay, you are totally making this up.  Okay.  Hey! I just got uh, my teacher evaluations! Check out what this one student wrote, \"I loved Dr. Geller’s class. Mind blowing lectures! Dr. Geller, you are definitely the hottie of the paleontology department!\"  Oh, I wish I knew, but the evaluations are all anonymous.  Yeah.  It’s a girl! Anyway, it wou—it wouldn’t matter. Okay? Because I’m a teacher and she’s a student.  No, but it is frowned upon.  Besides, there’s a big age difference.  I know when I’m 90 she’ll be like 80 and it won’t seem like such a big difference.  That was you?  Oh I, I don’t-I don’t think that would be the best idea.  What time?  Oh! So-so seriously, what time?  What? Of course I did! You uh, you sat next to Sleepy Sleeperson.  Oh uh, I had trouble remembering everyone’s name, so I-I kinda came up with nicknames. Like the guy on the other side of you was Smelly von Brownshirt.  Umm, no. No.  Umm, it’s Cutie McPretty.  Listen, I gotta tell ya, I-I’m having a great time! Y’know how before you said it might be weird, the whole student teacher thing, and to be frank I thought it would be too, but it’s not. I mean it’s not at all.  Well, not really. I mean technically it’s-it’s not against the rules or anything, but it is frowned upon. Especially by that professor we ran into last night, Judgey von Holierthanthou.  Yeah. What-what should I do?  Going out with who?  What do you want to do now? Huh? You wanna go get a drink?  Oh, you have some studying to do?  Nothing, I’m-I’m just, I’m so comfortable with you!  What? No! Of course, of course I do! Are-are they gone?  That’s right Lydia, Elizabeth here is a student and uh, we’re dating. And you may frown upon that, but we’re not gonna hide it anymore.  What?  Really? Its not just frowned upon?  Wow! It actually is in the handbook. I can’t date you or have a hot plate in my office. I can’t believe we have to stop seeing each other.  I know, I know I really like you too. But we-we can’t date. It’s against the rules. It’s forbidden.  What?  Really?  Well I-I-I don’t care how hot it is it’s-it’s uh, it’s wrong.  Let’s also get a hot plate!  Look I was going to tell you!  Okay, maybe it wasn’t my best decision. But I just couldn’t face another failed marriage.  Phoebe, I told her you already knew.  Okay, I got us a court date for tomorrow at 2:00 and I picked up all the forms. I’ll take care of everything.  Okay Rach, but…  Look I told you…  Look, if you’d had two failed marriages, you’d understand!  What about the time I said we were on a break?  Fine, I’m mentally unstable.  What?!  Crack isn’t even an intravenous drug!  Oh, come on!  Okay, I’m sorry, this is insane! I-I-I’m not addicted to heroin, I’m not gay, and there is no problem with my ability to consummate anything! Look, I’ll consummate this marriage right here, right now!  And when we were dating we consummated like bunnies!  Yeah!  My fault?! You threatened the judge!  That was the only way I could get him to stop typing!  I picked up the divorce papers. Uh, I’ve already signed everything and I put little ‘X’s where you need to sign.  Y’know, I-I—you’ve done a lot of stupid stuff too! Okay?  Okay, how about you flew to London to stop my wedding! Ah, how about you told me you loved me after I was already married!  Yeah! Right!  Okay, can we just sign please?  What?  Excuse me?  Yeah?  I’ve got to say; I know I divorce a lot of women, never thought I would be divorcing you.  Did I, did I even treat?  That may be the most depressing thing I’ve heard in my life. I should probably get these to my lawyer’s office.  Eh, no problem.  Wow, did not know that! May I say how lovely you look today?  Cousin Frannie’s wedding, its tomorrow night.  No.  Well l-look okay, it’s probably just a mistake. Let me call Aunt Sheryl okay? Maybe you are invited and the invitation just got lost in the mail.  Y’know, she tried to undress me too.  Phoebe he’s right, that is the rule.  Hey Joe, while you’re over there how about another beer for the Ross-A-Tron?  So I finally heard back from Aunt Sheryl and apparently it wasn’t a mistake. Ahh, there’s-there’s limited seating in the hall.  Well yeah, but she doesn’t know that. I mean, the last time she saw you-you would’ve turned one of those little wedding chairs into kindling.  Oh what’s the big deal?! I wasn’t even invited to the ceremony, just the reception. And-and y’know what? If it makes you feel any better, Joan and I will just make an appearance and then, and then we’ll-we’ll leave early as a sign of protest.  Yeah, Joan Tedeski my date. She’s an assistant professor in the Linguistics department. Tall, very beautiful, and despite what some people say, not broad backed!  What? I can’t cancel on Joan!  Bec—Did you not hear me?! She’s an assistant professor in the Linguistics department, okay? They’re wild! Why do you want to come anyway?  Oh, hey Aunt Millie.  Now wait a minute, you be nice! All right? I didn’t bring you here so you can ambush her.  So it’s really a question of who could you have possibly done.  Well…  I had a dream last night where I was playing football with my kid.  Right, but, it is just me and the baby, so I\\'m thinkin\\' they can take us. And so I uh, hah-hah, I just heave it down field.  Anyway, suddenly I\\'m down field, and I realise that I\\'m the one who\\'s supposed to catch him, right? Only I know there is no way I\\'m gonna get there in time, so I am running, and running, and that, that is when I woke up. See I, I am so not ready to be a father.  Wo-wo-whoa. What about Phoebe\\'s birthday?  Tonight.  You take your time.  What the hell are you doing? You scared the crap outta me.  Yeah, yeah. I got a lemon schmush.  Oh, we just...  Dad, before I was born, did you freak out at all?  Dad, dad, dad, I\\'m talkin\\' about the whole uh, baby thing. Did you uh, ever get this sort of... panicky, \"Oh my god I\\'m gonna be a father\" kind of a thing?  No, no, Dad, I was just wondering.  Thanks, Dad, really, I ju... you know, I just, I just needed to know, um... when did you start to feel like a father?  No, we can go to Williamsburg.  Good. Maybe he can switch it back.  Maybe not.  Well did you try calling her?  Uh-huh.  Do you have a point?  It\\'s just a fur ball.  Yours, I just got 43 points for \\'KIDNEY\\'.  I had a \\'K\\'. Where\\'s where\\'s my \\'K\\'?  You\\'ve got to help me my monkey swallowed a \\'K\\'!  No, no you don\\'t understand the animal hospital is way across town he\\'s choking I don\\'t know what else to do.  Lady, he is people. He has a name, okay? He watches Jeopardy! He he touches himself when nobody\\'s watching. Please, please have a heart!  He looks so tiny.  Yeah. The doctor got the \\'K\\' out. He also found an \\'M\\' and an \\'O\\'.  Well, the doctor says he\\'s gonna be fine, he\\'s just sleeping now.  No, why?  Hey everybody!  Hey uh, this is Elizabeth.  Bye.  Yes, her molecular epidemiology paper is due tomorrow.  Anyone else? Huh? Bring ‘em on!  I don’t know Rachel, why?  Well thanks!  Well, actually it’s been great. She’s 20 so she’s not looking for anything too serious, which is perfect for me right now.  Thanks. I know you guys like to give me a hard time and all, but it really means a lot to me that you like her. Just knowing that you guys are…  Yes, yes of course, what-what would this be regarding?  Oh-ooh!  Doorknob! Doorknob!  Oh, okay. What-what about?  Spring vacation.  You don’t understand! Elizabeth was about to ask me to go on a trip with her! Is that taking it slow?! No, I’m not ready for this! Okay? What-what do I tell her?  I can do that. Oh-oh, what if she gets upset?  What the hell are you doing?  What?! What? How do you, how do you even know its broken?!  Do not give him any money!  Yes. Yes! Please, come in.  Oo-oo!  No. I think you misunderstood what I was saying. What I meant was…  That! Let’s talk about that.  Hey!  Huh? Oh-oh, it was fine. Uh, it was just a misunderstanding. She didn’t want me to go with her. She just wanted to let me know that she’s going to Florida for spring vacation.  What’s-what’s the difference?  Hey, y’know what? Not all spring breaks are like that.  I went to Egypt with my dad.  I’m gonna call her.  Well, it turns out that she is going to Daytona for spring break woo-hoo. That means, that means wet T-shirt contests, guys doing shots off of girl’s bodies, waking up next to people you don’t even know…  Okay, she can’t go.  Then what am I supposed to do?  Well, what is she goes down and-and sleeps with a bunch of guys?  I’m so glad you’re going on this trip!  Sure. Sure. Look I don’t, I don’t know if your plans are finalized yet, but umm, hey I-I know another great way to blow off steam.  Are you into crafts at all?  To wear in front of people?  Is this?!  So uh, have a great time down there.  Yeah. And did you, did you pack that bathing suit?  It was pretty funny when I, when I hid it for a while, huh? Anyway, umm, I-I am worried about that bathing suit, not because it’s revealing which I’m fine with, no I’m concerned about your health, sun exposure.  Well, if what’s in the bottle is actually 30. I mean sometimes you get 30, sometimes it’s-it’s get 4, and I swear to God more often than not it’s just milk.  Really?  Okay. Cool.  Call me!  I just feel like someone reached down my throat, grabbed my small intestine, pulled it out of my mouth and tied it around my neck...  Thanks.  No, no don\\'t! Stop cleansing my aura! No, just leave my aura alone, okay?  I\\'ll be fine, alright? Really, everyone. I hope she\\'ll be very happy.  No I don\\'t, to hell with her, she left me!  No!! Okay?! Why does everyone keep fixating on that? She didn\\'t know, how should I know?  I told mom and dad last night, they seemed to take it pretty well.  Sorry.  I don\\'t want to be single, okay? I just... I just- I just wanna be married again!  Hi.  You can see where he\\'d have trouble.  Paul the Wine Guy, Paul?  He finally asked you out?  A wandering?  So Rachel, what\\'re you, uh... what\\'re you up to tonight?  Okay, sure.  You guys.  I\\'m divorced!  I\\'m only 26 and I\\'m divorced!  That only took me an hour.  You know what the scariest part is? What if there\\'s only one woman for everybody, y\\'know? I mean what if you get one woman- and that\\'s it? Unfortunately in my case, there was only one woman- for her...  I honestly don\\'t know if I\\'m hungry or horny.  I assume we\\'re looking for an answer more sophisticated than \\'to get you into bed\\'.  You got a job?  The word you\\'re looking for is \\'Anyway\\'...  C\\'mon, cut. Cut, cut, cut,...  No. No, I gotta go home sometime.  Yeah.  No no no, go-  Split it?  You did! Oh.... I always figured you just thought I was Monica\\'s geeky older brother.  Oh. Listen, do you think- and try not to let my intense vulnerability become any kind of a factor here- but do you think it would be okay if I asked you out? Sometime? Maybe?  Okay... okay, maybe I will...  Goodnight.  There\\'s an image.  Question. Why do we always have to have parties where you poach things?  Question two. Why do we always have to have parties with committees?  Yeah.  I talked to Rachel\\'s sisters, neither of them can come.  Hi honey, how did it go?  Thanks for being born.  Oh, now you can exchange them if you want, ok.  Really?  All right.  What?  You know what, this is ridiculous, ok. This is your birthday, this is your party. I say we just put \\'em all together and if they can\\'t deal with it, who cares.  That\\'s who.  Ok, do you have any ideas for any openers?  Hi Dr. Greene. So, uh, how\\'s everything in the uh, vascular surgery....game?  I\\'m sorry. See that\\'s the good thing about my job. All the dinosaurs on my table are already dead.  Oh, here, I, I\\'ll get it for ya. Whad\\'ya want?  Scotch. Alright, I\\'ll be back in 10 seconds with your scotch on the rocks in a glass.  Cool.  I know.  Hi. Uh, I have been in the bathroom. Stay clear of the salmon mousse.  No. no.  No, um, see \\'cause that, that is, that is the staging area. If you go in there, it\\'ll ruin the whole illusion of the party. Yeah, I think you take your scotch back in there and I will get your cigarettes for you sir.  Mine.  Neil Sedaka wears them.  Hey!  Oh, but I\\'ve got tickets to the Van Gogh exhibit! I\\'ve been waiting like a year for this.  What\\'d you say?  Is that supposed to be an insult?  So Rach, maybe you and I could fly out together Saturday.  Hey.  May I come in?  Do you want me too?  Oh so-so you weren\\'t trying to entice me just now with your-your nakedness?  You weren\\'t trying to entice me with your nakedness.  Can we, can we just forget this ever happened?  Thank you.  Y\\'know, last night was embarrassing for you too.  Uh-huh. But it was a first for the rest of my building.  What?! You totally get embarrassed!  Is that so?  What the? What…  Ohh, it was the best!  Hey, you wet my pants!  What?  Oooohhh, I\\'ll bet she\\'s one of those people.  What? No-no, a lurker.  Okay when you\\'re playing a machine and it hasn\\'t paid out, a lurker waits for you to give up and then…  No. They swoop in and steal your jackpot.  Uh-hmm.  My nana used to do it. That\\'s how she paid for all my dance—karate lessons.  What?!  Oh my God! Rach-Rach, are-are-are you sure?  Joey!!  Hey listen I uh, talked to Chandler, sorry about the movie.  Your what?  What?! That\\'s not gonna make you any money!  Oh, come on! Rach, it\\'s-it\\'s not that bad.  Okay, there was some staring and pointing.  Really like those Macadamia nuts, huh?  Ohh, here\\'s that Macadamia nut!  I wanna get out of the room! Y\\'know, I…I really miss downstairs.  Well hello! I\\'m Ross!  You see, and you thought she\\'d be judgemental.  Whip it out, whip it out.  Joey, what did you think a nubbin was?  You were in a porno?  So, uh, does it do anything, you know, special?  You know, you are so amazing, is there anything you, you don\\'t know?  OK sweetie, I\\'ll see you later.  Hey.  Hey?  Can I ask you somethin\\'?  Naa.  OK, what\\'s the longest you\\'ve been in the relationship before ha, have, having the sex?  Technically, huh, no.  No, no, she\\'s great and it\\'s not like we haven\\'t done anything. I mean, uh, uh, we, we do plenty of other stuff, lot\\'s of other stuff, like uhh. . .  It\\'s just, it\\'s, it\\'s me. You, you know I\\'ve only been with one woman my whole life and she turned out to be a lesbian. So now I\\'ve got myself all psyched out, you know, and it\\'s become, like this, this thing and I. . . Well, you just must think I\\'m weird.  What?  Sexy?  No kidding?  What?  You\\'d wait?  Really?  Women really want this?  Hi everyone.  Well, I was going to, but after I talked to you, I talked to Joey.  Basically he told me to get over myself and just do it, ya know. So I though about what you said and I though about what he said and, well, his way I get to have sex tonight so. . .  Pop it in.  What\\'s wrong with people having sex?  Looks to me like he\\'s the one getting the job.  Goodnight.  Oh, no no, I am.  Um, no, I uh, I have done it before.  I uh, I don\\'t know, I guess I\\'m just gonna see, see what happens.  Wha, uhh, what?  OK, now I\\'m nervous.  No, no, I don\\'t wanna put it off, I just, God I just, I spent last year being so unbelievably miserable, ya know, and now, now I\\'m actually happy. You know, I mean, really happy. I just, I just don\\'t wanna, I don\\'t wanna mess it up, ya know.  What, it\\'s not your fault.  Really?  Good morning.  Twice.  Uh yeah! Let me, let me get that for you.  Kristen, hi. Are you uh, new to the area, ‘cause if you are…I’d love to show you around sometime.  Ah.  Umm, say you’re gonna be starving after all this moving. What do you say I take you to dinner tonight?  Yeah?  Laugh all you want but uh, she actually left me a message saying she’d like to go out again.  Oh great! We’re going out again Saturday. But I just found she’s also seeing some other guy.  Well obviously only one of us can keep dating her.  Well now let’s-let’s look at this objectively, I think I should date her…  That’s interesting, but check this out. I date her…  Okay, okay. This can go on for a while.  No Joey! Look why don’t, why don’t we just let her decide? Okay? Hey-hey, we’ll each go out with her one more time. And-and we’ll see who she likes best.  Maybe I’ll take her to that new French restaurant down the street…  Well sorry, that’s what I do on dates.  So let’s decide on the spending limit…  I was thinking more like a hundred.  Hey! What’s up?  Oh thanks!  We have 8:00 reservations at Grammercy Bistero.  I am dressed.  I have an oily T-zone!  That’s right.  Uh actually, I sent the flowers before the actual date. So techincally, technically I didn’t break any rules. Thanks for stopping by though.  Oh yeah? What are you gonna do?  Why am I not surprised?  I don’t think you have much choice.  Bye-bye!  So they said our table will be ready in just a few minutes.  Yeah.  Oh yeah it’s fine. I guess the more muscles you have the more they can spasim out of control.  Yeah. So…  So Joey umm, you look familiar. Are uh, are you on TV or something?  That’s right! That’s right, don’t you play a woman?  Much better.  Well yes, yes I have. In fact umm, just the other day Kristen and I were talking about how I’ve been married and how I have a son.  That’s right! Wait no, Ben.  Well umm…  Yes. And another time after that. Boy I’m getting hungry! Hey Joey, have you ever been so hungry on a date that when a girl goes to the bathroom you eat some of her food?  Wait a minute! Were you on a poster for gonorrhea?  Hey you leave Marcel out of this!  Hey-hey have you ever locked yourself in a TV cabinet VD boy?!  Probably around gonorrhea.  Yeah, laugh all you want but in ten minutes we’re gonna have younger looking skin!  Food.  Oh my God. It\\'s like Sophie\\'s Choice.  I just can’t see Chandler cheating!  I know, and with the baby coming?  I don’t know. Phoebe, if one of us saw Mike with another woman would you want us to tell you?  We think Chandler might be having an affair.  What\\'s going on?  Oh my God.  You know what, if you wanna look for a house, that\\'s okay.  What?  You put an offer on a house?  Yeah, I mean, if you moved there, you have to leave here. I mean, how can you leave this place?  You can see where he\\'d have trouble.  That money is mine, Green!  What was Monica’s nickname when she was a field hockey goalie?  Correct. Rachel claims this is her favorite movie…  Correct. Her actual favorite movie is...  Monica categorizes her towels. How many categories are there?  Two seconds...  No, 19.  Joey had an imaginary childhood friend. His name was?  Correct, his profession was?  Correct! What is Chandler Bing’s job?  10 seconds, you need this or you lose the game.  Don’t blame the questions!  What the hell are doing?!!  And hey, here\\'s to a lousy Christmas.  Yeah. I\\'m sorry too. I\\'m even more sorry that that phone call didn\\'t come before I told you about looking through the window.  Seriously you guys, what\\'s going on? What are these for?  No thanks!  The woman just vanished!  No! Do you know what your odds are of winning the lottery? I...I mean you have a better chance of being struck by lightning 42 times.  Seriously you guys, I can\\'t believe you\\'re going to spend 250 dollars on the lottery, I mean that\\'s such a bunch of boohaki.  Oh oh, we think Emma is about to start talking so we\\'re trying to be careful about what words we use in front of her.  Yeah, uh... and then I figured after you win, we could all go out to the balcony and see a night rainbow with gremlins dancing on top of it!  Uh, you\\'re not gonna win.  Ok, I\\'ve heard myself on tape and I sound nothing like that.  Why would I eat my own arm?  Why?  I don\\'t know, probably just invest it.  Oh, I\\'ve gotten into the habit of calling Rachel \"Mommy\" when we\\'re around Emma. Which I now realize we are not ...  Although if we\\'re gonna do that, we should probably call me \"Daddy\" too.  I ... I was just talking about Rachel.  I can\\'t believe this, I thought we were all in this together!  3 minutes ago!!! I don\\'t know why that\\'s important ...  Monica!  Go, go, go!!  Weird.. your psychic didn\\'t mention anything about the scary pigeon...  Oh yeah, it\\'s a good idea!  Oh, we have one too!!  Oh yeah, no no no...that\\'s great!  Oh, Rach...oh...\"gleba\" is not a word.  Okay, what does it mean?  Yes you did, gleba is a word!  Ok, use it in a sentence.  It\\'s not a word!  Oh, oh, ok, great. You know what, while you\\'re at it she said another word the other day, why don\\'t you, why don\\'t you look up: pbbqqt....  Me too. So much for my dinosaur/Amelia Earhart theme park.  Phoebe, you don\\'t have any of the first five numbers.  I guess if everybody else is...  What happened?  Yeah, anything goes, except ah, eye gouging and fish hooking.  All right so, Chandler, from now on, don’t give your boss a chance to get you. Y\\'know just ah, don’t turn your back to him.  Yeah, it’s the Ultimate Fighting Combo. Yeah, I saved thirty cents, plus I get to keep the cup. Yay!!  Well, then that guy is in serious, serious trouble.  All right! You go get him! Let’s go!  Hey! How long until Pete’s fight?  Hot dog?  What? Oh! I gotta tell you, I-I wasn’t expecting to like her at all, I mean I actually wasn’t expecting to like anyone right now, but she’s really terrific.  No, I-I’m saying I liked her.  Pheebs, I think she’s great. Okay? We’re going out again.  Ahh, the one next to my foot. Sorry.  Well, this is ironic. Of your last two boyfriends, Richard didn’t want to have kids, and from the looks of it, now Pete can’t.  Hey Joey, how come our stuff isn’t free?  Hey does anyone have any gum?  Y’know what? I’m good! I’m good!  Hey!  When you put a ‘D’ at the end of ‘Fine’ you’re not fine.  Hi Jill.  Jill, how did you pay for all this? I thought your dad took away your credit card.  I don’t think charging new clothes too your dad qualifies as making it on your own.  Sorry-sorry Jill.  Yeah! Oh, I-I love this babies!  Ross, wants a pajmena?  Well. Hey…  Oh stop.  No, you stop!  Did you tell your sister to ask me out?  Oh wow! I mean, wow! I mean, I-I-I think she’s cute but I-I would never have thought of going out with her, never!  Yeah but after you said it was okay, I figured, \"Why not?!\"  I have to say you are a much bigger person than I am. I mean after all we’ve been through, I just—y’know I wish I had a brother to reciprocate. Hey, if you ever want to go out with Monica, you have my blessing.  Rachel! Well, you-you’re not at home, you’re-you’re-you’re right here.  What\\'re you talkin\\' about?  Yeah but Phoebs, what about the end?  Hi.  Oh you guys are not gonna believe what happened.  Ok, we were sitting over there playing on the floor and he grabs the table and he pulls himself up. He pulled himself up. Standing man. I\\'m sorry you guys missed it but I did tape it so it you guys want to see it.  I don\\'t believe this. I miss, I miss the first time of everything. I missed, what, the first time he rolled over, the first time he crawled. What else did I miss? Has he spoken yet, is he driving, does he have a favorite liquour?  Ooh, I, I\\'m so sick of missing stuff. Ya know, I want him for more than, than a day, I want him for a whole weekend. No listen , I mean, I feel like-  Really? I mean, I, I had a whole speach prepared.  Oh look, did, did you just see that? Did you see? He just waved, he just waved, he\\'s never waved before, you\\'ve never waved before. Yes he has. Very good.  Well, ya know, they\\'re a little behind the times in Colonial Williamsburg.  Buy mommy.  Have a good time. Ok, Ben.  Yeah.  Well for starters, you may want to light it and lose the spatula.  Look it\\'s the artist formerly known as Chandler.  Yeah, you really sidestepped that land mine.  Thank you.  Hi, we\\'re visitiing. It\\'s Ben and his da-da. Da-da. Can you say da-da? Look, I\\'m gonna tell your momies you said it anyway so you might as well try.  Naa. A while ago I got a sah out of him, which I thought, ya know, might turn into sah-condary caregiver but... Hey, would you uh, would you hold him for a sec, \\'cause I, I gotta take this off.  What\\'re you doing?  Yeah, well, he\\'s a baby not a bomb.  Well just hold him like you\\'d hold a football.  Ok, here, here. There we go.  It\\'s alright, it\\'s no big deal.  Yeah, definitely, I\\'m sure you\\'ll feel totally different when it\\'s our baby.  What?  Uhh, yeah. I mean, actually I kinda think that we\\'ll have, we\\'ll have two babies.  Yeah. Ya know, a boy and a girl. Hopefully the girl will come first so Ben here won\\'t feel too competitive.  Well, we won\\'t wanna raise kids in the city so we\\'ll probably move to uh, Scarsdale.  Yeah, that way I figure, ya know, we\\'ll be far enough away from our parents that we don\\'t have to see them all the time but close enough that they can come over and babysit whenever we want. And yes, I know, the taxes are a little higher than, let\\'s say, Nassau county but the school system\\'s supposedly great.  Huh?  Well I\\'m sorry, I think about stuff. Ya know, I mean, you\\'re at work, you\\'re assembling bones, your mind wanders.  C\\'mon, what, you never think about our future?  No, no, I mean, ya know, I, I read a book and there was a girl named Emily and I thought, I thought that might be good.  The big book of childrens\\' names.  Yeah.  Ok fine.  We\\'re not done.  Ok, then you\\'re gonna have to understand that you\\'re with a guy who\\'s not gonna stop planning his future with you because he knows that we\\'re gonna end up together and if that scares you, tough, \\'cause you\\'re gonna have to deal with that.  Good, \\'cause I love you.  Yeah.  Well that\\'s the first time we\\'ve said that.  Well, I\\'m gonna kiss you.  Ok, and then you take the poopie diaper and you put it in the poopie diaper pail.  Wha, what?  What, the word hi?  Great, great, and I miss that too, I miss everything.  Something about hi.  Well, this was fun. Uh, we should really do it again sometime, wha\\'dya say? Ok. Alright so I\\'ve got him.  Tuesday right. Ok, bye you guys.  Bye Ben.  Alright, alright, ok. Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Hey, what’s going on?  I found a note on my door, \"Come to Monica’s quick, bring champagne and a Three Musketeers bar.\"  What’s up?  Where is she?  Oh, I thought it was just a kid yelling, \"I’m gay! I’m gay!\" Can I bring her in?  Hey!  Wow! Happy Monica’s night!  Thanks.  Well sure. But I get married all the time so…  You okay?  You mean, we—you and me?  Oh good, you scared me for a minute.  Surely you can think of something good.  What?  Yeah? I was good at the stuff huh?  My hands?  Yeah?  A what?  One night, just-just sex. No strings attached?  No.  Okay, this is getting a little crazy. I mean, I’m-I’m sure it would be amazing but I…gotta say I really-really don’t think it would be a good idea. Y’know? I really, really…don’t.  Okay, Monica. Mon, uh what-what you just saw…  It is! It is!  Okay! Ho-ho! We did not steal your thunder because we are not getting back together!  Yeah!  Look let’s not make a big deal out of this! It was a one time thing. It doesn’t even matter!  Oh no!  Hey, I just realized we kinda let some stuff up in the air…  Still thinking about it huh?  Uh, Rachel, I’ve been thinking. I don’t think us getting together tonight is such a good idea. I’m calling it off.  Look uh, if we’re gonna do this…  Oh, I see, so everybody wins.  Oww!  I Ross...  I, Ross…  Happy too.  Yay!  Okay.  Hi!  Oh no! It could be better, but it’s gonna be okay, right?  No! No! Of course it didn’t mean anything! I mean, uh well, I can understand why Emily would think it meant something, y’know, because-because it was you…  Look, I’m sorry.  Oh, right!  No, I’ve looked everywhere!  Actually, do you guys mind staying here for a while?  Wait, well wh-wh-wh-where is she?  Rach! Rach!  Hi! What are you, what are you doing here?  Oh.  Not yet.  Pretty soon I guess.  I just, I don’t understand, I mean, how-how can she do this? Y’know, what, am I, am I like a complete idiot for thinking that she’d actually show up?  Same difference.  I get it! Well, that’s that.  What?  Oh, I don’t, I don’t, I don’t know…  I could, yeah, I can do that.  I can’t, I can’t even believe her! No, y’know what, I am, I am gonna go!  I know, why not?  Right?  Yeah, well…nah.  Why don’t you come, I mean, I-I have two tickets, why not?  Yeah, yeah, it’ll be great! You can, you can lay on the beach and I can cry over my failed marriage. See-see how I make jokes?  No really, I mean, I mean, God, I could use a friend.  Okay!  Cool!  Ah! Ah! I forgot my jacket!  You tell them to wait!  Emily.  Yeah! Yeah! OK! Sure! Look! Can we...can we talk about what happened here last night?  OK you...you really don\\'t know what I am talking about?  OK! Last night after the party I saw Rachel kissing that jerk from her office out on your balcony.  Right that\\'s why I came over to talk about. Hum...I saw Rachel kissing some guy on your balcony,  Why...Why should I? I mean if she wants to move on, that\\'s fine!  No I\\'m serious. I mean she wants to date people? Fine! I don\\'t care but...at least she could have told me. You know  I don\\'t know. I mean I have plenty of opportunity. Just just now there were some women at the coffee house smiled at me.  Well, and how about this? There is an anthropologist at school who totally came on to me during the inter-departmental  Not well. I went on the subway again and someone did sit on my hand but that person was neither female nor wearing pants.  That\\'s funny...Do you think you\\'ll ever work again?  I can\\'t believe Rachel just moved on and didn\\'t say anything to me  No no, about a month ago she gave her number to some guy in a bar.  No. When he called, I...I threw the message away.  You know what? Enough! Enough talking! I have to get moving! Hey check out those two blondes over there!  You don\\'t have to do anything. It will just be easier if it is the two of us, like college, remember? You...you break the  Don\\'t you have to be at work?  Hum...So...hum...Oh hey I noticed you were reading the paper...another flood in Europe? Here�s a question: \"Would you...  Hi! I could help not notice, but that\\'s an unusual necklace  Right, so that\\'s a firm \"no\". I cannot believe this, I just keep striking out.  This is great. Rachel\\'s gonna keep kissing guys until she finds the one she wants and I\\'m gonna die alone.  But, what�s great is that you don�t mind talking about it.  Uh-ah!  Oh, yeah, hello, well, now, here I am.  Oh, yeah, yeah that�s Michelle.  Oh, just this woman I�ve been seeing.  Yeah, didn�t I mention that? Yeah, I mean, we haven�t being going out for too long, but rather there is this  How great is this? You are already comfortable enough to look through my stuff. Oh, I am sorry Michelle, that�s  I told you about my daughter.  I told you it wasn�t long, but there is an amazing connection between us.  Are you kidding?  We�ll see.  I don�t know, are we just kissing guys on balconies?  Through the magic of sight! I was here, putting our child to sleep...  When I happened to look through the window and I see you kissing a guy you know, for what? A week?  Ok, Michelle, it�s time to go.  Ok.  You know, if it�s meant to be, I�ll guess it. Bye, bye.  Oh, I am sorry, did you not like her, because I was hoping that we could come to one of your kissing parties on  Oh, really!  Oh, really!  What about the guy from the bar?  The guy you gave your number to.  Because he called here looking for you. So don�t tell me this...this kissing this guy from work is a one time thing,  What?  Because I folded it up and put in my pants pocket. Do you...do you not look there?  I never gave it to you.  I don�t know.  Who am I?  I am the guy who�s taking care of our baby while you�re out at bars meeting guys!  None of the sane ones wanted to come back with me! That�s not the point. Ok? The point is you...you are the one  Uh, clearly.  Yeah, maybe not. So what you wanna do?  Yeah?  Sure. Why not?  Yeah?  Wait-wait-wait, do you, do you think, maybe we shouldn’t invite her?  Yeah sure.  Huh? Yeah, fine, invite whoever you want.  I don\\'t want to be single, okay? I just... I just- I just wanna be married again!  Hi.  You know you probably didn\\'t know this, but back in high school, I had a, um, major crush on you.  You did! Oh.... I always figured you just thought I was Monica\\'s geeky older brother.  Oh. Listen, do you think- and try not to let my intense vulnerability become any kind of a factor here—but do you think it would be okay if I asked you out? Sometime? Maybe?  Okay... okay, maybe I will...   See, I see.... big passion in your future.  I do.  Hey, I have a question. Well, actually, it\\'s not so much a question as.. more of a general wondering... ment.  Okay. Umm, for a while now, I\\'ve been wanting to, um....  Yes, yes, that\\'s right...  You were incredible! Brand new woman, ladies and gentlemen.  You had no right to tell me you ever had feelings for me.  I was doing great with Julie before I found out about you.  The point is I... I don\\'t need this right now, OK. It, it\\'s too late, I\\'m with somebody else, I\\'m happy. This ship has sailed.  Fine.  Good.  No, hey, I get that, okay, I get that big time. And I’m happy for ya, but I’m tired of having a relationship with your answering machine! Okay, I don’t know what to do anymore.  Is this about Mark?  Okay, it’s not, it’s not.

I mean, I don’t feel like I even have a girlfriend anymore, Rachel.  No, but it’d be nice if you realised, it’s just a job!  Yes.  No, hey, I get that, okay, I get that big time. And I’m happy for ya, but I’m tired of having a relationship with your answering machine! Okay, I don’t know what to do anymore.  Is this about Mark?  Okay, it’s not, it’s not.  Oh I’m, I’m making this too hard. Okay, what do you want me to do.  Oh, hi Chloe.  Yeah, little change in plans. Ahh, we’re gonna break-up instead.  What can I do? One person wants to break-up, you break-up.  Oh come on, we just had this huge fight, all right, don’t I have to wait a while?  Hi! It’s me.  Really?

Look, I don’t feel like dancing, I feel like having a drink. Okay?  Oh, no, no.  So, so, is Mike coming to dinner?  Actually, um, I was thinking maybe both of us could go.  Thanks, I put a lot of extra thoughts on your gift.  Oh, what were the other two?  I know, it�s the first time, we�re leaving the baby and � hey, I know how hard it is for you, but � but Emma is gonna be fine. My mom is gonna be with her. She�s great with kids.  Ya.  Hey, you only heard Monica�s side of that. That little fatso was a terror.  Rachel, I know that you can. And you should.  Really, it would be good for you and in fact, why don�t you, why don�t you go ahead to the restaurant and I will wait for my mom and then I�ll meet you there.  Okay, well the ??? is not home.  Oh-oh, wait, my mother is gonna be here any minute. And she has the keys.  I would, but I bruise like a peach. Besides, y�you know, everything is gonna be fine. The baby�s sleeping.  Can�t hold her own head up, but yeah jumped.  Rach you did not leave the water running. Please, just pull yourself together, okay?  Oh my god, you know what, yeah, I think you�re right. I think � listen, listen!  Great. So let�s get going?  Somehow over time it got easier to be apart from you.  I�m so sorry �  And then Rachel wasn�t sure she could leave the baby.  What?  Thanks. Oh.  Y�know this ??? is incredible.  Okay, I�ll have the fixed salad and the duck.  Rach, c�mon, Emma is fine. You�re turning into an obsessive mother. Okay, you need to stop.  Well, ??? think that�s us?  Oh, mine\\'s December...  Yeah, it\\'s-it\\'s tough being single. That\\'s why I\\'m so glad I found Amanda.  Come on, Pheebs lay off him.  Yeah, he\\'s a little sensitive right now, `cause he\\'s so in love.  Oh.  Great, actually. I\\'m thinking tonight, maybe the night. Yeah, I mean ah, the kids are gonna play together and then when they\\'re asleep, I\\'m thinking Amanda and I break open a bottle of wine, and do a little \"playing\" ourselves.  Well maybe he\\'ll get to go soon, like on a class trip or something.  Monica knows.  Hi!  Wow! You-you look great!  Oh no-no-no, it\\'s my pleasure.  What?  I-I-I...  Who wants to make some long distance calls?  Pheebs, what are you doing?  Are you serious?  At least I know she\\'s not going out with me to get into R rated movies.  You see Amanda and I have a very special...  Fine.  I have to say Tupolo Honey by Van Morrison.  Hey Mon!  Nope.  Yeah, she finally stopped crying yesterday, but then she found one of Richard\\'s cigar butts out on the terrace, so.  Getting it away from me would be job one.  You need to get some sleep.  Well I\\'m thinking that Chandler\\'s our friend and Janice makes him happy, so I say we just all be adult about it and accept her.  Hmm?  Nooo, I had to return it to the costume place.  I think I have an old band uniform from high school.  Yeah.  What?  No.  Nope.  What?  Okay, umm. Did you ever see, um, Return Of The Jedi?  Do you remember the scene with, um, Jabba the Hut? Well Jabba had as, as his prisoner, um, Princess Leia.  Princess Leia, was wearing this, um, gold bikini thing. It was pretty cool.  Look who I found standing outside of the Szechwan Dragon staring at a parking meter.  Okay.  Hi.  Guess what?  They published my paper.  How could you have told her?  Oh, she didn\\'t think it would be that big of deal.  Look, that was supposed to be like a private, personal thing between us.  That\\'s different, okay. That\\'s like, uh \\'Who dated a stripper?\\' or \\'Who did it on the back of the Staton Island Ferry?\\'.  Yeah. Look, you don\\'t, you don\\'t talk about like, you know, your girlfriend and the intimate stuff you, you do with her.  Noo!  Hmph. So what you, you tell each other everything?  Did you talk about the night of five times? Do you tell people about the night of five times?  I know, but it\\'s still worth mentioning, I think.  Women tell each other everything. Did you know that?  No Chandler, everything! Like stuff you like, stuff she likes, technique, stamina, girth....  Rachel says sharing\\'s great and supposedly, you know, we outta be doing it. Do you wanna?  Nooo!  Yeah?  Okay, okay, I\\'ll go first.  So, uh, the other night Rachel and I are in bed talking about fantasies, and I happened to describe a particular Star Wars thing....  Yes!  Yes! Wow, well, that-that was easy. Okay, you-you go.  Okay.  Hmph.  With the belly-button ring? Oh, muhawa!  Your Mom, your telling me, your telling me, about your Mom, what is the matter with you?  sure.  oh yea now um how is that going, is it getting serious?  you know I really admire your whole dating attitude, it\\'s so healthy I\\'m always like is this moving to fast? Is this moving to slow? Where\\'s this going?  but you, your so much better off you just go from guy to guy having fun and never worrying that it terns into anything serious.  I know and yet here you are all ready for the next date.  no, no, no there\\'s nothing wrong with you I mean you don\\'t strike me as the type of person that wants to get married anyway.  please don\\'t cry because of me pheebs I don\\'t know what I\\'m talking about, I\\'ve been divorced three times.  I\\'m sorry I didn\\'t catch.  Oh Ross Geller  do you have a compact in your purse?  you look great.  so how\\'d the date go?  So he hasn\\'t called?  now I feel terrible this is all my fault.  We are a rare breed.  I\\'m Ross, Phoebe\\'s friend from the coffeehouse.  yeah I really, really need to talk to you about something.  Damn super cuts!  oh no yeah, no Phoebe is great, but umm I\\'m an idiot look right before you guys went out I accidentally got her all upset.  yes, yeah I said something stupid about her never having had a serious relationship, but you should know she is so much fun, a wonderful person please don\\'t blow her off.  well then I didn\\'t need to bother you or the four other Mike Hanagens I bothered.  of course she has. if she\\'d never had a serious relationship I\\'d go round broadcasting it like some unstoppable moron.  yes, yes I did. and I will also say what I\\'m about to say Vis-�-vis the following Phoebe has never had a serious relationship since her. super-serious relationship with. Vicrum.  WHAT THAT\\'S A REAL NAME!  Hey!  oh boy you got mad at that part. I went over there to tell him how great you are but you know me BLAH, BLAH, BLAH, and I ended up telling him that.  umm. that you had a six year long relationship with a guy named Vicrum.  well he seemed to bum hard that you\\'d never been in a serious relationship.  Good yeah just be honest with him.  I\\'ll get it  Sure. Yeah.  Uh, yeah, you sure you want to after what happened at their 20th?  Okay, hopefully this time mom won’t boo you.  Hey!  Aww that is so cool.  You were the 200-pound 11-year-old who rode her!  Ah, actually, I’m sorry we-we probably should get going.  Well, there is an Arby’s in the shape of a tee-pee.  So uh, he seems like a nice guy.  Ya wanna hang back and take our own cab?  That’s a good question, dad. That’s a good question…  Wha—What?  Dad so what we have to pretend that we’re married?  Can you believe that?  No, us having to lie about being married.  Hi Aunt Lisa, Uncle Dan  We love marriage!  Hey  I’m so we weren’t in the car! Did he ever let up?  That depends, how much did you hear?  What was wrong with Mona?  Yeah baby!  No, no, it was just our parents and 1 or 2 friends. It was a small wedding.  Okay, okay. Ooooh, ooh maybe I rode in on a Harley.  Well, um, actually, I-I took her to the planetarium. That’s-that’s where we had our first date. Um, she walked in and I had the room filled with lilies, her favorite flower…  Then, Fred Astaire singing The Way You Look Tonight came on the sound system, and the lights came down. And I got down on one knee and written across the dome in the stars were the words \"Will you marry me?\"  Oh, no, Mom, it’s just Monica this year.  …and then, we could’ve gone from the ceremony to the reception with you in the sidecar!  But having a dove place the ring on your finger would’ve been no problem?  Yeah! And! And, it was the easiest 400 bucks I’ve ever made.  Yeah.  I know, I know it was stupid.  No, actually I thought about it when, when we were going out. It’s how I imagined I uh, I would ask you to marry me.  Even if the sidecar had a windscreen so your hair wouldn’t get messed up?  That’s all I’m askin’  Y’know I don’t understand why they didn’t cry. It was a beautiful speech.  Hey! All that stuff you said about true love, you were right, I mean, we did learn a lot from Mom and Dad! And that picture of Chi-Chi with her mischievous grin. And what you said about Nana. Ohh, yeah she really would’ve wanted to be there. And you know what? I think she was.  Is Rachel here? I gotta talk to her.  Damn!  I told Emily to come. And I just need to y\\'know, talk to Rachel about it.  I have no idea. I mean… But-but I assure you I will figure it out.  So, Rach, y\\'know-y\\'know how Emily\\'s coming right?  Anyway it-it kinda-it all boils down to this, the last time I talked to Emily…  What?!  Le Poo\\'s still alive?!  Hey, so uh, y\\'know how there\\'s something I wanted to talk to you about?  You\\'re nose is bleeding!  Okay, I uh, I can\\'t see you anymore.  Hey. Rachel, I-I-I\\'ve been wanting to tell you something for a while now and I really, I just have to get it out.  Okay, y\\'know how you told me I should do whatever it takes to fix my marriage?  And while that was good advice, you should know that what-what she wants…  …is for me not to see you anymore.  It\\'s awful I know, I mean, I feel terrible but I have to do this if I want my marriage to work. And I do, I have to make this marriage work. I have too. But the good thing is we can still see each other until she gets here.  You have no idea what a nightmare this has been. This is so hard.  What are you doing?  Rachel, this is your apartment.  You should\\'ve seen the look on her face. I don\\'t want Rachel to hate me! I don\\'t know what to do.  Yes! Please!  That\\'s okay.  That\\'s not advice!  Hi.  I talked to Monica, look, I\\'m the one who made the choice. I\\'m the one who\\'s making things change, so I should be the one to y\\'know, step back.  No, no, it\\'s okay. Really. They\\'re plenty of people who just see their sisters at Thanksgiving and just see their college roommates at reunions and just see Joey at Burger King. So is, is that better?  Well, what-what would you do? Rach, if you were me, what-what would you do?  I can\\'t believe this is happening.  I am so sorry.  Hey, what are you doing shopping at eight in the morning?  Now, how will they know if you’re ready?  Five.  Challenge extended.  Challenge excepted.  We’ll be starting with apples.  They have another guess.  How did you know she would buy scotch tape?

And your fly\\'s still open...  Ha, I made you look....  I couldn\\'t be inner. Monica?  No..!  Get your hands out of there! No!  Well, I just lost a job, and I\\'d like to raise the bet five bucks. Does anybody have a problem with that?  What do you mean, you fold? Hey, come on! What is this? I thought that \\'once the cards were dealt, I\\'m not a nice guy.\\' I mean, what, were you just full of it?  How many you want?  See your twenty-five...and...uh, Monica, get my purse.  OK, then get me your purse.  Oh, time\\'s up.  Yes!  All right, I got 48.  Oh, right. Sorry. But Tag\\'s not coming; his girlfriend came into town, so he\\'s spending Thanksgiving with her.  Well, I was going to, but then I figured, you know... you\\'re food is so delicious and perfect, you can never have too many of those pumpkin things.  Seriously, it\\'s moving!  Oh, I\\'m sorry.  Wait a minute. Do you not like all dogs? I mean, not even puppies?  Oh, wait before you guys go, can I just ask you a question?  When a guy breaks up with his girlfriend, what is an appropriate amount of time to wait before you make a move?  Interesting.  Huh. A moo-point?  You\\'re right, I\\'m sorry. Thank you. Okay, that\\'s what I\\'m gonna do.  Hey!  How are you holding up?  Yeah? I\\'m sorry about your girlfriend.  So were you guys together a long time?  Now that she broke up with you?  Yeah. Hmmmm.  No…Yeah, all the time, constantly. It\\'s terrifying. But you know that I figure it…it has to work out.  Because, uh—it has to.  Yeah, I know, I do. I really do.  Uh, yeah, well, see, he… Joey knows, that I\\'m-I\\'m very insecure about my back and, and…you\\'re hugging me, so obviously you are not repulsed by it, yeah!  Yeah, I admit it. I have a crush on you, and uh, and, and I know that\\'s crazy because we work together, and-and nothing could ever happen, and the last thing I want to do is-is to freak you out or make you feel uncomfortable. Which is why it would be really great if you said something right about now.  What?  Okay, that\\'s gonna take them a minute. Do you have anything else you wanna get off your chest?  Oh, hi! How are you doing?  Oh.  Look, um, I think we should talk about what happened on the terrace.  Ah, I-I never should have said what I said. It—y’know what? It just doesn\\'t matter how I feel. I mean we work together, so nothing could really ever happen between us, and what I would love is just to go to work on Monday, and-and never talk about this again, okay? Big day Monday lots to do. So, we\\'re okay?  Oh, god, I know it, that I freaked you out.  Really?  Okay, well, that\\'s one less thing we have to do on Monday.  Monica what?  What is the emergency?!  Well, I like the pretty little drawing of you in the wedding dress.  Okay. Okay. Okay. Umm, maybe you can start with, \"Chandler, even though we were friends; there was a part of me that always knew I wanted more.\"  Hey!  Hey, what have you guys been up to?  I can’t believe they’ve been together for three years.  I don’t know why they didn’t just tell us.  What?!  Oh my God!  OH MY GOD!!!  Phoebe!! Phoebe!! It\\'s okay!! It\\'s okay!!  I KNOW!! I KNOW!! I KNOW!  Yes, I know! And Joey knows! But Ross doesn\\'t know so you have to stop screaming!!  Nothing! Oh God, we\\'re just so excited that you want to get this apartment!  All right honey, we\\'d better go if we wanna catch that movie.  Are you kidding?!  Joey!  Ugh, I knew it! Oh I cannot believe those two!  Joey look, just look at it this way, the sooner Phoebe breaks Chandler the sooner this is all over and out in the open.  Okay!  You really think it would be that different?  Well, things change.  Hey, who\\'s this little naked guy?  Aww, look at the little thing.  Wow, Monica, you look just like your grandmother. How old was she there?  Well, we were just talkin’ about you guys gettin’ married and how great it is.  Oh, can we read them?  Okay.  Yeah, I forget which ones.  Good, Pheebs. What\\'d you buy?  You went shopping for fur?  You bought boobs?  Oh, this is so cute.  Did you just say Hi, Jew?  Phoebe, that is juice, squeezed from a person.  They took Ben to the park. Where\\'ve you been?  Mon, if uh you were at lunch alone, how come it cost you uh 53 dollars?  And sorta just put the receipt back in your pocket?  Monica, what is with you? Who\\'d you have lunch with?  Who?  What?!  You were with Julie?  Oh. Oh my God.  Yeah, right.  Sure!  Oh, so you just sort of happened to leave it in here?  Well that works out good, because I\\'m not listening.  Oh, I\\'m sorry, did my back hurt your knife?  Yes.  So. I just thought the two of us should hang out for a bit. I mean, you know, we\\'ve never really talked. I guess you\\'d know that, being one of the two of us, though, right?  Really? Me?  Well, you\\'re not totally paranoid.  Um, ok, uh, oh god, um, when you and uh Ross first started going out, it was really hard for me, um, for many reasons, which I\\'m not gonna bore you with now, but um, I just, I see how happy he is, you know, and how good you guys are together, and um, Monica\\'s always saying how nice you are, and god I hate it when she\\'s right.  Yeah, that\\'d be great. I\\'d love it.  All right, Julie.  Here you go Pheebs. Who else wants one of my special homemade brownies?  Phoebe, what? Umm...what?!  And all these people actually died?  Phoebe, your in pain, would you just go to the dentist, just go.  I promise.  Joey, you can’t keep this to yourself, if you know about this, you have to tell him.  Whoa! Wait! Hello! What about me?  We’re not?!  All right, I like that.  I cannot push it in!  Okay, okay, okay.  Okay.  Or. We could put a hat on his head.  We need a hat..  Oh God, oh God, it’s sowed on though.  Okay.  Oh, it’s just like a bloodbath in here today.  Right.  See Pheebs, I promised you no one would die, didn’t I?  Okay, I heard that.  Uh-huh.  Oh yeah! Y\\'know, if it’s not a headboard, it’s just not worth it.  I also said number one.  Hi!  He’s perfect, he’s never been better.  Well maybe he’s just taking a nap.  Well, we have gotta find out if he’s alive.  Are you, are you, are you sure it’s ah, a new bump? I mean, no offense, I’ve always thought of Ben as a fairly bumpy headed child.  I did!! I watched! I watched! I watched Monica bang his head against that thing!  I hope it’s still funny when you’re in hell.  I’ll get the hat.  Hey-hey, now he’s showing us his poking device.  Hi!  I can\\'t believe this! This is Emma\\'s first Thanksgiving!  Hi! Happy Thanksgiving!  Did you at least win the contest?  Can\\'t wait!  Yeah.  Well, let\\'s see... uh... I know that she has a meeting with her lawyer and then she has to make a very big poop. Why?  Oh my God! That\\'s the creepiest thing I\\'ve ever heard!  Oh! Phoebe, all babies are beautiful!  Phoebe, just the idea of pitting one baby against another, I mean, you know, and judging who\\'s cuter just for a trophy...  And a thousand dollars.  Where am I gonna get a cowgirl outfit on Thanksgiving?  Oh, take the clothes of Joey\\'s Cabbage Patch Kid.  Oh Phoebe, listen. Well, I think we gotta go. This place is really freaking me out. I\\'ve been watching this guy over there, I don\\'t think he came with a kid!  Phoebe, I think... It\\'s just too weird, I just saw a one year old running around with pantyhose on!  Oh, Phoebe! Come on! You know what, it\\'s already three o\\'clock and they haven\\'t even gotten to Emma\\'s group yet. We gotta go, we got dinner!  Phoebe, you have to calm down.  Really?  You heard them say that?  All right, okay. Alright, let\\'s give to these babies something to cry about!  No, what?  No Phoebe, I am not letting you put makeup on my baby!  Because I already did!  No...  What are you doing here!  And I won!  Yeah. That\\'s me!  She won a thousand dollars!  Well, I don\\'t know, you guys figure it out, I got to put Emma down for a nap.  Oh, God. This is bad. This is so bad.  Alright, enough, enough, come on. Let\\'s just all go in at the same time.  Oh!  So bad.  Dessert?  Congratulatioooons!  Ewww, is that what that is?  Yeah! I\\'ll cook!  Hey!  I lent them to Ross.  I\\'m so happy for you!  To Monica and Chandler... and that knocked up girl in Ohio.  Really?  No, yeah, I’ve done that.  I’ve never done that.  Um, Pheebs, so, you guys just don’t get along?  So, is this just gonna be you and Carol?  Well, isn’t, isn’t that gonna be weird?  So Pheebs, what do you want for your birthday?  Okay... Let me put it this way. Anything from Crabtree and Evelyn?  Ooh, okay... good.  You don’t even have cats.  We’ll try to keep it down.  Are you seein’ her again tonight?  This is just occurring to you?  Oh, how’d she take it?  Okay, Pheebs, can I ask? So, he’s going out with her. I mean, is it really so terrible?  Oh... Oh, Pheebs.  Oh please, they’ve been going out a week. They haven’t even slept together yet, I mean, that’s not serious.  So who’s idea was it to put everybody in the diner on skates?  What a jerk! You want me to kick his ass?  And you’re still not attracted to him at all?  Yeah, but Mon that’s totally different. He was you’re health teacher.  Oh, I am, my side still hurts from when you crashed into me yesterday.  I know.  Ow!!  Oh I see, so this suit is making a point.  Now that you’re on you’re own, you’re free to look as stupid as you like.  Yeah, come here!  Yeah. Oh! Was how you invented the cotton gin?!  I’m fine, I’m fine.  Yes I am!  No. I have got to get ready and go to a dinner at my bosses house. It’s a very big deal, there’s a lot of people there I have to meet.  Well, I will go to the hospital tomorrow, it’ll still be broken then.  But y\\'know, I could use a hand getting ready.  Look, either help me or go.  Yeah.  Careful. Light. Okay, do you know how, just sweep it across the lid. Okay? Just sweep it.  Oh-ho!  Hey! That’s just poking me in the eye!  Okay, just sweep it.  Right.  Okay, now make it even, ‘cause we don’t...  We don’t want it-it to be too much, we want it to be subtle.  Since when, since when do you think I don’t wear enough of this?  Blow it.  Sophisticated like a hooker?  Sure.  Sure, I’ll just sit next to the trans-sexual from purchasing.  Oh wait, Ross, would you just stay and help me get dressed?  Okay. Okay, great! Umm, okay, just turn around.  I don’t want you to see me naked!  Yeah, but that was different. Y’know? I mean, we were, we were going out then, now I think it’s weird.  What?  Ross! Stop that!  Come on! I don’t want you thinking of me like that any more!  Stop it! Cut it out! Cut it out!  Rosss...  O-kay!! See what you did, I’m gonna be doing it by myself now. Okay?  Oh-ow!  Ow!  Ow!  Ow!  Ow! Ow!  Okay, I do.  I really do.  Okay. Oh wait, wait-wait, you’re not gonna come with me?  Okay.  I’m sorry, I just can’t go to the hospital lookin’ like this.  Okay, you’d tell me the truth. Right?  Okay.  What thing? What thing?  What thing? What is this thing?  Oh my God!  Ross, why didn’t you tell me that?  I cannot believe you.  That is the sweetest thing, I just....  Okay.  Oh, I’m sorry I spoiled you’re evening.  Um-hmm, yeah.  Excuse me, there was no time!  Does anybody need more coffee?  Yeah, I know.  I’m serious, I really, I think I need just to have some...meaningless, sex y\\'know, with the next guy that I see.  Yeah, so?  Yes, his name is Barry, he’s a doctor, thank you very much.  Thank you. So how-how ‘bout you, are-are you seeing anybody?  Oh, but that’s okay.  Yeah.  Okay!  Bye!  Don’t say anything. I don’t wanna speak, I don’t wanna think. I just want you to take me and kiss me and make love to me right here, right now.  What?  Oh, sorry.  Oh, you’re welcome a million.  Whoa! What?! Why?!  Here?! Now?!  Well, can’t you tell her that you are not in the mood?  I don’t know.  Oh, making it worse!  Oh, was it awful?  I wrote you a letter.  Well, I’ll be waiting for you, just come up when you’re done.  You just finished?  So umm, does it?  Does it?  What are you talking about, Ross, you just said that you read it twice! Look, y\\'know what, either it does or it doesn’t, and if you have to even think about it...  Are you sure?  How was the beach?  All right, that’s it, you guys! What happened out there?  Oh-hooo, I missed you.  Ooh, I was soo nervous about that letter. But the way you owned up to everything, it just showed me how much you’ve grown. Y\\'know?  You have! Ross, you should give yourself credit. I mean my Mom never thought this would work out. It was all, “Once a cheater, always a cheater.”  Ooh, I just wish we hadn’t lost those four months, but if time was what you needed just to gain a little perspective...  Yeah! You and that girl from that copy place, which yesterday you took full responsibility for!!  What?!!  You fell asleep?!  Y\\'know I can’t believe I even thought about getting back together again! We are so over!!  Oh, oh, and hey-hey-hey, those little spelling tips will come in handy when you’re at home on Saturday nights playing Scrabble with Monica!!  And hey! Just so you know, it’s not that common! It doesn’t happen to every guy! And it is a big deal!!  Hey! Hey, Pheebs, check it out. Yeah, for my desert, I have chosen to make a traditional English truffle!  So, if-if I mess this up, there’s nothing else for dessert?  Wow, Monica, I love that, you really have faith in me. Thank you. Technical question, how do you know when uh, the butter’s done?  Her dancer friends?  Really?!  I dunno. Y’know to me he’ll always be “Jack Geller, walks in while you’re changing.”  Joey, God, your apartment is like a hundred degrees!  No!  Yeah?  Joey! Come on! I don’t wanna make any mistakes, alright? This is the only dessert and if I screw it up everybody\\'s gonna be like “Oh, remember that Thanksgiving when Rachel screwed up the trifle?”  So why don’t you just let me worry about making the trifle and you just worry about eating it, alright?  Okay...  What’s up, Ross?  Yeah!  Oh no. No Ross, don’t do this.  I just- I don’t think us getting back together is a good idea.  I thought this might happen today. Ross, I know the holidays can be rough. Y’know? And it’s probably really hard for you to be alone right now.  Joey, you’re gonna have to stop rushing me, you know what? You don’t get any dessert.  No, I’m just kidding I would never do that to you! Okay, everybody, it’s trifle time!  It sure is.  Beef.  Alright, Monica, I want you to have the first taste.  Oh oh oh, wait! You only got whipped cream in there! Ya gotta take a bite with all the layers!  Op! Wait, you dropped a pea.  Well?  Really? How good?  Okay, now what was that all about? Is it-does it not taste good? Let me try it.  ...So a bird just grabbed it, and then tried to fly away with it and, and then just dropped it on the street?  Oh, Phoebe, do I wanna hear this?  You guys! It was bananas, cream, and beef! I-I just cannot believe that you ate that so that I wouldn’t feel bad!  What?!  So?  Oh, good point.  But your divorce isn\\'t even final yet.  Op, look! Claire forgot her glasses! And she\\'s gonna be really needing these to keep an eye on that boyfriend, who, I hear, needs to keep his stapler in his desk drawer, if you know what I\\'m talking about.  I don\\'t gossip!  Well, maybe sometimes I find out things or I hear something and I pass that information on y\\'know kinda like a public service, it doesn\\'t mean I\\'m a gossip. I mean, would you call Ted Kopel a gossip?  What? They were like this!  I think they\\'re very nice.  Oh, Joey, I have such a problem!  Okay. Okay. Okay. Joey, I have got to tell you something!  Oh my God, it\\'s so huge, but you just have to promise me that you cannot tell anyone.  Yes! Yes! Yes, you do want to know! This is unbelievable!  What? What secrets? You know secrets? What are they?  That really is something; that\\'s really cool.  Good luck, honey!  Hey, uh, Joey?  Remember that big thing I was gonna tell you about?  I\\'m not gonna tell you, but if you found out on your own, that would be okay and then we could talk about it. Right?  Yeah!  Do you know something?  I might know something too.  Oh no, I can\\'t tell you until you tell me what you know.  Well then I can\\'t tell you what I know.  AND YOU KNOW!!!  Chandler and Monica?!! Oh, this is unbelievable!! How long have you known?  Ohhh, yeah, me too.  Well don’t—What happened to Jessica’s body?!  You don’t know do you?  Hi.  Oh, we’re leaving. Bye Kash.  Say hi to Wally.  Hi!  I thought I was a complete idiot.  Oh! Oh, I think I’m gonna throw up a little bit. What did you say?  What?!  Okay Joey, first of all Kash Ford is not people. Second of all, what did he say when you told him I was pregnant?  Good-good, don’t tell him. Don’t tell him. Just have him call me okay?  Okay, you go do it! I’ll come back to that set! I’ll meet more actors! I’ll meet ‘em all!  Hey, what do you think is a better excuse for why I’m not drinking on this date tonight. \"Umm, I’m a recovering alcoholic. I’m a Mormon,\" or \"I got so hammered last night I’m still a little drunk?\"  Hi!  Oh no, I can’t. I got a date.  Yeah. Why? Is that weird for you?  Yeah! All right, I’ll see you guys later.  Thank you.  Hi!  Well I’m alone and I just bought fifteen dollars worth of candy bars, what do you think?  I made the mistake of telling him that I was pregnant.  Well better than you, but y’know still not what you want.  He got all weird and sputtery and then he said uh, \"Yeah, I hear those hemorrhoids are a bitch.\"  Doesn’t he?  Yes.  Okay.  Oh it’s all right. I’m guess I’m just done with the whole dating thing. It’s one more thing in my life that’s suddenly completely different. This is hard.  Thanks sweetie.  Oh no, I think I’m gonna go home and eat ten candy bars.  Oh you did, there are twenty in here.  Good night.  So, which of this kitchen stuff is mine?  And?  Look at that!  What?!  No-no, I bought those.  Well, who wouldn’t?!  And Mrs.?!  What?!!  Yeah honey you don’t believe her do you?  Ross, hey you know what might make it less boring?  Some uh, some visual aides.  Hey Pheebs, you’re still alive! How are you doing?  Pheebs, what-what are you doing?  Oh yeah, scared the hell out of me. I thought we’d lost you forever. Pheebs, you lie down?  Monica!  Did-did you take these back?  Oh yeah, they’re really great! Aren’t they?  Hey!  Wow, that’s great Ross, I’m sorry we weren’t more supportive before.  Well, we’re a little early, the lecture doesn’t end for 15 minutes.  Yeah, and not a very good one.  No! They are mine!  You stole them from me!!  Yeah that seems fair. We never use them.  Well…  Yeah, I mean, come on Ross, no one will even notice. I mean they’re probably not even listening!  Of course they’re listening to you! Everybody listens to you.  Really? Really?!  Hey!  Really?! How do you know?  Oh, I’m sorry.  Uh no, he’s not. Can I take a message?  Ross got married again—Nooooooo!!!!!!!!!  Ross!! Are you crazy?! I am still your wife!! What, were you just never gonna tell me?!! What the hell is wrong with you?!!!! Ugh, I could just kill you!!!!  Oh I don’t know honey. It’s gonna be really late.  I know. I’m sorry. Look, I’ll make a deal with you all right? Okay?  For every night that you’re asleep before I get home from work...  I will wake you up in a way that’s proved very popular in the past.  Right.  Somebody got in late last night.  When did this happen?  Monica, what are you doing?  Do you have any ice?  Yeah, I know. I had the greatest day though, I got to sit in on the meeting with the reps from Calvin Klien. I told my boss I liked this line of lingerie, she ordered a ton of it. How was your day?  But ah, you’re safe from it if it’s in the freezer?  How often do you read it?  Well, umm, I guess I read Little Women more than once. But I mean that’s a classic, what’s so great about The Shining?  All right.  Okay.  Yeah.  Oh, Danny just went into room 217.  Oh, no, meh-nah-nah-nah, come on you’re gonna ruin it!  Joey! I can’t believe you just did that!  All right, okay, Laurie proposes to Jo, and she says no, even though she’s still in love with him, and then he ends up marring Amy.  Eh. Beth dies.  Um-hmm.  What?!  No. She doesn’t die.  Because, I wanted to hurt you.  I’m sorry, I was just thinking you’re day could still pick up.  What?  Awwww.  Joey?  Do you want to put the book in the freezer?  Okay.  I am so gonna miss watching you freak people out like that!  You-you\\'re not wearing a jacket.  Hi, Pheebs? Okay, so just spoke to the nurse and the reason that your doctor is late is because uh, she\\'s not coming.  Honey, listen, y\\'know what? The nurse said the doctor is wonderful.  They\\'re male nurses.  Anyway, they want to take us out Saturday night! What do you say?  What? What are you talking about?! You-you\\'re the one who\\'s been telling me to get over Ross and move on. I\\'m moving on, and you\\'re moving on with me. Come on, give me one good reason why you don\\'t wanna go.  What?  Okay, you\\'re coming with me, and I also told them that if we\\'re still here when they get off that we\\'ll go down to the cafeteria and have some Jell-O with them.  Joey, how do you make that dirty?  Honey, y\\'know I just gotta tell you, I think this is such a terrific thing you\\'re having these babies for Frank and Alice.  Yeah!  Yeah!  Ohh, I\\'m gonna be on the news!  Okay, Phoebe, honey, you gotta be kidding. I mean, you know you cannot keep one of these babies!  Yes! Yes! Yes, I do! I do know! Frank and Alice are gonna want to keep all of their children!  Phoebe, no! This is, this is insane.  Me?!  No! Forget it! I am not gonna ask Frank to give you one of his kids!!  No, I haven\\'t had a chance to be alone with him yet.  Y\\'know who I always liked? Mork.  Yeah, but umm… Yes, but, Fonzie was already cool, so he wasn\\'t hurt, right?  Hi!  Hi!  Oh, honey, don’t worry. She\\'s gonna make it on time.  Yeah. So Frank, three babies. Whew, that just seems like a lot, huh?  Yeah, fair enough.  Oh, how does he look? How does he look?  Yeah, umm, no honey.  So does it really hurt as bad as they say?  Hey, Mon, I was just doing the dishes!  Yeah, yeah, I was just about to take a break anyways, so…  Oh.  Yeah. Yeah. Definitely, well it definitely took me by surprise, but I’m okay.  Yeah.  Oh, that’s sweet.  I mean maybe you didn’t hear about a serious relationship called me and Joshua?  Oh, no-no-no, no-no-no, it has become, it has—yeah. Oh no, those were four great dates.  Yeah. Oh, yeah. And I mean, the connection, I mean y’know, emotionally, mentally, physically…  I know isn’t it? It’s like I’m right there with Joshua.  You are right there with Emily. And it’s y’know, it’s kinda like…. it’s a tie! Well, I gotta get, I gotta get back to the dishes.  Oh yeah? Fine.  Oh yeah, no, what’s that?  That would be great!  Handling it? What do you mean, handling it? There’s nothing to handle. Now, maybe I would have a problem with this if it wasn’t for me and Joshua. Y’know, they’re not gonna get married anyway!  Come on! They rushed into this thing so fast it’s ridiculous! I mean, they’re gonna be engaged for like what? A year? And somewhere along the way, one of them is gonna realise what they’ve done and they’re call the whole thing off. I’m telling ya, you’re gonna be dancing at my wedding before you’re dancing at there’s.  Why not?  Nothing.  In a month?  You mean, you mean 30 days?  From now?  Well, that’s great.  Hi!  I’m more than okay, I am really, really happy! Wanna know why?  ‘Cause I am really happy about us. I think we are, I think we are so on the right track! Y’know? I mean, I think we are working, I think we are clicking. Y’know?  Yeah-yeah, y’know if-if there was just like one little area where I—that I think we need—we would need to work on; I-I would think it was we’re just not crazy enough!  Oh, I know, I know, it’s-it’s so, it’s so totally like, \"Whoa! Can we do this?\" Y’know, I mean, but I mean it just feels right! Don’t you think? It does! I mean, it just feels right, don’t you think?  Well, I did my best to convince him that I’m not some crazy girl who is dying to get married—I’m just going through a hard time.  Well uh, his answering machine was very understanding. Ugh. I feel blue.  Yeah, maybe, but I don’t think I even care. I don’t think he’s the one I’m sad about. Y’know, I know that I said that I am totally okay with Ross getting married, but as it turns out, I don’t think I’m handling it all that well.  And I-I am just trying to figure out why.  Well, yeah, y’know how Ross and I were on again, off again, on again, off again? I guess I just figured that somewhere down the road, we would be on again.  Yeah, well, you uh, better make it for three.  Three people. Joshua’s not gonna be there.  Uh, well, I think, I think he broke up with me.  Well, apparently he scares easy.  It’s okay. Sometimes, things don’t work out the way you’d thought they would.  Yeah.  Yeah! I got my girls.  What?  Y’know, I gotta tell ya, this really does put in a better mood.  I’m not gonna marry Chandler!  Yeah.  Hi...  Rachel...  Phoebe’s...  leave...  Wait, I-I just said \"leave.\"  Phoebe, come on that\\'s silly.  No, I have all of the good words. OK, fine, fine, we can switch.  Okay.  Everybody…  Rachel…  Phoebe’s…  What?  Phoebe, come on can we finish this later? Cause I wanna go running before it gets dark. Oh! Why don\\'t you come with me?!  Yeah, it\\'ll be fun. We\\'ll run in the park. It\\'ll be like our first y’know roommate bonding thing.  Yeah and there\\'s really cute guys there.  OK!  Now wait a minute. You just took all the words!  You guys, I\\'m telling you, when she runs, she looks like a cross between Kermit The Frog and The Six Million Dollar Man.  Oh! I used to do that too!  Yeah, yeah and you know what, I know she\\'s gonna wanna run again, I just don\\'t know how to get out of it, I mean, I live with her.  You\\'re right, you\\'re right. I should just tell her the truth.  Pheebs, Monica tripped me, I don\\'t think I can ever run again, ever!  Ankle.  No, no Phoebe no, I was...no. You know what, I was, I was actually just checking to, see, if I could run. And I can!  No, wait Phoebe.  Hey Phoebe, can I talk to you for a second?  Well, I-I should\\'ve told you the truth.  Well, it\\'s embarrassing. People were looking at us like we were crazy.  Because they\\'re people.  Yes, but still. They\\'re people…with eyes.  I-I am not uptight—Hey-hey-hey-oh-oh! Listen, I am not uptight, man.  Oh honey, I\\'m so sorry, you were right, this feels great!  Yes, my sister\\'s giving us her place for the weekend.  I know...  I mean, we are way past the fling thing, I mean, I am feeling things that I\\'ve only read about in Danielle Steele books, you know? I mean, when I\\'m with him, I\\'m totally, totally...  Pheebs!  Oh, right, that\\'s me!  \"Ooo,\" what?  Hi Pheebs!  Well, sure...just a sec, though, \\'cause Paolo\\'s on his way over.  Oh, Pheebs, Pheebs...  All right, well, you\\'re right, these are the best oatmeal cookies I\\'ve ever had.  I guess you don\\'t.  I need some milk.  No...oh, I feel so stupid! Oh, I think about the other day with you guys and I was all \"Oh, Paolo, he\\'s so great, he makes me feel so...\" Oh, God, I\\'m so embarrassed!  Pheebs, if I had never met him this never would have happened!  I don\\'t know...right, he\\'s the pig!  Oh, God, he\\'s such a pig,  He\\'s like a big disgusting...  ...pig...pig man!  Ok, Ok, Pheebs...  Oh, God...  No, no, trust, me, it\\'s, it\\'s, it\\'s much better that I know. Uh, I just liked it better before it was better...  Hey.  Ooh, I\\'ve been better...  Oh, Ross...  Oh Ross, you\\'re so great!  Oh...  ...medium...hmm...any cookies left?  No. I just need to be by myself for a while, you know? I just got to figure out what I want  No, I know, I know, and I\\'m sure your little boy is not going to grow up to be one.  What?  Uh...no. No, no, in fact, you\\'re not having a boy.  Hey, so did everything go okay with the annulment?  Ross, thank you. Hey, do you guys wanna go see a movie?  Oh? Yeah! Sure!  Oh but Phoebe, we’re gonna be late for the movie.  Yeah, we’re, we’re actually just gonna walk ‘cause it’s right up there at the Angelica.  What was that?!  I haven’t seen it yet!  Noooooooo!!  Hey!  Ugh, the worse day! Y’know, you think you’re making progress at work and then your boss calls you Raquel.  I believe you. So, it was right in the middle of a staff meeting so of course no one else wants to correct her so everyone else is calling me Raquel! By the end of the day, the mailroom guys were calling me Rocky!  What?  Oh my God! That’s so great! I’m so happy for you guys!  And that was so sweet of you to ask! Oh my God, the three of us are gonna have such a good time living together!  And Chandler, you’re gonna have to watch those long showers you take in the morning because you know Raquel can’t be late.  Um-hmm.  Monica, where did you get these?!  Hey!  Okay!  Okay.  Wow! Mon, thanks! I love this plate!  Mon, honey you’re not dying. I’m just moving out. Y’know, I mean we’re gonna see each other all the time.  Are you okay? You’re not blinking.  Oh, all right. But y’know I gotta say, I don’t, I don’t think six years counts as an era.  What is the matter with you?!  All right, fine, but don’t get mad at me. It’s-it’s just a little hard to believe.  Well y’know, it’s you guys. You-you do this kind of stuff! Y’know? I mean, you-you were gonna get married in Vegas and then you backed out! I guess I’m not upset because I don’t see you guys going through with it. I’m sorry.  But I…  It is? Really?  I mean it’s the end of an era!  Monica and Chandler are really moving in here and I have to move out and everything is changing.  Thank you.  Wait, you can\\'t go away this weekend! It\\'s Emma\\'s birthday!  We\\'re having a party.  No, that day... that won\\'t be her real birthday!  Well, can\\'t you just go to Vermont the next day?  And I mean, you know, you guys... This is a big deal. I mean, how can we have her first birthday party without her aunt and her uncle!  You know Pheebs, when I was little, on my birthday, my daddy would hide a present in every room of the house, and then he would draw a treasure map to help me find \\'em all.  Oh, good, good! We had this idea to make a birthday video for Emma and we\\'ll give it to her when she is 18.  Oh no, it\\'s still nap time. But she\\'ll be up soon.  I said it\\'s still nap time.  Hey Joey, will you please set this up for people to put Emma\\'s presents on?  Oh, she\\'s still napping  Look, I know that you guys really want to get to Vermont and this isn\\'t a really big deal to you, but it really is to us, ok? Emma will never have a first birthday again.  No really, she didn\\'t sleep well last night, so we can\\'t wake her up.  Oh! Emma might like what?  What did you get her?  Well, this sounds like fun! Well, you know what? Actually? People are getting a little antsy waiting Emma to wake up from her nap, so would you mind performing them once now?  So, Joey, what are you gonna do for us?  Oh, ok, which one?  Oh, Phoebe, I’m sorry! Phoebe has prepared something as well.  Is that it?  Ross, um, don’t forget to get a shot of Emma’s cake. It’s in a box in the fridge.  Oh, you\\'re gonna love this cake. I got it from a bakery in New Jersey, Corino’s.  Well, anyway, they make these great novelty cakes, in all different shapes, and if you give them a photo, they’ll copy it in icing!  Yes! On a cake shaped like a bunny.  Why you guys this isn\\'t funny, all right? If I wanted this cake to be a disaster I would have baked it myself!  OOH! God! Sorry!  Emma\\'s awake.  I can\\'t believe this. This is her first birthday. She\\'s awake. We\\'re not even there. Everybody left. We still have this stupid obscene cake.  Oh, why do you even bother? I already ruined her first birthday... And do you know how important these early experiences are Ross? Very! According to the back cover of that book that you gave me.  What?  Well, I\\'m very impressed.  I don\\'t care that you left. I\\'m just glad that you\\'re here. Thanks you guys!  What?  Oh! Emma, that\\'s right! You\\'re that many!  Oh!... Oh and Emma, look at your stuffed animals lined up so neatly!  Oh yeah, nothing! These are happy tears! This is just what I wanted.  Okay.  Yeah.  You want me to just quit my job so that you can feel like you’ve got a girlfriend?  Oh my God. I cannot keep having this same fight with you Ross! Look, urrgh, maybe we should take a break.  No. A break from us.  Then, we had this big, stupid fight, and I said I wanted to take a break, I don’t want to take a break.  Nobody.  Umm, honey, look he just came over to....  Hey.  Well, we never actually got to dinner.  No, we kinda broke up instead.  Yeah, but it’s okay, because when Ross left Mark came over.  No.  No, no-no, it’s okay, calm down. Mark and I talked, and I realised how much I love your stupid brother, and, yeah, we got our problems, but I really want to make it work.  Eh, I’m just so sorry I put you through it. And, I y\\'know, I don’t want to get back together over a machine.  So, I love you.  And y\\'know what, I’m gonna, I’m gonna go to bed now, but ah, on my way to work tomorrow morning, I’m gonna stop by around 8:30.  Bye.  Hi. Ohhh, you got my message.  So what do you say? Can I be your girlfriend again?  I can’t talk to you. I can’t even look at you right now!  Just get away from me!  A mistake?! What were you trying to put it in? Her purse?!  Ross, you had sex with another woman!  Just get out! Now!!  Okay! All right! How was she?  Was she good?  Come on Ross! You said you wanted to talk about it, let’s talk about it!! How was she?  Good different?  And yet she was worth jeopardising our relationship!!  We were on a break!  You think you’re gonna get out of this on a technicality?  Well, you sure had a hell of a time at the wake!  God! And to have to hear about it from Gunther!!  Oh, that is so sweet. I think I’m falling in love with you all over again.  All right. Let’s say I had slept with Mark. Would you have been able to forgive me?  You’d be okay if you knew that Mark had kissed me, and been naked with me, and made love to me?  You knew that our hot, sweaty, writhing bodies were....  I’m thinking, I’m gonna order a pizza.  With ah, extra anchovies.  Yeah, and could you please chop some up and just put it right there in the sauce?  Well, I should think so. You slept with someone.  That’s....  That is neither here nor there.  Yeah, what the hell did I know!  Then how come it is?  Oh, Ross, you had to, I mean, he was humping everything in sight. I mean, I have a Malibu Barbi that will no longer be wearing white to her wedding.  Ya know, in crazy world, that means you\\'re married.  Oh, Phoebe, that really cute guy is here again.  And she\\'s not crazy?  Oh my God.  Not at all inappropriate!  Well, so what\\'re you gonna do?  No no no, wait, I wanna see what happens.  Well how can that be, you were just kissing Sabrina?  You\\'re kidding.  OK.  Now just how big of a star is Marcel?  What what what what?  Ya think?  No, was he any good in it?  Wow, so why don\\'t you go talk to him?  What, so you go over there, you tell him you think he\\'s cute, what\\'s the worst that could happen?  OK, I\\'m doin\\' it for ya.  Excuse me. Hi.  Um, this is gonna sound kinda goofy but uhhm, my friend over there, who cooks by the way, um, she thinks you\\'re cute.  I, I don\\'t know, um, do you think you\\'re cute? OK, we\\'re kinda gettin\\' off the track here. Um, I was supposed to come here and tell you my friend thinks you\\'re cute. So what should I tell her?  Agh, what a jerk. I kept talking about you and he kept asking me out. I mean, naturally, you know, I said no.  He just kept asking, and asking, and asking, and asking, and asking, and asking.  Jean-Claude she said yes, I\\'ll see you tonight. Thank you.  And then Jean-Claude took me to that place Crossroads and that\\'s where we hung out with Drew Barrymore.  Does anybody need anything?  That is so unfair.  That is the most ridiculous.  I did not sell you out.  Ow, you stop flicking.  Oh, what do you, you want me to stop seeing him, is that what you want?  You want me to just call him up and tell him that you\\'re seeing him instead? That\\'s what you want?  Oh that\\'s what you want.  Fine.  OK, OK, that is my favorite sweater, that is my third date sweater.  You give me back my sweater or it\\'s handbag marinara.  Oh yeah. Well, at least I wasn\\'t too chicken to tell some guy I thought he was cute.  I\\'ll help you throw out your purse.  Well, I\\'m sorry I went out with him when I knew you liked him.  Impressive.  Oh yeah.  Who are you saying \"check\" too?  Have fun!  Oh, I know.  What?!  Yeah, well, I gotta work, I’m sorry.  Because, I can’t! Ross, I told you, no. I can’t.  Oh, honey! Don’t get up! What do you need?  Come on! I am here to take care of you! What do you need? Anything.  Okay, that is all you.  Oh, I don’t know. I guess we have to eat.  I’m just bummed about the way I left things with Ross. I shouldn’t have lied to him about having to work. He seemed so mad at me.  I’m not in love with Ross!  Phoebe, I’m going to Ross’s wedding because he is my ex-boyfriend and that would be really uncomfortable. Not because, I’m still in love with him! I mean, hey, y’know, I like Ross as much as the next guy, y’know? Clearly I have feelings for him, but feelings don’t mean love! I mean, I still have loving feelings for Ross. Yeah! But, I have, I have continuing feelings of love, but that doesn’t mean that-that I’m still in love with him. Y’know? I-I have sexual feelings for him, but I do love him—Ohh! Oh my God! Oh my—why didn’t you tell me?!!  We?!  You all know? Does Ross know?  Oh, I can not believe you didn’t tell me!  Manhattan does not have enough stores.  You can?  Um-hmm.  Okay.  Ooh, is this one of those things where you throw it in a bag with some graveyard dirt and hang it from a north-facing tree?  I can do that. I certainly did it when we were going out.  I don’t know, his uh, his hair never really bothered me that much, and y’know it was always more crunchy than it was greasy.  Okay.  All right.  Okay.  Ow!  Well, I like you less!  Pheebs?  Do you remember where the duck food is?  Yeah, I know, I know, I know he does. But I have to tell him how I feel! He deserves to have all the information and then he can make an informed decision.  Ohh—Do you think he will?!  Ohh, good.  Ohh, thank you, thank you, thank you.  Hi, I’m back. Listen, I need to...  Hello. I need to get on the 11 o\\'clock flight.  Okay, you know what/ You’re going to have to call that plane and tell them to swing around and come and pick me up.  Sure, you know what? Come on, we’ll just tell them that there was like a problem with like the \"engine\".  Look, If I don’t get to London!! He is going to marry that other girl!!!  Yeah?  ...And so then I realized. All this stuff I had been doing. proposing to Joshua, lying to Ross about why I couldn’t come to the wedding. Was all just a way of...  Ehh, pardon me?  But he has to know how I feel!  Hi!  What?!  Thank you Joey. You know what? I\\'m not even sure I can have caffeine.  Yeah. Just to be sure I\\'m gonna call Dr. Wiener.  Dr. Wiener.  Oh you know what, you sound just like his wife!  Yes, of course there is! Okay? I\\'m not insane!  Hiccups.  Yeah well, not anymore I can\\'t. He fired us! What are we gonna do? We have to find a pediatrician. Wait wait, Monica said that when you guys were growing up, you really liked your doctor. What was his name?  Argh! Why does everything happen to me?!  What? What, do you mean you\\'re not feeling well? What do you have? Is it Rubella? Because don\\'t go near Emma, she has not had that shot.  Great! Now he\\'s gonna know it was me!  It\\'s impossible to find a good doctor. I mean, how do you know the good ones from the ones who are gonna push their penis against your knee?  We\\'ve got to find a new pediatrician. Ross was getting sick last night, and I think Emma may have caught it.  Ross said he died.  Oh, great! Well, then I\\'m gonna take Emma to see him. I wonder why Ross said that he died.  Why? What was it?  Hi, my name is Rachel Green, I have an appointment for Emma.  Ross, seriously! You\\'ve gotta go to an appropriate doctor.  Okay, wow, wow, wow. Watch the tongue people, we\\'ve got a baby over here.  That is right and traditionally the daddy is supposed to give the mummy a present but I am prepared to let that go.  Well—Really? I thought Chandler was your best friend.  Ooooo!  Oh you guys thanks for doing this.  He’s downstairs getting the rest of the stuff out of the cab.  Well, you more then me, but he can’t stay to mad at me. I mean, I just had his baby.  Yeah, I’m not so sure you should be here when he comes up.  Oh great, the pacifiers?  The burping clogs?  The diapers?  Alright thanks, oh Ross could you stop by the coffee house and get me a muffin?  Umm let me think...What do I want, what d-o I w-a-n-t...  Blueberry.  Thanks.  God how long do you think that’s gonna last?  Y’know I can’t even worry about that right now, cause I got the cutie little baby, oh I can’t believe how much I love her, I can’t get enough of her, like right now I miss her.  I actually miss her.  Oh god look at her sleeping.  Oh, I love her so much!  Oh, I think I’m gonna wake her up.  Oh I’m sorry mummy’s so sorry go back to sleep go back to sleep. Shh.   Shhh! Go back to sleep  Yeah, I’m not so sure.  I already fed her.  Oh no, you guys, just stay here, I’m gonna go check her diaper, Pheebs you wanna come?  Oh my God! How long has she been crying?  You guys, I’m doing the best I can, anyone else is welcome to try.  Oh god what am I gonna do you guys, I can’t even comfort my own baby! I’m the worst mother ever!  Yeah I don’t think dressing provocatively is going to help me here! Oh my god just please take her.  Oh my God! You got her to stop crying!  You are the official baby crier stopper!  You’re never leaving the apartment!  That’s your new job, day and night, she starts crying I need you here.  Okay so listen I’m gonna go lay down.  You know what I really really want?  I wanna sleep, I wanna eat, I wanna take a shower, I mean before she wakes up and we gotta do this all over again.  I mean I got news for you mister, Emma?  Not easy.  No its really okay… Monica!  Hey! How was basketball?  Oh, no! Who did that?  She was just crawling around and she found him, so I just let her sleep with him. That\\'s all right? Isn\\'t it?  Joey... are you sure? I mean, I know how much you love him!  All right... Oh, Emma loves him!  What are you doing?  Oh, oh thanks. Alright well, now that I\\'m up I\\'m going to go to the bathroom.  Joey, Emma\\'s right here! You promised not to bring girls home in the middle of the day anymore.  Oh that\\'s so great, now Emma has two Hugsy\\'s.  Oh you know what? When I was a little girl I had a little pink pony named Cotton. Oh I loved her so much, I took her everywhere, I would braid her tail...  Should I be concerned that a button fell off the old Hugsy and I can\\'t find it?  Oh, I don\\'t think she likes the new Hugsy.  Yeah, I think she wants the old one back.  Joey, come on!  I\\'m trying to put Emma down for a nap, have you seen Hugsy?  Original.  Then what\\'s that big lump under your covers?  That\\'s not Monica!  Yeah! And she\\'s comforted by him because she loves her uncle Joey so much.  Are you gonna... you\\'re going to take Hugsy away from a little child?  Pardon?  OK, I\\'m guessing this is from...  Well, thank you, Melanie.  Who\\'s this from?  It was like months ago. We were walking by this antique store, and I saw this pin in the window, and I told him it was just like one my grandmother had when I was a little girl. Oh! I can\\'t believe he remembered!  What did you just say?  No, no, no.... the, um, the... \\'love\\' part?  Oh.... my God.  I mean, this is unbelievable.  I-I-I don\\'t know.  I don\\'t know. Maybe I\\'ll know when I see him.  Ross! Excuse me, pardon me, excuse me....  Hi.  Oh, no, no, I don\\'t have one. I just need to talk to my friend.  No, I know, but I—he just went on. He\\'s right there, he\\'s got the blue jacket on, I... can I j-just...  OK, alright, OK, um... then could you please, uh... just give him a message for me? Please? This is very important.  Uh... I don\\'t know.  I don\\'t know. I don\\'t know... I thought about it all the way there, and I thought about it all the way back... and, uh, oh, you guys, y\\'know, it\\'s Ross. Y\\'know what I mean? I mean, it\\'s Ross.  I don\\'t know, I mean, this is just my initial gut feeling... but I\\'m thinking... oh, I\\'m thinking it\\'d be really great.  I don\\'t know... sometimes it doesn\\'t.  No!  No, I\\'m just....  Wha...  No! There is.. there is noone else!  Yeah.  From you. I exchanged the blouse you got me.  Uh, yeah. Uh, Monica, y\\'know, honey, I\\'ve been thinking about it and I\\'ve decided this—this whole Ross thing, it\\'s just not a good idea.  Because, I feel like I wouldn\\'t just be going out with him. I would be going out with all of you. Oh, and there would just be all this pressure, and I don\\'t wanna...  Monica, nothing has even happened yet, and you\\'re already so...  Who is it?  C\\'mon up.  Would you excuse me, please? I\\'m trying to have a date here.  So I\\'m thinking about you. So what?  Well... he happens to be a very nice... guy....  Ross, it\\'s too hard.  Ross, you\\'re like my best friend.  If we broke up, and I lost you...  Well, have you been involved with someone where you haven\\'t broken up?  I don\\'t know... I mean, I\\'ve never looked at you that way before.  Wow.  Right! You\\'re right!  You know what?  So uh, Pheebs, honey, how are those mood swings coming?  Whoa! Hey-hey, you planning on inviting us?  Hormones!  Nooo!  All right fine! You’re not invited to the party we’re gonna have either.  Well umm…  Little village people.  Oh, that is so sweet!  Huh. Except, Phoebe’s not gonna be the one that gets to dress them.  Oh my God! We are throwing the most depressing baby shower ever!  Oh, and somebody can get those leather pants she’s always wanted!  No we…  …hormones, yeah.  Oh, well, actually we were just talking about me not going to Ross’s wedding.  It just might be too hard, given the history and all that…  Well, h-how is this like that?  Good.  You what?  Okay. It’s okay. We’re gonna be okay. Y’know what? It’s okay. I’m gonna, I’m gonna, I’m gonna boil some water and just rip up some sheets!  I don’t know!  I still don’t get how you know when it’s false labour.  Well, isn’t that a good thing? You said you were sick of this.  No, really. Really, Pheebs, you’re not gonna be the one worrying about saving for college, or yelling at them when they’re bad, y’know, or deciding to put them on Ritalin when they just won’t calm down. Y’know?  And you just get to be cool Aunt Phoebe!  And y’know what else, oh my God, are they gonna love you.  Oh!  What?!  Hi! Hi Ben!  Oh, yeah go ahead.  No. No.  Awww, just like his daddy.  What-what about Monica?  Huh umm…  Well that—y’know it’s just uh, I’ve never done that before. Me and him alone.  Okay. Okay. Okay. Uh, what do I, what do I do with him?  Okay.  Yeah I think so.  Okay. Uh, want something-want something to drink?  Uh great! How do you feel about Diet Coke?  Water it is.  Ben y’know when uh, when you were a baby, you and I used to hang out all the time. ‘Cause I was, I was your daddy’s girlfriend.  No, I’m not.  Hey! We were not on a—Okay. That’s fine! Fine. Y’know what Ben? One day when you are a lot older I am going to tell you that entire story over a pitcher of real margaritas, okay?  Oh, you’re one of those. But y’know what? I have two sisters of my own and we just-just tortured each other.  Well y’know, we would umm, repeat everything the other said, or uh, we’d jump out of closets to scare each other, or switch the sugar for the salt so they’d put salt on their cereal.  Yeah? You like that one?  Yeah, I-I-I-I’m funny Ben, but I’m not stupid. Okay?  Coming.  Uh-oh.  Oh that.  Oh, come on! Saran Wrap on the toilet seat, you don’t think that’s just a little funny?!  Hi!  Well y’know I was just in the neighborhood and I passed by your building and I thought to myself, \"What’s up with Carol and sweet, little Ben?\"  Okay.  Don’t do that.  Seriously, your dad doesn’t like pranks.  Oh damnit!  No! Don’t say that! Don’t say that!  No don’t! Go back to repeating!  Oh crap!  So now what have we agreed?  And-and what else?  Very good.  I’m just visiting my good friend Carol.  Yeah!  Carol…Lesbian?  What line?  All right, I’m sorry. I’m sorry I didn’t tell you but you were so mad already!  Okay, maybe they are not funny to you…  Or Carol! But they’re funny to kids and who is it hurting?!  That was you?! We heard about you in Junior High! Did you really just shake your fist in the air and shout, \"I will be revenged?!\"  Fine. Fine, but I’ll have you know that once I taught him that stuff he called me Fun Aunt Rachel. And I loved being Fun Aunt Rachel but I’ll go back to being Boring and Uncomfortable Aunt Rachel if that’s what you want!  Look he doesn’t have any brothers or sisters, somebody’s gonna have to teach him this stuff! And I haven’t taught him anything that a normal 6-year-old doesn’t know anyway!  Hey!  Oh I…  No! Wait! Come on!  How\\'s Ross doing? Y\\'know since all the Emily stuff.  Oh, honey, please, no, I can\\'t get started with all that Ross stuff again. I mean, he\\'s gonna screwed up for a looong time. And besides y\\'know, I don\\'t, I don\\'t go for guys right after they get divorced.  I don\\'t know! He hasn\\'t called me since that one time when we went out. I see him in the hallway, we flirt, I\\'m all ha-ha-ha-ha, and nothing.  Ohh, great!  Yeah.  That\\'s right! \\'Cause that would give him the control! So now he\\'s all ooh, coming up with this whole I\\'ve got a party thing y\\'know, trying to get me to hint around for an invitation. Blew up in his face, didn\\'t it?  No, there\\'s a party. There\\'s a party. But the power, that is still up for grabs. You follow me?  Exactly.  Oh, hi Danny.  Uh, actually, I think I\\'m gonna be busy.  Yeah! Remember I got that uh, gala.  It\\'s a uh, regatta gala.  No-no, but I support it.  Yeah, but he waited until the last minute! So if I said yes, he would know I had nothing better to do than wait around for an invitation to his stupid party. I said, \"No!\" Which puts me right back in the driver seat.  Ball? There is no ball.  Don\\'t let him in! I\\'m supposed to be at a regatta gala.  What? What kind of a regatta gala starts at night?!  Shoot, shoot, this is never gonna work! He\\'s right there!  No, I have to go downstairs and come back up as if I\\'m coming home from the regatta gala. Okay? So just go distract him. But don\\'t be sexy.  Hey! Oh right, tonight was your party.  Oh well, y\\'know, the gala had to end sometime.  Oh, come on! He\\'s glad that I came, he doesn\\'t want me to go anywhere, balls flying all over the place!  Oh, go on! You telling people about me?  No, it\\'s all right, you can just drop the act Tommy. I know what\\'s going on here. Your Danny\\'s wingman right? You guys are best buds. Frat bros!  Yeah, yeah, you go talk to your friend. You tell him, \"Nice try.\"  Man! He just keeps lobbing them up and I just keep knocking them right out of the park!  Yeah!  Hey Pheebs, can I talk to you over here for a second?  She has got so much going on we-we have only two options. We have Friday…  Yesterday!  Oh my God Phoebe, this is impossible! We can’t do this by Friday! We have to find a place. We have to invite people! We have to get food! There’s just too much to do! It’s impossible! We can’t do it! We cannot do it! We cannot do it!  Phoebe, I already, I already did.  4 o’clock. Food?  Ooh great! Very Monica.  Ah you went one too far. Uh, flowers or balloons?  We’re paying for this y’know.  Okay. Umm, what should we do for the theme?  Okay. Okay. All right, you take care of that. And meanwhile, the party is tomorrow and we still don’t have a guest list.  Hey! What’s up Mon?  Have at it.  Are you makin’ him a sandwich?  Oh my God you’re amazing! Did you just pull that out of her purse?  Yeah?  Well, I don’t know. I called all the people in Monica’s phone book and these are the only ones who could show up on 24 hours notice.  Ohhhh!  That’s great!  No I wasn’t! You were supposed to tell her to come and I was supposed to bring the cake!  Yes! And please tell her to bring a cake!  Oh Monica, we are so sorry.  Well first, for forgetting to throw you a bridal shower.  Yeah, we wanted to throw you a big surprise and a great shower, and now you don’t have either.  Ugh…  What do you, what do you mean?  Surprise…  …Monica.  Well obviously I won’t be able to come, for those of you who haven’t checked their calendars today is my due date. Well y’know, I just want to take a moment and thank you guys for how great you’ve been during this time. I really couldn’t have done it without you. And I have loved these last nine months! And even though I am so looking forward to the next part, I am really gonna miss being pregnant.  You. Like you haven’t done enough.  Do you want me to come over there and sit on you? ‘Cause I’ll do it.  They sent me home from work. They were like, \"Start your maternity leave now! Just rest, get ready for the baby.\" Well y’know what? Screw ‘em! If they don’t want me there, I’ll just hang out with you guys.  I don’t. But I would still like to be acknowledged. What? Just because I’m pregnant you think I’m invisible.  In a minute!!!  No, I’m fine.  Ross, it is 100 degrees outside. For the first time in weeks, I am somewhat comfortable.  Ross.  Can I ask you something?  When Carol was pregnant with Ben…  …were you this irritating?  Excuse me?!  Well then you just must have a natural talent for it.  Hi Dr. Long, how are you?  She has the drugs!  Yeah.  Eh, just a tad.  Well, we are ready to try anything.  Okay.  Great! We will do all of those.  Hi!  No. But she did give us some ideas on how to induce labor.  Why? Why today?  I’ll take that bet.  Well, I’m miserable here! I might as well make some money out it!  Oh honey, don’t worry. I really do feel like tomorrow’s the day.  Ross I—We tried all the spicy food. It’s not working.  I am feeling nothing. Speaking of hot, watching you do that really makes me want to have sex with you.  Oh come on Ross, why are we wasting our time with this other stuff?! We know what’s gonna work! It’s doctor recommended!  Oh come on Ross, we’ve done it before we’ll do it again, it’ll be a nice way to bookend the pregnancy.  Make love? What are you a girl?  But you will, you will be performing a service. Okay? Just-just think of me as a ketchup bottle, y’know you sometimes you have to bang on the end of it just to get something to come out.  Come on Ross! I’m miserable here! Come on! You started this, now you finish it! Come on wuss, make love to me.  What?!  Oh no. No-no! I think my water just broke.  Okay! I got the keys! Okay! Okay!  Yeah.  I didn’t uh, really have time to read this part of the books, but do you think we have time to…  Okay.  No way, forget it.  Chandler, I gotta tell you, I love your mom\\'s books! I love her books! I cannot get on a plane without one! I mean, this is so cool!  Hi! Sorry- sorry we\\'re late, we, uh, kinda just, y\\'know, lost track of time.  Mrs. Bing, I have to tell you, I\\'ve read everything you\\'ve ever written. No, I mean it! I mean, when I read Euphoria at Midnight, all I wanted to do was become a writer.  Hey.  What\\'re you guys doing out here?  Well,sounds like you two have issues.  Goodbye, baby.  Hey.  Yeah. Thought I\\'d give it a shot. I\\'m still on the first chapter. Now, do you think his \\'love stick can be liberated from its denim prison\\'?  Hey.  Okay. Now this is just the first chapter, and I want your absolute honest opinion. Oh, oh, and on page two, he\\'s not \\'reaching for her heaving beasts\\'.  Alright, alright, so I\\'m not a great typist...  Alright, that\\'s it! Give it back! That\\'s it!  No. No, you can’t.  Oh I don’t-I don’t know.  Yeah actually, I think we’re gonna take off too. We rented a movie.  Uh Pheebs, we just actually kinda wanted to be alone.  You wanna go in the bedroom? It’s a little more comfortable.  No seriously, y’know the contracts I gave you, did you overnight them?  Okay please tell me that this is just one of your jokes that you do that I don’t get.  Yes I did! And I put a little Post-It on it that said, \"Must go out today,\" and underlined today three times and, and then I put a little heart in the corner because I didn’t want to seem to bossy.  Y’know what Tag, if we went down to the office you would see those contracts sitting on your desk.  Or maybe you would see me looking embarrassed because you are talking on the phone with your crotch!  No! Come on its late, we’re not gonna go down to the office.  Puzzler. A bit of a puzzle. Why don’t you um, check the copy room, maybe you left the contracts in there?  I don’t know Tag! How can your genitals make phone calls? Okay? It’s not a perfect world! Just go please.  Oh my God! Did you check your entire desk! Did you check all the drawers!  Can I see you in my office for a minute?  You put these on my desk!  That’s a good story, Grandpa.  So, pretty much around the same time that you started telling this story.  Well, I used to date him, but you’re still going out with her!  Yeah, but she also invited you and Ross. Yeah, honey, I’m sorry, but I don’t think that was a romantic thing.  Well, that’s a lot better than Ross trying to kiss me in High School, and saying that he did it because he needed chapstick.  Okay, you look in the kitchen, I will look in the back closet.  We are looking for our Christmas presents from Monica.  Don’t worry, we’re just gonna search here for an hour, them we’re gonna go over to Joey’s and search, OK?  Chandler, aren’t you worried about what to get Monica for Christmas?  Chandler, that’s not enough. I mean what if she gets you a great present, two medium presents, and a bunch of little presents? And you’ve just gotten her one great present? I mean that’s just gonna make her feel bad. Why would you do that to her Chandler? Why? Why?  That’s right!  Oh, it’s a Macy’s bag!  We are so gonna find them this year.  Yeah.  Yeah, we found them. There were in the guest room closet behind some coats.  Well Chandler, what is this very weird, metal A Z thing?  Ha!  Yes, okay, oh, by the way, I just gotta say, I think it\\'s really nice of you that even after you\\'ve moved, you still keep storing that stuff for Joey!  Hey, this is hollow.  Oh, this one’s for me!  Ooh, let’s open them!  Whatever Linus, I’m opening mine.  Uh, wait, so you guys are telling me you actually did the routine from eighth grade?  ‘Cos I was gonna say there’s no way you could’ve done the end the way you guys did it back then!  A couple of bucks.  Phoebe, I bet somebody\\'s missing that badge.  Hey Joey!  What?! You say that to kids?!!  Ross, honey, it\\'s a nice couch. It\\'s not a magic couch.  Wait! No, that\\'s ridiculous. Come on, he lives three blocks away!  Ross!  Ross!  Come on, I don\\'t really want to be doing this right now. I am carrying a very heavy couch.  Ross!! Oh my--ugh!! You kept count?! You are such a loser!  Ross, didn\\'t you say that there was an elevator in here?  Okay, y\\'know what? There is no more left, left!  Yeah.  Oh-oh!  Any chance you think the couch looks good there?  Hey! Joey, would you mind giving me and Ross a hand moving his couch?  Thanks!  I know.  What\\'s up Joe?  Yeah?  Y\\'know honey, umm, as uh, as flattered as I am that uh, you saw me first, uhh, I just, I-I don\\'t think we should be cranking anything up.  Yeah. Yeah. Oh, but once you find it, ohh it\\'s so worth the wait.  Well, I brought the next best thing.  Wow! You certainly think a lot of yourself.  Okay!  Ross, I don\\'t, I just don\\'t think it\\'s going to fit.  I know, me neither! I mean, you had a sketch!  Hey! How\\'s it going? Did you make any new friends?  What?! Why?!  Oh my God, Phoebe, are you gonna go to jail?!  Good. Although y’know, he-he’s a private guy. Y’know, I wish I could get him to open up a little bit, share some feelings.  So what are you saying; I should run him under hot water and bang his head against a table?  Hi!  Yeah that’s great. But first, wait, talk to me, talk to me. Tell me about your day.  Okay. Hey, what are you thinking? What are you thinking right now?  No Paul, I don’t know anything about you! Y’know, like-like your childhood! Tell me about your childhood!  Okay, well then how about puberty! Come on, that’s always a painful time! Y’know your friends invite you to a slumber party and then they stick your hand in warm water while you’re sleeping so that you pee in your sleeping bag.  Well, you’re lucky you never met that bitch Sharon Majesky. Anyway, umm… The rest of you life, y’know? Any regrets?  All right Paul, I’m not asking for a lot here. Okay? Just give me something. Anything!  Okay.  All right.  Hm-mmm.  Oh!  Yeah. Yeah, I-I-I see the scare. Listen, Paul, I think this is really great that-that y’know, you shared your feelings. It’s really, it’s beautiful, but umm, what do you say we go share some food?  What?! Wait! What are you talking about?! You love their Kung Pao Chicken!  My God, I’m sorry! I’m sorry! I didn’t mean to do that! I wouldn’t do that!  Oh my God! Oh my God!!  Like a little girl. I know. I know. I know. This is all my fault; I wanted him to open up. But God, I didn’t know that I was gonna unleash this-this weepy, clingy, moist monster!  What’s the other one?  No you don’t!  Hi. I’m back.  A lover?  Oh yeah surfer?  I don’t care about the little dude! I can’t! I cannot listen to anymore of this! Y’know, the only person who would want to listen to this is a mental health professional! And then it’s only because they get paid $100 an hour! Do you know how much money I could’ve made listening to you? $2,000! And do you know when I figured that out? While you were talking!  Oh… I’m sorry. I… I-I don’t mean—I didn’t mean to stifle you. I… This is all just a little overwhelming.  Wow.  Noo, that’s our unbelievably loud upstairs neighbor.  Good luck.  I know!  Op.  Oh, you got me.  Oh, that sounds great.  Oh thank you so much Mr. Kaplan, thank you so much.  Oh God, I hate my job, I hate it, I hate my job, I hate it.  Oh, I wanna quit, but then I think I should stick it out, then I think why would such a person stay in such a demeaning job, just because it’s remotely related to the field they’re interested in.  Oh honey, come on, I’m sorry, I didn’t.... I don’t mind paying my dues, y\\'know, its just how much am I gonna learn about fashion by walking Mira, the arthritic seamstress, to the bathroom.  It’s not funny, this is actually my job.  Oh well then, so I’m just going to go back to talking to my friend here. And you can go back to enjoying your little hamburger.  Yes?!  Hi! So I’m out having lunch at Monica’s and this guy starts talking to me, and it turns out he works for a buyer at Bloomingdale’s and there happens to be an opening in his department. So I gave him my phone number and he’s gonna call me this weekend to see if he can get me an interview!  I know!  Uh-huh!  Yeah! His name is um, Mark something.  What!?  To be nice.  I didn’t have to, because I was wearing my ‘I heart Ross’ sandwich board and ringing my bell.  Well, I assume I’ll have to take showers with him, but y\\'know, that’s true of any job.  I mean that’s unbelievable.  Dark, big hair, with the airplane earrings.  That’s all right.  Did he call? Did Mark call?  Music. Very nice.  So, how are you?  Oh yeah, what’s it about?  I can’t believe Mark didn’t call. It’s Sunday night, and he didn’t call.  Yeah, and you don’t mind if I call, because you only want good things for me.  He even offered to meet me for lunch tomorrow to prep me for it.  I got to figure out what I’m going to wear.  What are you doing here?  Oh.  Hi.  Oh well, the woman I interviewed with was pretty tough, but y\\'know thank God Mark coached me, because once I started talking about the fall line, she got all happy and wouldn’t shut up.  Me too!  I know.  Yeah.  Oh, I did!  Eavesdropping. Pheebs, the ceiling tiles were falling down.  Honey, I’m sorry.  How does going to a strip club help him better?  Yeah!  Yeah! Okay, two larges coming right up!  Yes.  Sure. You got it. Great!  Ohh! Right! Right, sorry, I’ll be right back!  Oh.  No! Nothing!  Yeah! That would be great!  Yeah, great, you betcha!  What?  Oh. Oh, right.  Oh yay!  Hey, Monica!  Ohh, it’s Joshua invited me to this fancy club opening tonight. But, I already told Mr. Waltham that I would take his niece to this dumb old opera. So… What are you gonna do?  No! Help me!  Phoebe?  Ugh!  Ohh, gosh. You guys, come on, this is—I have to meet Joshua! This is my one chance for him to see the fun Rachel. Y’know the \"Wouldn’t it be great if she was my wife\" Rachel. Ohh, all right! Are Joey and Chandler back?  So….  Ohhhh, come on!!!  No! Wait! Wait-wait! Ross, please!  I’m Rachel Green.  There’s been a teeny-teeny change in plans. It turns out that I’m not free tonight. So…  Oh well, no I…  I’ll get her.  Well, I didn’t see Joshua last night, but I did punch a girl in the face.  The whole night was horrible, it was pouring down rain, and when I got there, there was no Rachel Green on the list, but there was a Rachel Greep.  No, there is no Rachel Greep, but then this other girl overheard us and she was all, \"I’m Rachel Greep! I’m Rachel Greep!\" and he let her right in.  No, she was already in, but then this big bitch behind me tried to steal my umbrella, so I clocked her. Ohhh! I can’t believe this, all I wanted was a few hours outside of work to see Joshua, so he can go ahead and start falling in love with me.  Honey, that’s you’re name.  I don’t care! All right, y’know what I’m just upset that I’m getting nowhere with Joshua that—y’know what still, you do not meet someone and go flitting off to Vermont!  It’s Joshua.  No, I don’t.  See, I don’t know, for me it would have to Chantal.  Oh my goodness, she had the smoothest skin! I mean when I stuck that dollar bill in her g-string and grazed her thigh…  Well, are we all together? Like in a group?  Oh, hey!  What?  Oh, hmm.  Joshua.  Yeah, I…  Oh, thank goodness!  No-no-no, that’ not Joshua.  Oh Monica that was the best Thanksgiving dinner ever! I think you killed us.  Yeah, you know what we should all do? We should play that game where everyone says one thing that they\\'re thankful for.  Oh, you\\'re not gonna tell the whole story about how your parents got divorced again are you?  I know Monica\\'s worst Thanksgiving.  What?! Joey got a turkey stuck on his head?!  Actually, y\\'know that\\'s not the Thanksgiving I was talking about.  No, it wasn\\'t. It was actually the…  Oh, yeah, I had too. There was never any parking by the Psychology building.  Oh hi!  Hey!  What?!  Okay, that we may be able to do.  Well guys tend to get naked before they\\'re gonna have sex.  Okay, first of all, if you keep calling it that, no one\\'s gonna ever take it. Then, second of all you\\'re not actually gonna have sex with him! You\\'re just gonna make him think that you are.  Yeah.  Then, you will definitely get him back!  Okay, oh, here\\'s what you do. Just act like everything around you turns you on.  You brought a carrot?!  So if you think I didn\\'t say goodbye to you because you don\\'t mean as much to me as everybody else, you\\'re wrong. It\\'s because you mean more to me.  What?!  Shh.. Go back to sleep. I have to go home.  It really was. You\\'ve learned some new moves!  Ah.  I know!  Morning!  Hey.  Good. You?  Chick and the duck? Didn\\'t they die...  You too. Last night was just wonderful.  I woke up today with the biggest smile on my face.  Hi!  Hi! So I just dropped Emma off at my mom\\'s.  No, we decided that I would go ahead and set up first, and then my mom would bring Emma to Paris on Sunday.  Are you kidding? Eight hours with my mother talking about Atkins? Good luck, Emma!  Yeah?  Oh... Bye guys.  Hi! You guys, the car-service just got here. I can\\'t believe they\\'re not home yet! I have to catch my stupid plane. I wanna see the baby!  Oh my God!  Hi! Oh my gosh!  Oh.  What... What...  Aw..  Oh my gosh. Wow, so beautiful.  Oh, you guys, I can\\'t believe this. But I\\'ll leave now, or I\\'m gonna miss my plane.  Me too. Oh, I\\'m just sorry I\\'m not gonna be around to watch you two attempt to handle this! Alright, I can\\'t say goodbye to you guys again. I love you all so much.  I will. Ross, come here.  I just want you to know.. Last night.. I\\'ll never forget it.  Alright, now I really have to go. Okay. Au revoir! Oh, they\\'re gonna really hate me over there.  Oh my God! I was so afraid I wasn\\'t gonna remember any of my high-school French, but I understood every word you just said!  Oh.  Oh, shoot. I had it. Oh, I can\\'t believe this.  I have it, I have it, I have it. Oh, okay, I can\\'t find it, but I remember that I was in seat 32C, because that\\'s my bra-size.  Okay, fine! But you know what? If I was in 36D, we would not be having this problem.  Oh! Shoot! Damn it! Where is it? Oh! Oh! I found it! I found it!  Hah! I found it! I told you I would find it! In your face! You\\'re a different person.  Hello?  Yeah.  Phoebe? Is everything okay?  What? Why?  Oh, honey, I\\'m sure there\\'s nothing wrong with the plane.  Alright, look, I have to go. I love you, and I will call you the minute I get to Paris.  Oh, that was just my crazy friend. She told me I should get off the plane, because she had a feeling that there was something wrong with the left Philange.  I wouldn\\'t worry about it. She\\'s always coming up with stuff like this, and you know what? She\\'s almost never right.  Well...  Wait, what are you doing?  Could I get some peanuts?  This is ridiculous! I...  Yeah, okay.  Oh my God... What.. What are you guys doing here?  What? What? Ross, you\\'re scaring me. What\\'s going on?  Yeah?  What?  Oh my God.  I - I have to get on the plane.  Yes, I do.  They\\'re waiting for me, Ross. I can\\'t do this right now, I\\'m sorry. I\\'m sorry.  I\\'m so sorry.  I got off the plane.  I do love you.  Okay. \\'Cause this is where I wanna be, okay? No more messing around. I don\\'t wanna mess this up again.  Okay. You and me, alright? This is it.  I know. It seems smaller somehow.  Okay, should we get some coffee?  Honey, what are you doing? That’s too heavy.  Is that the heartbeat?  Oh wow! This is so cool.  Well, so, are-are you sure that there are three?!  What’s that song? It has been in my head all day long.  Y’know who doesn’t even like dirty movies? My new boyfriend Joshua.  No, he told me. He prefers to leave certain things to the imagination.  Yes!  Hey!  Well, so, why don’t you just turn it off?  Well, what-what ‘cha got there?  Honey, you’re not gonna make enough money to help Frank and Alice just by selling knives.  Hey!  Well, we were walking down the street and we saw that van that you guys used for catering and we realised…  Okay.  Well, well I can up with it!  Well, I…  Okay, it’s not Relaxi Cab. It’s Relaxicab, like taxicab.  Well since I’m movin’ out and-and you’re so beautiful…  …how about I move in with you?  You have a roommate?!  Oh, that’s true.  Yeah, yeah I think I’m gonna find my own place.  Pheebs, I have to ask you…  You’re just staring into space.  Hey.  Yeah! Why?  That sounds great! I’d love to live at Warren’s!! I love Warren! Thank you!  What?!  Oh my God! Are you serious?!  I would love to live with you Ross; that’s-that’s great! Thank you!  Ross-Ross, you have no idea what this means to me! I mean, I mean I was gonna be homeless. You just saved me! You’re my hero!  Hey!  Oh thanks, but listen, I was just at Monica’s and she and Chandler had a big fight and they’re not moving in.  No-no, they just had a big blowout over what to do with my room.  Yeah, I feel kinda bad for them, but I’m also really psyched ‘cause I don’t have to move in here!  No-no, I’m staying put.  Why, where are you going?  Hi!  Oh wow.  Yeah. Y’know umm, uh, umm, about that, umm, Ross I really appreciate your offer to let me move in and everything, but don’t you think it’s gonna be weird?  Well, because of us! Because of our history.  No?  No! Not at all!  Okay, but Ross, eventually you and I are gonna be dating.  Yeah! I’m gonna have a boyfriend, you’re gonna have a girlfriend…  Umm, well let’s see Monica and Chandler are occupied.  No, the other thing. I really think it’s great they work things out.  Hey, can I borrow the key to your house so I can run across the street and make a copy?  All right, well the place was closed. I’ll just copy it later.  Well, it would be easier to move just right across the hall. Wait a minute, unless you’re thinking about Naked Wednesday’s.  What?  Oh yeah, I know, but the garbage was full.  Right!  Oh! Hey, Mr. Treeger.  I’m sorry. I didn’t—I don’t come in here a lot.  No.  I didn’t… I never said that.  Yes! And he said really mean things that were only partly true.  That’s easy for you to say, you weren’t almost just killed.  Oh Pheebs, is that a new ankle bracelet?  Oh! My hero! What happened?  What?! You got us evicted!!  Go!!  Well, why doesn’t he practice with a girl?  Hey! So, did you quit?  Oh, umm, I was just y’know working out and umm… Oh, that’s it.  Where?!  You just did a little dancy thing.  You are soo enjoying this.  Ooh, this is soo sweet, Joey our little twinkle-toes.  What are you ever gonna use that for?!  You got fired?!  Sweety...  I don’t know. Do-do you have any clothes on?  Really?!  Oh! I remember laughing! I laughed a lot.  Ohh, I mean, we were really drunk. I’m just glad we didn’t do anything stupid.  No, we didn’t get married! That’s ridiculous!  Oh my God.  No!  Hey, hubby!  Uh-huh.  Okay! So, we’ll just stay married.  And I will make everyone call me Mrs. Geller!  Okay, see now I’m scared because I don’t actually think you’re kidding.  What-wh-what so we’ll just stay married forever?!  Ohh, okay, I’m sorry. You’re right. Y’know what? We absolutely can stay married, because I was under the impression that the boxes were far away from each other. All right, look, just please, take a moment here and think about what you’re asking of me.  You are asking me to be your wife!  Hey!  Oh b-b-but it is!  Oh Ross, come on! This is not, this is not a marriage!! This is the world’s worst hangover! Ross, listen, if you do not get this annulment, I will!  Huh, that’s funny. You look like you’re gonna be the…  Hey, so did everything go all right with the annulment?  Ross, thank you. Hey, do you guys wanna go see a movie?  Pheebs?  Oh Ross, come on! You just did what you had to do.  Well, yeah! We\\'re cool. Totally cool.  Oh no, you\\'re the best.  What?! I didn\\'t have a good time in Greece! Ross abandoned me! Okay, I couldn\\'t get a plane out, so I had to stay in their honeymoon suite with people coming up to me all the time going, \"Oh, Mrs. Geller, why are you crying?\" I mean, it was sooo humiliating. I felt like such an idiot! I mean, it\\'s all my fault! And you know why, because I make very bad decisions.  Yes it is! It is true! I went, I went after Ross in stupid London.  Phoebe, you were right. I should\\'ve never gone to London, and from now on you make all of my decisions for me.  That\\'s fine. So Monica, you are now in control of my love life.  …I mean it\\'s my fault.  Yeah, I guess Gunther is kinda…  Oh, I don\\'t know. I don\\'t know.  All right, you\\'re the boss. I guess I gotta do what you tell me.  Hey!  Well, y\\'know, a little of this, a little of that. Got myself a date tomorrow night.  Well…  That\\'s not European!  Oh God, I really had a good time!  Yeah. Umm, unless you wanna come inside?  Okay. Oh, uh, wait a minute, y\\'know what? I uh, I can\\'t decide this. Umm, okay, just hold on a second.  Umm, hi!  Is Monica around? I-I have to ask her something.  Oh, honey that\\'s awful.  But, it\\'s not raining.  Ohh! You did not drop any socks!  Well, ultimately, I was trying y\\'know, I-I wanted…tell him y\\'know, that I\\'m still in love with him.  Why? Why not?! People love to hear that!  Well, y\\'know what, no, you do not make my decisions because y\\'know what, you\\'re fired.  No.  Well, then talk!  Yes!  I\\'m gonna do it.  But I…  All right, fine.  Phoebe, woo!  Yeah, y\\'know what? I\\'m-I\\'m gonna meet you upstairs in a minute.  Well, y\\'know what, that doesn\\'t matter.  Yeah, I-I don\\'t care.  What \\'cha readin\\'?  Yeah, what\\'s it about?  Okay. Uhh, Ross, y\\'know what, there\\'s something that I-that I have to talk to you about and everybody\\'s saying that I shouldn\\'t tell you, but I think they\\'re wrong. I mean, and you know how people can be wrong.  Okay, Ross, I\\'m really trying to tell you something here.  Okay.  Oh God, ohh, okay, y\\'know what, do you think ah, do you think that you just forget that I told you this?  The thing is y\\'know, that you\\'re married to Emily.  Ross, things aren\\'t gonna be weird between us, right? I mean was that just the stupidest thing, me telling you that?  Hey, you guys! Guess what? Barry and Mindy are getting a divorce!  Barry was the guy that I was almost married and Mindy was my best friend.  Yeah, but that just means that he was falling asleep on top of her instead of me.  Merrill Lynch?  Well why didn’t you take the job?  Oh, I’m sorry. Ross Tillman.  Ohh, of course Monica’s brother!  Wow! How are you?!  Ohh! Me too!  Ohh, I would love too.  Ohh! Okay!  But! Don’t you have to give him his money back?  Oh yeah.  Oh yeah. Right. So now, are—do you, do you still do music?  He’s coming over! He’s coming over!  Ah!  Wow! This is so amazing! What else? What else?  Hey!  That’s a line from the show too!  Yeah sure, iced tea would be great.  Oh Mon, listen I have to ask! Okay, Joey Tribbiani invited me back to his apartment, now does he do this with a lot of girls?  Ohh! And I’m one of them!! Wow! Oh, I just cannot believe this! I mean, Joey Tribbiani!  Yeah. Oh I just wish we could not be married for a little bit! Y’know I just wish we could be like on a break!

Honey, you’ve waited long enough!!  Yes!! I mean sex does not have to be a big deal! There shouldn’t be all this rules and restrictions! Y’know, people should be able to sleep with who ever they want, whenever…  Oh what do you know? Virgin!  Ohh, I mean it’s just so realistic!  Umm, can I use your bathroom?  Yeah, it sure is!  Yeah?  Wow! I can’t, I can’t feel my hands.  Noo! Oh God we did—we didn’t, we didn’t uhh…  God I’m just a horrible person.  Because I’m married. That’s right, I am a married woman! And I came to a TV star’s apartment to have an affair! Uck!  Yeah and I’m a horrible, horrible person.  The ring from the cave, yeah.  No! No-no-no…  But I thought that ring stood for Caprice’s undying love for her brother.  Yeah!  Ohh! My God! Barry!!  Oh that’s right! I’m sorry! I-I am early! Finish! Please!!  Hi Ross!  Is Joey Tribbiani here?  Well, if you see him, will you please tell him that I’m looking for him and that this I am not gonna throw up!  Me? I’m great! I’m fine! I’m sooo good!! But, you know who’s not great?! Men! You’re a man right Ross?!  Sit down!  Let me uh, let me ask you something, do wedding vows mean squat to you people?! And why is it that the second we tell you we’re going out of town, bamn there you are in bed with the neighbor’s dog walker?!  No seriously! Seriously! What has happened to the sanctity of marriage?  Aw what are you?! A detective?  Who are these men?  Good day for married people huh?  I’m sorry your wife is gay. I guess women aren’t that great either.  Well, Joshua’s coming in tomorrow and since I don’t have the guts to ask him out, I’m going to sell him a coat and put this note in the pocket.  Oh, here’s that trench-coat that you wanted.  Yeah?  I know!  Oh?  Well, congratulations, so do you love her?  Oh, it’s just an anti-theft device.  Oops, sorry. Listen, we-we have to have a party tonight! Actually, we have to have one in five minutes, so everybody cancel your plans.  Surprise!!!  Well, it was all Ross’s idea.  Uhh, because I’m trying to play hard to get. Oh, quick he’s looking over here, say something funny.  Care for a cherry?  No? Y’know, I can tie one of these into a knot using just my tongue.  Oh, could somebody give me a hand with this zipper?  Up!  Yeah, I did. I needed my lucky dress.  Ohh, God! Look at him, he’s so cute. I wanna go over there, grab him, and kiss him! How can I kiss him and not letting him know that I like him?  What?  It’s not Christmas!  He’s not 11!  What? You’re leaving?!  No! You guys can’t leave yet! You have to stay, we-we got the whole big thing planned!  Yay! Emily!  Okay, my turn!!  It’s okay! It’s okay! It kicked once, it’ll kick again!  All right, well, everybody just remember where they were sitting.  Just a bug.  No-n-n-n-no! I am finally thinking clearly. My lucky dress wasn’t working out to well for me, but for four years, this baby never missed.  Hi!  Gimme an ‘M!’  Gimme an ‘I!’  Gimme an ‘L!’  Gimme a ‘Y!’  All right, come on, let’s go get your coat.  Oh no-no-no! No, I got this all under control.  Well, I’m sorry, I thought you needed them!  Why?!  You like me?  Yeah but-but-but you liked me! Oh my God, I can’t believe this, all this time, I liked you and you liked me!  Oh no-no-no don’t say but! No-no, but’s never good! Let’s just leave it at, you like me and I like you.  Oh, now see that’s a fancy but.  But….  Okay.  Ohh, here you are. I was looking for you before. Joshua’s gone so you and Emily are free to go.  Oh, Ross, I’m sorry. I completely ruined your evening.  Well, if it makes you feel any better, I made a fool out of myself.  Is there room on that step for a pathetic loser?  I’m so sorry.  Well, maybe you didn’t want it to end?  You seem to really like her.  Ross, that girl just spent the entire evening talking to your friends, asking to hear stories about you, looking through Monica’s photo albums, I mean you don’t do that if you’re just in it for two weeks.  Yeah, you got like 14 hours until she has to be at the airport, and you’re sitting here in the hallway with a 28-year-old cheerleader with a fat lip.  Yeah.  I don’t know, it was you and a bunch of albino kids.  Hey.  You’re a pathetic loser, right?  Sit!  Oh my gosh, Joshua!  They’re not true?  Oh.  Oh! Oh, I love that but.  You wanna go inside and have some coffee?  Yeah, what?  Yeah-yeah, did-didn’t you use to have a pair? They were really round, burgundy, and they made you look kind of umm…  Yes!  Oh, y’know what you should get ‘em? One of those little uh, portable CD players.  Yeah, and-and-and by someone, she means Joey.  Y’know Joey, I could teach you to sail if you want.  Yeah! I’ve been sailing my whole life. When I was fifteen my dad bought me my own boat.  What?! What?! He was trying to cheer me up! My pony was sick.  That is the Coast Guard.  Joey, just ignore the boats all right? We’re not finished with the lesson yet.  Okay, I’m just gonna go over the basic points just one more time, are you ready?  Wrong! How do you get the mainsail up?  No. What do you do if I say we are coming about?  Time’s up, now your dead.  Don’t just say yes! This isn’t a game, Joey you can really get hurt out here. Okay, so do you want to pay attention or do you want to die?!  I don’t know. Y’know, they didn’t get us anything.  Well hello! So, when are we gettin’ back out on the water matey?  Why not?  What? I was just trying to teach you.  Excuse me, I wanted you to help, but you couldn’t move your arms because you were wearing three life jackets.  Look Joey, I’m sorry if-if you thought that was mean, but I gotta tell ya something. That was not mean. Okay, my father is mean. He used to yell at me all the time on the boat, I mean it was horrible. I was just being a good teacher.  Well, does a good student drink seven beers during his first lesson?  Yeah, I didn’t want you to get hit by the boom!  All right, y’know what? I-I’m sorry. I will try to tone it down and uh stop yelling.  I won’t boss you around.  And, I’ll be nice.  And—Joey!  Right?  It’s left sweetie, but that’s okay sweetie, that’s a tough one.  No! No-no, no-no-no, very quiet, said with love, no yelling.  What do you mean you quit?! You can’t quit!  Because you’re not finished yet and I won’t have it! Greens do not quit!  No! No! No! I’m not yelling at you, I’m just yelling near you. Oh God Joey, ohh I’m my father. Oh my God, this is horrible! I’ve been trying so hard not to be my mother I did not see this comin’. Oh, Joey, I’m sorry. I’m so sorry. I just wanted you to learn.  Really?  Awww…  Left.  Well Joey, I hate to admit it, your way of sailing is a lot more fun.  Ohh we’re not sailing.  Ohh, sorry.  Ohh whoops.  Hi!  My God!  Congratulations! Wow!!  Mmh-mmh!  Oh, Pheebs, baby, that\\'s nice but, you know what, I think I\\'m ok. Why don\\'t you give it to one of your other single girlfriends?  Oh!  Phoebe, isn\\'t Jethro Tull a band?  Hi!  I\\'m sorry, this sounds like something I\\'m never gonna be interested in.  Just tell Joey that you watched the tape and you liked it, but your bosses didn\\'t. Then that way, you\\'re the good guy and they\\'re the bad guys.  Who\\'s Gladys?  Well, I mean, sure, of course. But... you already gave that to Monica, so...  No, I couldn\\'t let you do that.  But I don\\'t want you to.  But I insist harder!  Did you watch the tape?  But you are a liar.  O-oh my God!  Joey, what... is... this...thing... doing here?  Joey, we\\'re not keeping this!  Alright, fine. You can keep it. As long as you don\\'t mind that she\\'s haunted.  Well, legend has it Joey, that... she comes alive when you\\'re asleep.  She\\'s yours!  She\\'s yours!  She\\'s mine!  She\\'s mine!  I want Gladys!  She\\'s mine!  She\\'s mine!  Excellent!  Ha ha ha, third time this week. Man, this does not get old.  Oh, don\\'t be such a baby!  That’s nice.  Well that was umm…Okay.  Ohh no you don’t! You got lighting last time, lighting is mine!  What are you gonna do Pheebs?  Joey! Kinda in the middle of a story here!  Okay, so anyway I’m sittin’ in my office and guess who walks in.  Joey!  It’s the same story.  Yeah!  I got—I get a big pay raise!  I get to hire my own assistant!  Okay, well this is all very impressive Hilda, um I just have one last question for you. Uh, how did I do? Was this okay?  I’ve never interviewed anyone before. I’ve actually never had anyone work for me before. Although when I was a kid, we did have a maid, but this is-this isn’t the same thing.  No. Yeah, and I know that. All right, well thank you so much for coming in it was nice to meet you.  Uh-huh, go on.  Oh come on, what are you talking about? You’ve got three years painting houses. Two whole summers at T.G.I. Friday’s, come on!  Chandler, you have an assistant right?  No, I-I just don’t know how you decide who to hire. I mean I’ve got it narrowed down to two people. One of them has great references and a lot of experience and then there’s this guy…  I love him. He’s so pretty I wanna cry! I don’t know what to do. Tell me what to do.  Okay you’re right. I’ll hire Hilda tomorrow. Dumb old perfect for the job Hilda!  Hi! Tag. What are you doing here?  Kinda.  Oh-ohh, thank you.  Well…  But I hired you!  Yeah! You-you got the job! You’re my new assistant!  Yeah!  Me either. Umm, all right, first thing I need you to do is go downstairs and find a women named Hilda and tell her to go home.  Hi!  Ohh, my new assistant is working out, yes.  Oh, my-my new assistant has very happy that I hired my new assistant.  I’m sorry Joey.  Well wait a minute, what happened to Days of Our Lives?  Joey, why would you do that?  All right I know, I know how it looks Pheebs, but I’m telling you…  Hi!  Well yeah, sure, what’s up?  Oh really?!  Oh, did you not want people to know that?  Why’s that?  ‘Kay.  Yeah.  Listen y’know what sir? For the last time, I don’t care what the computer says, we did not take a bag of Mashuga nuts from the mini-bar and we did not watch Dr. Do-Me-A-Little!  Yeah, one time, when we were dating, uh we got a late checkout, he got so excited it was the best sex we ever had. Until y’know, he screamed out Radisson at the end.  Shh-shh-shh! The guys don’t know yet do they?  Don’t worry I promise that you will only have to be pregnant for a few more hours, ‘cause I’m going to tell the father today.  Ew! No!  Well then you have his baby.  Yeah. Uh-huh, I guess it is pretty big news.  Well it’s only different if he wants it to be. I mean, I’m not gonna ask him for anything.  Hey Joey, what would you do if someone that you slept with told you that she was pregnant?  Oh Joey! Joey! No, it’s not you! You didn’t get anybody pregnant!  Not yet.  No! Phoebe, it’s not Gunther.  Phoebe the father is not here okay? I haven’t told him yet and I don’t think I can tell him at all now!  I don’t know, let me think. I was walking down the street thinking, ‘I’m gonna tell the father today’ and then bam!  No, you! Phoebe you freaked me out. You kept saying how huge this all is!  I know, but I was just thinking about how huge this is for me. I didn’t even go to how huge this was going to be for the father.  What? Hey wait a minute! Phoebe, how do you even know who the father is?  Oh God… Oh, he’s in there right now?  Uh, let’s rip!  Oh Phoebe!  Nothing! Phoebe kinda made a mistake. But y’know you do wear that sweater a lot, are you involved in some kind of dare?  Oh, it’s just not the right time.  Okay.  Tag…  I’m having a baby.  You can go.  Tag is not the father! And Joey knows now?  Oh wow, you didn’t even try to unhook my bra!  No, I will. I’m just not up for it tonight.  I’m not?  What?  No! Joey, oh you’re so sweet. You’re so-so sweet, honey. But I’m not, I’m not looking for a husband.  Well, believe me, it’s been a long time since I’ve been flung.  Yeah! Wait a minute, it’s been a long time that I’ve been single. How come you never offered this before?  Okay! No accountants. Oh, and no one from like legal. I don’t like guys with boring jobs.  Well, wait a minute, you’re the boss! Why don’t you just yell at them? Or, fire them?  Pheebs, that’s great!  But y’know umm, Rachel doesn’t rhyme with draddle.  Oh yeah!  Really?!  So, will I like any of these guys?  Chandler!  Ohh, I like swimmer’s bodies!  Op, I like credit cards!  Well, so what does he do?  Your company has a fine foods division?  Patrick and I had such a great time last night! I mean I think this could maybe turn into something serious.  You told this guy that I was looking for a fling?! You don’t tell the guy that!  Oh, between you telling him that I wanted to have a fling and me putting out on the first date—oh, he’s so gonna get the wrong idea.  Chandler! Patrick just uh, ended things with me. Did you or did you not tell him that I was looking for a serious relationship?  You idiot!!  You don’t tell a guy that you’re looking for a serious relationship! You don’t tell the guy that! Now you scared him away!  Y’know, you should never be allowed to talk to people!  Really?  No.  Cute guys in little shorts? Sure.  What?! Chandler, what is the matter with you?!  Ooooh! Wow!! Oh, hi.  How come you didn\\'t come over earlier?  Yeah, I just have to get dressed.  Yeah! Once, I figure out what I\\'m wearing.  Uh, no. Wait, you know what, this is the outfit that makes my calves look fat. Nevermind.  Ooooh! Honey, well we\\'ll find you something. Do you wanna wear my black jacket?  No, you\\'re right. Well, we\\'ll find something. Let\\'s just get you out of that. Come on.  Monica, can Phoebe borrow your green dress?  Pheebs, you go with Monica and try on her green dress. If that doesn\\'t work, you can wear my gray silk one. Oh, gosh, what am I wearing?!  Well, hon-ey. I\\'m just trying to look nice for your big night.  Ross, that was a Halloween costume, unless you would like me to go to this thing as Little Bo Peep.  Yeah, which, by the way Chandler, I would like back one of these days.  Oh, it\\'s perfect! But not for tonight.  No honey, we\\'re sorry, we didn\\'t mean it. I love you. I love you.  Yeahh, but, but those really go better with pants. Maybe I should wear pants?  But I...  All right.  I\\'m not gonna gooo.  No, I think I\\'m gonna catch up on my correspondence.  I\\'m not gonna gooo, so I think that will accomplish the not going.  Well, ever since I was humiliated and yelled at in front of my friends, I\\'m just, I don\\'t know, not in a museum benefitty kind of mood.  It\\'s fine.  I\\'m not mad.  I\\'m just not going.  Right.  Um, hum.  No.  Right.  Right, and the humiliating.  Um, hum.  Right.  No, no, no, now wait, wa, wa, waa-it a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute. That actually, uh, that sounds interesting.  I think you should drink the fat.  No, no, no, wait! Okay, okay. Don\\'t! I\\'ll go, I\\'ll go!  You were really gonna do that, weren\\'t you?  You were gonna drink the fat.  I\\'m going commando, too.  Well and clearly not a minute sooner.  Of course I packed! Monica relax! I just wanted to ask Phoebe her opinion on what I should wear tonight.  Yeah, yeah, I know.  Surprise!!  No, no don’t get mad because look—this is what happened. So I-I started packing, then I realized, \"What am I doing? I am lousy at packing!\" Right? But you love packing! So, as a gift to you, on our last night, ta-da!  Ohhhhhh, look it’s the roller blades.  You remember when we got these?  I’m sorry Pheebs, I guess I’m just really said that I’m leaving.  I have one.  You get your messages!  So-so, you missed a message from who? Chandler or your mom? Or Chandler? Or your mom?  Ooh, your brother. Score!  You know what else I’m not gonna miss? \"I’m Monica. I wash the toilet 17 times a day. Even if people are on it!\"  \"I’m Monica, I don’t get phone messages from interesting people. Ever!\"  \"Oh my God, I can’t find a boyfriend! So I guess I’ll just stumble across the hall and sleep with the first guy I find in there!\"  I’m unpacking!  Hey, y’know what? You’re the one who wants to make this big change and move in with Chandler! You should be the one to go! Why should I have to leave?!  Well it’s mine too! What else you got?!  Great! Monica’s moving!  Yeah, I’m just mad!  Funny, because I was just gonna go across the hall and write that on Chandler.  Well, Phoebe that’s fine because I’m not moving.  Oh really? Like what Monica?  Oh yeah, good start Mon.  Yeah and you stretch ‘em out with your big old clown feet.  Yeah, I do. I-I do, do that.  Well y’know, I don’t want you to be cold.  Oh, it’s gonna be fine.  But honey, I think she’s moving in with Chandler.  Okay.  Yeah.  Bye house!  Bye Mon.  Yeah? Well, you should know. You’ve bought like a billion of ‘em.  Ohh…  Are any of you guys free tonight? My boss is hosting this charity event for underprivileged kids and the more people I bring, the better I look. So, Monica? Chandler?  Oh my God, I’m so sorry.  I think so.  Hey! Ross, listen can you come to a charity event tonight?  See? Now, he could date her.  Oh! Thank you!  Uh well, uh this is a silent auction. They lay out all the stuff here and then you write down your offer and then the highest bid gets it.  Oh, hi!  And I also brought my friend Joey…  Well, y’know I-I don’t know where he is.  Well, y’know what? Actually, I was about to bid on this lovely trip to Paris.  Yeah.  Ugh! So close!  What are you doing?  Well now it’s an empty bar.  What?! What?! What?!  Joey! It is an auction! You don’t guess, you buy!  What were you thinking?!  Wh?!  Why would a charity give away a free boat?!  Ugh!  Phoebe, don’t you think you’ve had enough to drink?  How is you drinking helping the kids?  Okay.  Not great.  Oh great!  Oh well, hello. This is your lucky day Mr. Bowmont, the uh gentleman day sailer as just become available again and I believe that you made a bid of $18,000.  Ohh…  Y-Yeah! What-what is your wife’s name?  Pam! Oh God okay, just imagine this, \"The Pam.\"  Okay, uh-uh imagine this, \"The Mr. Bowmont.\"  But Joey you don’t have $20,000!  Isn’t it incredible?! Monica and Chandler, gettin’ married.  Ohh… I mean two best friends falling in love, how often does that happen?  No! I’m so happy for them!  I’m so happy and not at all jealous.  I mean I’m probably 98% happy, maybe 2% jealous. And I mean what’s 2%? That’s nothing.  Yeah me too.  We’re gonna find love!  Yeah, I’m pretty confident about that. That’s what makes it so easy for me to be 80% happy for Monica and Chandler! It would be nice to have a little guarantee though.  Well y’know, some people make deals with a friend, like if neither of them are married by the time they’re 40, they marry each other.  Exactly!  You do?  Who?  Joey?!  Are you serious?!  Wh… So… If neither of you are married by the time you’re 40, you’re gonna marry Joey.  Oh, seriously?  Charming.  Yeah.  Hey you!  Oh thank you. Hey y’know, I’m so sorry to hear about you and Elizabeth.  Yeah, love. It’s a tricky business isn’t it?  So what do you say we make a pact? If you and I are both single by the time we’re 40, we get married. I mean, we know each other, we like each other, and we’ve-we’ve already slept together so y’know there’ll be no surprises there! You know what I mean? No like, \"What’s that?!\"  Exactly.  What? Who?  Phoebe?! Wait a—but-but she just, she said that Joey was her backup.  Ross! I just had a conversation with her, and she said that she and Joey made a deal!  Phoebe! You picked Joey and Ross?! You can not have two backups!  What?!  Phoebe you can’t have both of them! You have to pick one!  Oh God, Phoebe!  Oh.  Pick one.  You’re welcome.  Ohhh, this is the least jealous I’ve ever been!  Oh hell, he’s done this three times! He knows what its about!  That is it! You just barge in here, you don\\'t knock  You have no respect for anybody\\'s privacy!  No, you wait! This is ridiculous!  What? What?!  Oh!!  He\\'s so cute! And he seems to like you so much.  No, I\\'m sorry, we\\'re all out of those. Anybody else?  Okay, okay, could we change the subject, please?  Okay, Pheebs, I was hoping for more of a change.  Nice? They were nice. I mean, that\\'s it? I mean, mittens are nice.  Did you not get a good enough look the other day?  C\\'mon, he\\'s right. Tit for tat.  You\\'re right! I mean you\\'re right! It wasn\\'t just the Weebles, but it was the Weeble Play Palace, and and the Weebles\\' Cruise Ship. Oh, which had this little lifeboat for the Weebles to wobble in.  Hi, I\\'m Rachel.  Bathroom\\'s up there.  Hey, listen, Ronni, how long would you say Chandler\\'s been in the shower?  Chandler Bing? It\\'s time to see your thing.  I thought it was Chandler!  You were supposed to be in there so I could see your thing!  We hate that guy.  We\\'re sorry.  Wow.  Just think, in a couple of years we get to turn into them.  What happened?  Thanks for dinner.  So.  I say ‘cheesy line’, but ok.  I am sorry, I don’t know, I am sorry, I don’t know why I did that!  Ok, so sorry.  I am sorry! Again... I don\\'t know, I don’t know what happened, I must be nervous!  Ok, ok, ok. I promise, I promise, I promise, I won’t do it again. I really do. I promise. This is gonna be great.  Absolutely! Absolutely. I d... it’s just a little weird, it’s you, and it’s me, it\\'s just gonna take some getting used to.  Okay.  Oh!  Ow!  Well this is romantic!  It’s a standard issue bra clasp!  Ok well, well I\\'m really, I\\'m sorry about that Joey, but do you think that maybe on some level, you don\\'t want to take off my bra?  oh oh! What is up with Miss Hawaiian Tropic?  Well, it was good.. until we got back to our apartment, and then we were fooling around and he started to put his hand up my leg and I kept slapping it away!  Well, it wasn\\'t just me, alright? He freaked out too! He couldn\\'t even undo my bra!  I do not know what\\'s wrong with us, I mean, we have kissed before and that\\'s been great! But this time it was leading somewhere and I was very aware of the fact that it was Joey touching me.  Hey! Got champagne?  Yeah baby, I\\'ll show you how we do it!  What? Oh my God! I\\'m so sorry. Joey? Are you ok?  What is the matter with us?  No, I mean with us, you know. I mean, is it supposed to be this... difficult?  Hi! Hey, listen, can we ask you a question? When you and Monica first hooked up, was it weird going from friends to... more than that?  No, no, no... No, I mean... se-x-u-ally...  Well, just because it happened that way for them doesn\\'t mean it has to happen that way for us.  Right, totally.  Yeah, and if doesn\\'t work, then we\\'ll be just one of those couples that never have sex.  I know.  Hmmm... Me too...  I wonder how Monica and Chandler could do it?  Aah... I bet you\\'re right.  Yeah.  Love you too... Alright, I\\'m going to bed.  Me too!  Okay, bla-bla-bla-bla!! Who is it?!  Hypothetically!  Uh-hmm.  Yeah that’s actually a pretty good idea.  Fine!  Yeah?  Really?!  Oh my God Phoebe! I mean I’m just—Wait a minute. If I’m your maid of honor that means you are Monica’s.  Ohh! No way Phoebe! I want to be Monica’s!  Why does it matter so much to you?!  What-what if I marry Ross—Or Joey?  Yeah but Phoebe…  Okay. Okay. It’s—since you’ve never done it before you can be Monica’s made of honor.  I’m gonna marry someone good y’know.  Phoebe is gonna be Monica’s maid of honor!  All right that’s it! I am maid of honor!  How come you are?!  Oh, come on! This is crazy! Can’t we just flip a coin?!  Okay, uh…  …it’s gonna be okay!  Look Monica, getting cold feet is very common. Y’know, it’s-it’s just because of all the anticipation and you just have to remember that you love Chandler. And also, I ran out on a wedding. You don’t get to keep the gifts.  Thanks!  Thank you judges.  Oh!  Wait a minute! She just made a scene in the middle of the ceremony!  Ohh, wait a minute, we haven’t pre…  Aw, thanks!  What?!  Hi Pheebs.  Hi! I just want to apologize. I’m really sorry I was a baby.  Yeah. Yeah, and y’know you-you deserve to win. And-and y’know I was thinking about it, if-if you’re Monica’s maid of honor that means I get to be yours.  Yeah! Oh, umm when-when Monica and Chandler got engaged I started putting some stuff together, y’know just in case…  You do? Why?  But Pheebs, y’know you earned it.  No, I was ten. I just developed early.  Hey!  God. I feel violated.  Oh, c\\'mon. She\\'s a person, you can do it!  What is it?  Tah-daaah!  Look! I cleaned! I did the windows, I did the floors... I even used all the attachments on the vacuum, except that little round one with the bristles, I don\\'t know what that\\'s for.  Well, whaddya think?  I dunno.. I-I thought it looked better there. And I- and also, it\\'s an extra seat around the coffee table.  Okay, uh, you let me go grocery shopping, and I buy laundry detergent, but it\\'s not the one with the easy-pour spout.  ..You\\'re, you\\'re \\'mah mah mah\\' what?  Who is being loud?  Ooh, do I sense a little bit of resentment?  Oh, Joey, you know what, no-one is gonna be able to tell.  Uh, Mon, you-you gonna leave your shoes out here?  Really? Just casually strewn about in that reckless haphazard manner?  Yeah, it’s just y’know…  Oh! I would love to read a poem.  Ohhh…  Wait, what do you mean you’re getting a new brain?  She is so good at throwing drinks in people’s faces, I mean I don’t think I’ve ever seen her finish a beverage.  Oh!  Cecilia Monroe man, what a great actress.  Well mainly because he\\'s kissing that other guy.  Oh yeah he\\'s too cute to be straight.  Oh, well, we can hand it to Gunther and he\\'ll put it in lost and found.  What if, um, if he calls his own cell phone to find out who found it and I answer and we start talking and we fell in love. I mean wouldn\\'t that be a great story? Kind of like a fairy tale for the digital age.  What? Wait! Why…why do you get the story?  Phoebe, you had a date three days ago.  Okay. Okay, see? I get the phone.  Oh hey-hey wait! How do we fairly decide who gets the phone?  No Phoebe! You cannot get the phone that way; that’s not fair! Okay look, I have an idea. Why don’t we, why don’t we see what kind of number he has on his speed dial, and then from that we can tell who has more in common with him. And then whoever does gets the phone.  I don’t think so.  Okay no way, you cannot use that to get the cute guy and the last blueberry muffin.  Hi Pheebs!  How are ya?  Umm Pheebs, remember when we were in the coffee house we decided that I was going to keep the uh, the cute guy’s cell phone?  And remember how I said I was going to keep it in my purse so that if it rang I could just pick it up?  And do you remember going into my purse and stealing the phone?!  You stole the phone!  No? So you’re saying that if I called it, it wouldn’t ring?  Phoebe!  Phoebe! You can’t do th…  You do know that I will be here when he comes over.  You just said it!  Oh Phoebe!  Hey! Hey!  Well why shouldn’t I?!  Well, then I get to give him the cell phone.  We’ll be right back sir.  I don’t know!  Ohh…  Hi.  Oh my God! Oh my God!! Ohh, Jessica Lockhart!! In my apartment!! I am such a huge fan! I am such a huge fan!  God. You seem really, really nice.  I mean n-not-not fake at all like most famous people.  Okay.  You are so beautiful.  No!  Ok! Can\\'t believe I\\'m risking this again, but you\\'re on! All right Joe, you remember the rules! Heads I win, tails you lose.  Oh, that sounds good!  It\\'s all done!  I know... Honey, seriously, I did it all. The luggage that I\\'m taking is in the bedroom, this is Emma\\'s Paris stuff, these are the boxes that I\\'m having shipped, and that\\'s the sandwich that I made for the plane...  It should be right next to my plane ticket.  Shoot. Oh, I can\\'t believe I did this!  No, no, no. It\\'s ok. I\\'m gonna be fine.  Well, I\\'ve been better.  You guys are gonna come and visit me, right?  I\\'m gonna miss you so much.  Oh, Pheebs, I don\\'t even know where to start.  I\\'m gonna throw this away, but thank you so much for the gesture!  I love you Phoebe.  All right. Well, if I gonna do this, I\\'d better keep going.  Ok. Monica?  Can you come here with me for a minute?  Mon... Okay... I\\'ve gotta... just say what it is I\\'m gonna say... None of the amazing things that have happened to me in the last ten years, would have happened if it wasn\\'t for you. No-one has been more like a sister to me...  Well, these aren\\'t mine. Maybe Monica used to use them with...  Well, I think you\\'re forgetting the kinkiest former resident of that room.  Oh honey...  Okay. Oh...  Oh!  Oh, you guys. This was an amazing night. Thank you so much. I love you. Good night.  What?  Ross...  You really think I didn\\'t say goodbye to you because I don\\'t care?  I cannot believe that after ten years, you do not know ONE thing about me.  Because it is too damn hard Ross. I can\\'t even begin to explain to you how much I\\'m gonna miss you. When I think about not seeing you every day, it makes me not want to go... Okay, so if you think that I didn\\'t say goodbye to you because you don\\'t mean as much to me as everybody else, you\\'re wrong. It\\'s because you mean more to me. So there, all right, there\\'s your goodbye... Oh!  What?  WHAT?  We weren\\'t doing anything!  Shhh.  No, come on, that is a lie. We also kissed in Barbados.  Yeah, you started it! I\\'ve got to chill.  We feel so terrible about this, Ross.  Ross, say something. Anything.  No, no, no!  Ross, this is not how we wanted you to find out about this. You have every right to go nuts.  No, but you know what I mean.  Calm ourselves?  Well, what would we be doing?  Feel me up?  Hey.  Oh, you bet.  Okay, well, we brought you some wine.  Well, maybe the next batch, we could all get some.  No awareness.  Look, Charlie, I just want you to know. Ross is just having a little trouble adjusting to the thought of Joey and me. You know, he normally doesn\\'t drink like this.  Ross, you don\\'t even have oven mitts on!  Ooy.  Oh my god, are we supposed to answer?  Ross, you don\\'t seem okay.  Oh, that\\'s okay, girls tend not to like me.  You know what, Ross? I think we\\'re gonna take off too.  No, no, it\\'s just that it\\'s getting late...  Yeah, that\\'s probably a good idea.  Uh-huh. Okay. You know what, Joey, I don\\'t think he\\'s ever gonna be okay with this.  Okay, Chandler!  And your horoscope says, \"On the fifth a special someone is going to give you a gift.\"  Op, but the twelfth brings a lover’s spat.  Oh, wait and on the nineteenth a secret crush announces itself.  Be-because the last one was such a big seller?  Hey!  Okay.  Hi, I’m sorry I’m late but I am ready, ready to talk you up! When does Liz’s father get here?  Oh! Ross is sooo great!  Oh good.  Paul. Umm, I just wanted you to know that Ross really is a great guy.  You just don’t look old enough to have a twenty-year-old daughter.  Oh. We?  Oh no! Yes! Of course, I know that! I just—I meant y’know are you still a ‘We’ or are you just ‘You?’  I was just getting him to like you.  Ross, Joey is not here.  Ross, it’s okay. You can come out.  Bye!  Well, y’know he lost his keys so he was looking for them…  No! Downstairs! And we got to talking y’know, for like two hours, and I really liked him so I invited him up here for a cup of coffee.  Ross, what’s the big deal? So I kissed the guy!  Wh—You dated my sister!  What? Why?!  Ross look, look this is good for you. Okay? Let’s face it, so far the guy’s not lovin’ ya! But I can turn that around! I got the inside track! We can all go out to dinner, y’know? And I can talk you up! Ross, the guy is a very, very successful lawyer!  Oh it’s important!  So it seemed that my prom date had stood me up, so Ross selflessly, offered to take me.  Wow! I definitely did not see that one backfiring! I’m gonna go to the bathroom.  Oh! Whoops! I’m sorry, you were talking about Emily!  I mean if you think about it, I mean Ross did learn something from each marriage.  Oh! I’ve got a lot of those too!  Come on Joey!!!  I can\\'t believe you would say that!  Is he romantic with her?  Are they in love?  You don\\'t know anything.  What?  Pheebs, I don’t think anyone\\'s mad about that.  Oh umm, y\\'know I lent it to Joey and I never actually got it back.  What\\'s up?!  Well yeah, I do, but I decided to take a long lunch and spend some time with my friend Monica. Y\\'know I-I feel that we don\\'t talk anymore. How are you? What is new with you?  Oh y\\'know what, we don’t have to talk about work. We can talk about anything!  Hey! Y\\'know what? Let\\'s talk about relationships!  Nothing! You go!  Ross couldn\\'t fit down the trash chute.  There he is!  Ohh, out, oh God, I don\\'t know why we didn\\'t think to check there!  You walked around all night in the city by yourself?  Yeah! No that\\'s what I was thinking.  Ross! Janice?!  Ugh, Monica, I know about you and Chandler.  I overheard you guys on the phone the other day, and you said, \"I\\'ll just tell Rachel that I\\'m doing laundry for a couple of hours.\" And he said, \"Laundry? Is that my new nickname?\" And you said, \"No! You know what your nickname is, Mr. Big.\"  Well, I wouldn\\'t know because I got so freaked out that I hung up the phone.  What?!  All right. So you\\'re telling me that there is nothing going on between you and Chandler.  Sure! Why?  What?! She just called and said that she was gonna be working late! She keeps lying to me! That\\'s it! Y\\'know what? I\\'m just gonna go over there and confront them right now!  Hey! Hi!  Well, I was actually—I-I came over here to-to borrow this lamp. To umm, look at my books, y\\'know, see them a little better.  Yeah!  Oh! What a great way to earn some extra pocket money.  Okay.  Hi!  Welcome home.  Oh! Look! I have a sonogram picture!  Well it happened about six weeks ago, and uh I had just got home from work and Ross was already there ‘cause I guess he had been hanging out with Joey.  And so I had a lot of work to do so Ross, nice guy that he is, offered to help me out. And then we had a little wine, we got to talking, and the next thing you know out of nowhere Ross comes on to me.  What is?  That-that you came on to me?  But you did! I mean, let’s be honest.  You know you kissed me first.  I was sending you signals?  Okay. So these signals Ross, explain this to me, ‘cause maybe I need to be more careful. I mean, am I sending you these signals right now?  No please, show me how I begged you!  Oh Ross!  Thank God you’re here! You have to help me! Were you just talking to yourself?  I am not gonna show you this!  I wanna see it.  Clearly you don’t want people to see this tape. Now I don’t want people to see this tape either, but you so badly don’t people to see it makes me want to see it. You see?  Ah, a little preview!  There I am.  Kinda hurtin’ my hand though.  Okay, in about ten seconds you’re gonna see him kiss me.  Okay, get ready to see some beggin’!  What?!  What are you talking about?!  How do you know about that story?!  I heard it from my friend Irene who heard it from some guy!  No. No, she told me his name was Ken Adams.  So uh, apparently people are familiar with the Europe story?  It was an amazing night.  You think it looked amazing?  Yeah, me neither. Yet…  Yeah, it would be really weird.  Good luck to you.  You are undressing very quickly.  That’s what I was gonna say.  Thank you! I had just gone to the beach that weekend.  Have you been working out?  Really? Wow, this is so much better than I…  Oh! Oh!  Oh God!  Oh, make it stop!  Make it stop!!  Have to make it stop!!  What?  Ok, well, not a problem. We\\'ll just use them to stop the bleeding. Ok. Baggage claim? Ok.  And the chicken pooped in her lap. Oh, I\\'m so sorry. I just gave away the ending, didn\\'t I? Oh! It\\'s just, I just heard this story in the cab, and it is all I can think about.  Julie! Julie, isn\\'t that great? I mean, isn\\'t that just kick-you-in-the-crotch, spit-on-your-neck fantastic?  Yeah, sure.  Did you talk to him?  Then, no.  Oh. Well then, you better go take that back because they\\'re gonna charge you for that.  How is that the silver lining?  She didn\\'t hang up either!  Okay!  Well, I sorta did a stupid thing last night.  I don\\'t know, I just kinda ran into him last night.  At his apartment. Is this juice?  Oh God, I know I\\'m a pathetic loser.  Yeah, he\\'s back. Is that a problem?  Good! I\\'m glad it\\'s not a problem.  How is she?  I\\'m okay.  What?  When I saw him get off that plane with her, I really thought I hit rock bottom. But today, it\\'s like there\\'s rock bottom, 50 feet of crap, then me.  Come on. How can I just tell him? What about Julie?  I don\\'t know, I don\\'t know.  Well, can I talk to you for a sec?  No. No-no-no-no.  Really?  No, I think that was the whole all.  No. No no no no no. That\\'s Rodney McDowell. Andie McDowell is the guy from Planet of the Apes.  You\\'re welcome.  Do you have anything that would... get us out of them?  Hey! Hey what\\'s going on?  Alright, I don\\'t wanna alarm anybody, but Monica\\'s hair is twice as big as it was when we landed!  Not Joey, no, I was just lusting after Chandler.  It\\'s not the time Charlie.  You know, this happens all the time to my computer at work.  Well, I usually go... play Tetris on somebody else\\'s computer.  Ugh.  Well, I\\'ve brought some books. We could read.  We can\\'t. We\\'re not pharmacists!  And... that\\'s the most sex I\\'m gonna have this weekend.  I know, that old lady at the end was ready to take you home.  Well, let\\'s see. There was a really big guy that I was talking to, with the really nice breasts...  No, I\\'m not blushing, I\\'m sunburnt! From, you know, the rain.  No.  Joey, come on! It doesn\\'t matter, you know, it\\'s not like anything\\'s gonna happen.  Do ya?  Later! La...  Ok. See you, bye.  Nooo!  Look at that woman sitting by the pool getting tan... so leathery and wrinkled, I\\'m so jealous!  Homo.  Oh!  Nooooo, why?  ... yeah, it\\'s true.  W-What are you, what are you talking about?  Ok... uh... maybe you\\'re not always going after the wrong girl...  Yeah, I\\'m not talking about her...  You know? Forget it!  No, I-I-I-I don\\'t, I actually don\\'t know who I\\'m talking about! So!  Yeah, sure!  Only like a month!  Shoot!  Oh yes, of course, I remember him!  But can it... just... happen a little bit?  But why, why not?  But that wasn\\'t gonna stop you before!  It\\'s not a big deal!  It\\'s so not a big deal!  Ok!  Ok, I...  AAAHHHH!  What?  Thank you.  Hi! All right, let’s go shoppin’!!  Oh, okay.  Wow! Umm....  I know.  Well, I told him I would think about it, but I’m gonna tell him no.  I don’t have any issues with my Father.  Hi!  Oh, y\\'know, it’s just like hats, and a shirt, and CD’s, just sort of stuff that you’ve left here.  No. Ross, it, it just seems that y\\'know it’s time we-we y\\'know, move on. I mean, I mean don’t’ you think?  Yeah?  Good.  Ross, you got that for free from the museum gift shop.  Okay, all right, give me the mug! I’ll keep the mug.  You know how much I love that T-shirt! You never even where that T-shirt!  Oh, you are a petty man. You are a petty, petty....  Petty...  Small...  You are so just doing this out of spite.  Huh?  You have not worn that T-shirt since you were 15!! It doesn’t even fit you anymore!  Oh. That’s so Monica can keep track. That way if one on them is missing, she can be like, ‘Where’s number 27?!’  Y\\'know what?  I can’t do this.  Well, oh, Mark, I’m doing this for the wrong reasons, y\\'know? I’m just doing it to get back at Ross. I’m sorry, it’s not very fair to you.  Oh God. I’m sorry about this.  You sure?  Oh, great. Although I did sit down where there wasn’t a chair.  Sorry. I’m so exited! I’ve been waiting for this for months! I got my hair coloured! I got new sheets! I’m making him a very fancy meal.  What am I making him by the way?  I thought I was making him filet mignon?  Wow, I really get crabby when I cook.  Oh I know, my God, this is so—this rice is so—I am so good.  Yeah, sure, okay. Okay.  All gone! So, farm birds, huh?  Oh.  But, they’re across the hall! I mean that’s two doors away, it would take them a long time to peck their way back over here.  Okay, y’know, would you feel better if we went someplace else? I mean we could pack all this stuff up and y’know go to your apartment.  Your parents’?  Ohh.  Yeah that works.  Wow! This place is fabulous!  Whoa-whoa, there’s two living rooms? God, growing up here, this place must’ve been a real babe magnet.  Ohh, you should know, this place is a real babe magnet. Wanna make out?  That sounds like a plan. Umm, is there a place I can go freshen up?  Ah.  Hi you!  I know, I can do more than cook.  Hello.  Yes!  Well, we were going to do that after—I mean umm, next.  Oh, yeah, well… Yeah, no use wasting this baby, just lyin’ around the house.  Yes.  Oh, yeah. And uh, the best part though, when the uh, waiter spilled water down my back, I jumped up, and my boob popped out.  So?  Huh.  She’s totally right! When we were together, you got all freaked out about Mark and there was nothing going on.  Absolutely! Absolutely!  What—yeah—what, y’know what? I hope Emily is a lesbian.  Yeah, so what is she, like a... like a spokesmodel, or an aerobics instructor, what?  Well maybe she and her friends are just having a contest to see who can bring home the biggest geek.  Oh, The Velveteen Rabbit! Oh my God, when the boy\\'s love makes the rabbit real!  Huh. Well, then you\\'d better keep it away from Ross\\'s hair. So this is pretty rare. How did you get that?  Oh, honey, that\\'s so sweet.  Oh my God! What happened?  Yes, you have to get her something, and it should be something really nice.  And not one of your coupons for an hour of \"Joey Love.\"  No! I\\'m sorry, honey, it\\'s just that last week I got all but three answers and I really want to finish a whole one without any help.  Hey, how\\'d it go?  You know what we should all do? Go see a musical.  And you know which one we should see? The 1996 Tony award winner. Do you happen to know the name of that one?  No....  Yes! Rent!  What? Oh, I\\'m sorry, I can\\'t, I\\'m busy.  Okay, honey, what he means by that, is ...while this is a very nice gift, maybe it\\'s just not something a boyfriend gives?  Any luck?  All right, look. Why don\\'t you just return the book, let Joey give her the clock pen, and you give her something worse than that. Like... a regular pen.  Aw, honey, that\\'s so sweet.  I did it! Oh! I finished it! I did it all by myself! And there\\'s nobody to hug!  Hey! Hey, you guys, I finished the crossword all by myself! Hug me!  Thanks!  Thank you! Hey, how\\'d the catering go?  Ok.  What\\'s up?  But what about Phoebe?  Ok, ok, so you\\'re not a fan, but I mean, come on, you cannot do this to her.  Oh, no no no no. Oh no no no no. I have to do this to her?  Honey, I\\'m sorry.  Terry is a jerk, ok? That\\'s why we\\'re always saying \"Terry\\'s a jerk!\" That\\'s where that came from.  Ok, you know what, lemme, let me just see what else I can do. All right, look, look. Why don\\'t you just let her go on after Stephanie whatever-her-name-is. I mean, you won\\'t even be here. You don\\'t pay her. It\\'s not gonna cost you anything.  Come on, Terry, I\\'ll even clean the cappuccino machine.  Of course I clean it. I mean, I,I will cleeeean it. I mean, I will cleeeean it.  Done.  Yeah. Who\\'s workin\\' for you babe?  What?  Oh, no, no no. I meant that he\\'s gonna be paying that other woman beause she\\'s a professional.  Well, but Pheebs.  Ok, everybody, let\\'s give a uh nice warm Central Perk welcome to--  Uh, to Stephanie Schiffer.  Hey.  Here. I thought you might be cold.  Whoa, look at you, you did pretty well.  Do you?  Well, you know, honey, I don\\'t think everybody gets Smelly Cat. You know, I mean, if all you\\'ve ever actually had are healthy pets, then, whoosh!  Well, people missed you in there. And in fact, there was actually a request for \"Smelly Cat\".  Well, from me. And I know it\\'s not your big money song, but it\\'s my favorite.  Hi! Oh, how was your date last night?  What-what?! You’re gonna leave this person with me?!  Why?! What?! Are you kidding?!  Y’know what? That’s a lot to remember, can’t I just tell her you’re a pig?  Well forget it, I’m not telling that girl anything. That is not my responsibility.  Hi.  Yeah, Joey kinda disabled it when I moved in.  Hi.  Yeah, we ended up spending the day together and had such a great time!  I know!  Oh and I’ll call ya too!  Bye!  Oh Joey, I’m sorry I just couldn’t tell her all those things you wanted me to tell her. And y’know we got to talking and I…  Cupid.  Look Joey, come on she’s so perfect for you! I mean she’s sweet, she-she likes baseball, and she-she had two beers at lunch.  Yeah, maybe if you gave this girl a chance it would go somewhere.  Phoebe!  I’m sorry?  Oh my God! Did you get to see anything good?  Yeah, there was. It was—there the corner of the library where-where all these dusty books that nobody ever read—Yes, there was.  Well now what’s the rush?  Well look who’s here!  Hi! Well, we were just about to take off and see a movie. Oh no!  Oh Phoebe, we forgot that party we have to go to.  How did it go with Erin?  So how’s it goin’ with Joey?  Okay? Wait okay, tell-tell me that you like him, please? I mean tell me that you like him.  But you said that you liked him! I mean what happened?! Did ya just change your mind?!  Ugh, tramp!  Yeah, see ya.  Wow. Well, I guess it was Cupid who brought her here.  Hi!  Jo-Joey, look honey we-we need to talk okay? Umm, I kinda got the feeling from her today that uh, she’s not lookin’ for a serious relationship.  Well, she told me. She said she’s kinda a loner.  Joey…  Yeah and honey I promise next time that I will just say good-bye and tell ‘em you’re not looking for a relationship.  Do you want some pancakes?  I love how he cares so much about stuff. If I squint I can pretend he’s Alan Alda.  Are ah, having dinner with my Dad tomorrow night, I hope that’s okay.  Ross, my father doesn’t hate you.  Thank you.  Hi Daddy!  You remember Ross.  Yeah, actually Daddy Ross is allergic to lobster.  Okay.  Aw honey stop! It’s not that bad.  Yeah. That’s Daddy.  Yes, it bothers me Ross, but y\\'know if he was a regular at the coffee house, I’d be serving him sneezers.  So. Ross, I’ve bugged him about this a million times, he’s not gonna change.  Well um, I don’t.  Oh Daddy, no he didn’t mean anything by that, he really didn’t.  You had to do it, didn’t you? You couldn’t just leave it alone.  Um. yeah.  All right, look, here’s the bottom line Ross, this is fixable, if we act fast, okay. So, I’ll invite him to brunch tomorrow and you can make nice.  Okay, look, Ross, I realise that my Father is difficult, but that’s why you have got to be the bigger man here.  Okay, well can’t you just try it one more time Ross? For me? For me?  What? What? He’s interested in you. He-he likes your hair, he just wants to know how you got here.  What?!  He’s got this thing. And I keep telling him to go to my chiropractor...  Excuse me, Dr. Bobby happens to be an excellent doctor.  Well that’s his last name.  It’s Robert Bobby.  And um, excuse me, he helps me.  With my alignment. I’ve got one leg shorter than the other.  What? It’s true, my right leg is two inches shorter.  I’m sorry, let her?  No.  Yeah honey, I’m standing right there! Why didn’t you just tell him about the mole I haven’t got checked yet.  Oh, thank you for doing that. I just can’t deal with this just quite yet.  You said that she was, I just didn’t disagree with you.  Oh yeah.  James Brolin?  Ed Begley Jr. is not gay.  No.  No!  Thank you.  Ugh! Look honey y’know what? I haven’t told him yet, so until I do I don’t think I should tell anybody else.  Phoebe!!  Okay.  Honey, stop it! I am not going to tell you until I tell him.  Oh y’know what honey? Let’s not talk about that right now?  Sure, but come on, as big as your wedding?  Yeah.  Hey! Y’know, sometimes you can do everything right, everyone can wear everything they’re supposed to wear, and one of those little guys just gets through!  I don’t know! Maybe they have tools.  Well, maybe that’s, maybe that’s really brave.  Maybe she hasn’t really thought it through that well.  Uh-hmm. I’m just thinking about Phoebe; poor knocked up Phoebe.  What?!  How many ways are there to do that?  All right, I’ll-I’ll take it again when I get home.  Okay. Thank you.  Oh, you guys are so great.  Wh—Hey, I just gave you peeing on a stick.  How much longer?  30 seconds, okay.  Oh wait! Y’know what? I can’t, I can’t look at it. I can’t. Somebody else tell me, somebody tell me.  Okay.  What?  What?!  Are you sure?  Oh!  Oh-oh, that’s a risky little game!  Ah, it’s still not the time.  Hey, Sophie!  Thanks for lunch, Chandler. Y\\'know, you didn’t have to walk me all the way back up here.  Honey um, honey, you do realise that we don’t keep the women’s lingerie here in the office?  Bye, Chandler.  Oh, nothing, he’s just goofy like that, I actually, hardly notice it anymore.  No!! No! He’s not married, or involved, with anyone!  Well, I’ll ask him for you, if you want me too?  I need to talk to you!  Oh, sorry. I meant Chandler.  Okay, my boss, Joanna, when you left, she started asking questions about you...  Oh thank you, Chandler, this is so great, she’s gonna love me.  Wow!!  What’s this?  All right!  Hmm.  What?!  Oh, I....  Oh, I know...  Ohh, gee. I wonder why she thinks you’re going to call her?  You can’t just say, ‘Nice to meet you, good night?’  Well, they always called.  No. Sorry.  Okay, okay. Umm, well ah, maybe he, maybe he feels awkward because you are my boss.  Well...  No. I...  Why hasn’t he called Rachel? Why? Why? I don’t understand. Why? He said he’ll call. Why? Why? Chandler I’m telling you she has flipped out, she’s gone crazy!  Come on, this isn’t funny. She thinks it’s my fault that you haven’t called her. You have to call her!  Well then you’re going to have to take her out again.  I don’t care! I don’t care! You are going to have to take her out again and end it, and end it in way that she knows it’s actually ended. And, I don’t care how hard it is for you, do not tell her that you will call her again!  That’s fine!  I know.  Sophie’s desk.  Chandler!!  Hey. Whe-ell, look at you, finally got that time machine workin\\' huh?  Hey.  Woah, woah, woah, what book is this?  Men just take out wind?  Wow.  Well that sounds kinda cool, kinda like The Hobbit.  Oh, God, oh, God, I mean it\\'s just so.  Uhh, I mean this is like reading about my own life. I mean this book could have been called \\'Be Your Own Windkeeper Rachel\\'.  NO!  No, why do we always have to do everything according to your time table?  No, see this isn\\'t about the movie theatre, this is about you stealing my wind.  Yes, my wind. How do you expect me to grow if you won\\'t let me blow?  Ok, I just, I just really need to be with myself right now. I\\'m sorry.  You\\'re right, I don\\'t have to apologize. Sorry. Damnit!  Yeah you like totally let him wash his feet in the pool of your inner power.  Ok, ok, ok, moving on, moving on, next question. Ok number 29, have you ever betrayed another goddess for a lightning bearer? Ok, number 30.  Not uh, not to my recollection.  Only \\'cause you took up half the circle.  Well not when they find out you slept with Jason Hurley an hour after he broke up with Monica.  Here are your cakes.  No, I know, they\\'re from me. Look you guys this is not good. I mean we have enough trouble with guys stealing our wind without taking it from each other.  You know.  Thank you. So are we good?  We\\'re good?  Ok, let me take these cakes back \\'cause they\\'re gonna take that out of my paycheck.  Um... yeah. Well, I mean, when I first met you, y\\'know, I thought maybe, possibly, you might be...  Yeah, but then you spent Phoebe\\'s entire birthday party talking to my breasts, so then I figured maybe not.  So, um, did she...  Sure. I just sharpened her this morning.  Oh, you-you mean your earrings?  Yes. Paolo sent them from Italy.  Oh no! My new Paolo shoes!  You!  Hey, who\\'s this little naked guy?  Aww, look at the little thing.  Wow, Monica, you look just like your grandmother. How old was she there?  Hi!  Wow! Have you ever rescued anyone from a burning building before?  Wow, he\\'s cute, Pheebs! But I thought you just started dating that Kindergarten teacher.  What-Pheebs?! Two dates in one day? That\\'s so unlike you.  Hi!  And?  Well honey, then why don\\'t you break up with one of them?  So Pheebs, pick one of them.  Monica\\'s gonna marry a millionaire!!!  Mon you definitely have to make it a theme wedding, and the theme could be, “Look how much money we’ve got!” Y\\'know, I mean you could put, you could put money in-in the invitations! You-you could have like little money place settings. And ah, you could start with a money salad! I mean it’ll be dry, but people will like it.  Oh please, what do you know! You married a lesbian!  You didn’t break up with that fireman?  Wow!  So I don\\'t go back to work for another four weeks, but we would like our nanny to start right away, so that Emma could get a chance to know her.  That\\'s great, great. So do you have any questions for us?  Really nice to meet you... and we\\'ll call you.  Sandy, that\\'s exactly what it is...  Ross!  Oh!  Oh, that\\'s pretty.  Oh God, she mu... she must need her diaper changed.  So wh..? He\\'s smart, he\\'s qualified. Give me one good reason we shouldn\\'t try him out.  Why?  Oooh... ***I really can\\'t hear what she says*** come here.  Oh yeah, it\\'s fine, it\\'s fine. Sandy was just... was just telling me about how he proposed to his fiancée and it was just sooo beautiful.  I can\\'t... I can\\'t hear it again.  Look, Ross, he\\'s just... Sandy is just sensitive, that\\'s all.  What...? Too sensitive to take care of our baby?  Sandy made Madeleines.  Well, I... you know, I-I-I don\\'t know what to say... I mean, I never thought of you as a guy who needed his men to be men. You know, \\'cause I gotta tell you Ross, it not like you just came in from branding cattle.  That was kind of rude!  You know, he was just doing his job...  Oh, come on Ross...  Yes, but you can not tell Ross \\'cause I want to surprise him.  Hi. Well hey, you don\\'t - you don\\'t think they\\'re kind of cool?  Well I. . .  Uh-huh.  No. Well, yeah, maybe.  What\\'s 1922?  Yes I do, it\\'s just that Ross is. . .  No.  You?  I know, so do I. Oh Phoebe, I\\'m so glad you made me do this. OK, lemme se yours.  Phoebe we just saw mine, let me see yours.  You didn\\'t get it?  Why didn\\'t you get it?  Phoebe, how would you do this to me? This was all your idea.  Really? You don\\'t say, because mine was licked on by kittens.  Oh.  Is Ross here?  What? You didn\\'t get one.  That is not a tattoo, that is a nothing. I finally got her back in the chair, bairly touched her with a needle, she jumped up screaming, and that was it.  Maybe. But just a little one. Phoebe got the whole world.  Well?  Really?  I guess.  Yeah, who\\'s gonna eat all our food, and tie up our phone lines, and - is that my bra? What the hell you doin\\' with my bra?  Thanks, Mon.  Monica!!!  I just saw Danny getting on the subway with a girl and he had his arm around her.  Well, you should be, this is all your fault! You meddled in our relationship!!  No, but I was doing my thing and everything was going according to the plan!  She was kinda stupid. You\\'re right. All right, I\\'m just gonna go on the date. I\\'m gonna go on the date. That is the new plan.  So did I. I\\'m really glad Monica asked us out.  Hi!  Hey, umm, can I ask you guys something?  Uh, I don\\'t have any brothers so I don\\'t know, but uh, did you guys wrestle?  Well, I met Danny\\'s sister yesterday, and uh that was actually the girl on the subway.  Yeah, they were very y\\'know…wrestley. But, I guess that\\'s normal?  Oh, great!  Okay, see? I told you!  Yeah uh, y\\'know what uh, let\\'s skip it.  Umm, you-you and your sister seem to have umm, a very special bond, and…  Well, okay, look. I don\\'t know, listen, I don\\'t know what\\'s going on here but let\\'s…  No, I have two sisters. But one of them has a very masculine energy.  No-no, they\\'re not very nice people.  Well, uh, I-I don\\'t know. See when-when you put it that way y\\'know it does sort of…  I\\'m doing just fine! God, Tiffany, you smell so great!  Oh, y\\'know Joey, you are sick!  I\\'m not reading this!  Hey! You remembered to put clothes on this morning.  Oh, Joey, it\\'s so great to be back here. I gotta tell you, you\\'re making it so easy on me and Emma.  Well, I\\'ll probably be back to pick her up around six, but she\\'s in the bedroom all ready to go. But she did actually fall back to sleep, so...  Bye!  Hey!  You guys aren\\'t doing anything tonight, are you?  I was just asking \\'cause I need someone to watch Emma tonight.  Well, Phoebe set me up on a date.  Why? What\\'s the big deal?  What, slept together a year and a half ago? Yeah, I\\'m all set.  So I\\'ll bring her by around seven? Is that okay?  Oh, you guys are gonna have so much fun! She\\'s at such a cute age. Oh, a couple things. Now that she\\'s eating solid food, she poops around the clock. And watch out for your hair, \\'cause she likes to grab it. And oh, she\\'s also in this phase where if you leave the room, she screams bloody murder, but ah... Thanks, you guys. Have fun!  Wow, everything looks so good! I think I\\'m gonna have the chicken.  Oh, well, that\\'s - that\\'s very sweet. Thank you.  What?  Well, come on, Steve; let\\'s not rule out nervous laughter. Hey, now wait a minute. Phoebe told me that - that you owned your own restaurant. That\\'s impressive.  Really? What\\'s that like?  Really?  Phoebe, it\\'s me. I\\'m going to hunt you down and kill you!  This is the worst date ever. How could you set me up with this creep?  I don\\'t care! This guy is a nightmare!  He\\'s not stoned.  Yeah, four times.  No, no, no, I admire a man who can cry.  Don\\'t touch my coat!  Oh, sorry, it\\'s my phone. Hello?  Oh my god, this is the worst date ever!  No.  What? What do you mean, \"there you are\"? Where was she?  Well, uh...  Really, really not.  All right, well that\\'s good to know. Good night, Steve.  I just had a rough night.  Eww!  Oh, well, I...It\\'s kind of weird talking to you about this, but...  Yeah.  Oh.  Oh, oh no. Do you think she walked in, saw you and left?  Well, if it makes you feel any better, I wish my date hadn\\'t shown up.  Well, he makes t-shirts for a living, and he thought it would be appropriate to give me this.  Oh. Huh. You know, it is weird that Phoebe would set me up on a date that was awful on the same night that Joey set you up on a date that didn\\'t even show.  Do you think it\\'s possible for two friends to fool around and... and not have it be a big deal?  No reason.  Yeah  Yeah! You know, ever since I had that dream about him, and can\\'t get it out of my head! And what\\'s the big deal, people do it all the time!  Ok, off the top of my head... Don and Janet.  I know them from work.  No, one of them...  I don\\'t know, what were the names I just said?  Hey!  Yeah, it\\'s a real shame you can\\'t make it to that one-woman show tonight.  And you weren\\'t going to tell us? How did you think you were gonna get away with that?  You do that every year??  Oh, that\\'s why you got these tickets to that play, to get rid of us??  And last year is that why you sent us to that medieval times restaurant?  OH! And the year before that, when you set up that nighttime tour of that button factory?  Joey, why wouldn\\'t you invite us to your parties?  Well, then so you just invite me...!  Oh, Joey, come on! Please, please! Let me come, I will behave, I promise! I will behave! Please, please, please...  I don\\'t know! I think it\\'s kind of serious! Oh, you know... I was watching this thing on TV this morning about... Newcastle disease... and I think I might have it!!  ... Ok, who is this?  Oh, hi! I would check your hand but... I\\'m sure you don\\'t want to get my chicken disease!  What? Yes, I am!  Oh, no, no! I heard you before, that is so not what this is!  And he didn\\'t want you guys to know about it but I came over here to tell you!!  Ok professor or detective?  Yeah, and he does it every year! That\\'s why he\\'s sending you to that play! That\\'s why he sent us to that medieval restaurant and to that button factory!  Ok actually Mon, Matthew was just giving me his phone number.  Nice to meet you.  Ok  Yeah!  Yeah, well, I guess I have forgotten about Joey and clearly you\\'ve forgotten about Chandler!  I always loved that!!  Joey, you\\'re so sweet.  Oh, Very funny... Joey.  I just wanted to let you know I\\'ve changed my mind: I\\'m gonna do it, I\\'m gonna kiss Joey.  Please, what about you and Chandler?  I could, I could but I don\\'t want to! I want to kiss Joey!  No.  Yeah.  Oh, Monica made me send her to my mother\\'s. Apparently babies and weddings don\\'t mix.  Uh... November?  Hey Pheebs...  Uhm... you haven\\'t told these guys what they\\'re doing in the wedding yet.  What, what, what, no, I don\\'t wanna do that.  Happy wedding day!  Ok-dokey, Joey, listen. This is gonna be bridesmaid central, all right? We\\'re gonna have hair and make-up going on in the bathroom and oh, I had to move a couple of things in the fridge to make room for the corsages.  What d\\'you want?  Oh, Ross, c\\'mon, please! Don\\'t make this harder than it already is!  Well, Chandler said that it\\'s really important to him too!  Oh, you are the lesser of two evils!  Hi  Even so, I think I\\'m gonna pick Ross.  All right fine, I pick you.  Well, in my defense, you were not supposed to tell each other.  Who\\'s there?  Uh.  You know what, I can\\'t do this. I don\\'t know which one of you guys to pick.  Since when do you watch the news?  Wow, you know, it\\'s so beautiful out there. You always wanted to get married outside. Why don\\'t you guys just do it on the street?  Well, look, it\\'s hardly snowing anymore. I mean you couldn\\'t ask for a more romantic setting. This could be the simple wedding you\\'ve always wanted!  Geez Ross, you could have showered.  No.  Shut up!  All right, all right, all right. Last night, I had a dream that, uh, you and I, were...  Well, you were pretty damn good.  Well, last night you seemed to know your way around the table.  Get off.  What are you playing with?  Off to see young Ethan?  Just a touch. Mon, I don\\'t understand. I mean, you\\'ve been dating this guy since like, what... his midterms? I mean, why all the sudden are you so... Oh.  Could tonight be the Night?  So, did you shave your legs?  A-ha!  No, forget it.  No.  No, it was just the three of us.  There were times when it wasn\\'t even me.  Mon, Ethan called again. Mon?  Ethan called again.  I, I didn\\'t say any... I sw... I did not say anything, I swear. He stopped by.  Where are you going?  True story.  Let\\'s dry \\'em again.  Ross?  You are. Well, um... We, we, we were just...  Wow!  What?  What?  I don\\'t know where the phone is.  Ross?  What, so I can\\'t lokk nice? There might be doctors there.  Rossy, Rossy.  Any sign of your brother?  I thought you only met him once?  Well relax, he’ll be here.  Now, you do realize that she’s a cartoon, and way out of your league?  Oh, I don’t know, I guess, Chris O’Donnel, John F. Kennedy, Jr., Daniel Day Lewis, Sting, and Parker Stevenson.  Hardy Boy.  What about you honey, who would be on your list?  Hi!  Well, so, now, do you guys have a lot of big plans?  Three of your five, what?  Oh my God! You are giving this a lot of thought.  So?  Yeah, ‘cause that’s why you won’t get Isabella Rosselini, geography.  Well, it’s about time.  Okay honey, you do realize she only spins like that on ice.  Oh!  Come on!  Oh-oh, you lie.  Ross, it took you ten years to finally admit you liked me.  You know what honey, you go ahead, we’ll call her an alternate.  Okay.  Honey, he’s about to go hit on Isabella Rosselini. I’m just sorry we don’t got popcorn.  Hey.  Uhh, the mailman, the super.  What?  Ooh, goooosh, ooh, these are cookies smashed in the sports section.  Horrible and degrading list of reasons not to be with me?  Phoebe, I thought your dad was in prison.  How have you never been on Oprah?  Well, that doesn\\'t sound like a very merry Christmas.  No, nothin\\'.  Wha... forget it Ross, no, I am not gonna stand here and make a list of. . .  OK, you\\'re whiney, you are, you\\'re obsessive, you are insecure, you\\'re, you\\'re gutless, you know, you don\\'t ever, you don\\'t just sort of seize the day, you know. You like me for what, a year, you didn\\'t do anything about it. And, uh, oh, you wear too much of that gel in your hair.  Oh, gosh, it\\'s hot in here.  Did you just break the radiator?  I\\'ll call the super.  Oh, yeah, well hey, welcome to our sauna.  Yeah, I\\'m with Mon.  What\\'cha gonna\\' do?  Nice seizing. . . gel boy.  Huh-huh, no act--no, uhh, that, that is basil.  Huh-hoo, yeah, no, it\\'s still basil.  Wiper blades. I don\\'t even have a car.  Well, I hope the ends of these sentences are good.  Yeah, yeah.� Phoebe and I are going to have so much fun.� And thank you for watching the baby, by the way.  Phoebe\\'s Mike?  I didn\\'t know you guys hung out.  Oh that\\'s so cute:� Ross and Mike\\'s first date.� Is that going to be awkward?� I mean, what are you guys going to talk about?  Yeah.  Hey.  Oh God.� It seems like forever ago.  Well, um . . . I don\\'t know.� I mean, for a long time nothing.� But you know, actually right before you picked me up, Ross and I had a . . . ah . . . little thing.  Well, um, first he told me he liked how I looked.� And, ah, then we had a little . . . um . . . eye-contact.  Mm-hmm.  No!� Wait!� No, no.� Don\\'t do that!� That\\'s going to make them think they can come over here.  Well, we\\'re not here to meet guys.� You have a boyfriend, I have a b. . . baby and a Ross.  Oh my God.� I can\\'t believe you live in that building.� My grandmother lives in that building.� Ida Green?� No sense of personal space?� Kind of smells like chicken?� Looks like a potato.  That\\'s my bubby!  Oh, well, it\\'s complicated. I don\\'t actually have a boyfriend.� But um. . .  Great.  I don\\'t know.� He was cute, and he liked me.� It was an impulse.  No.� No, because I know exactly how the conversation\\'s gonna go.� \"Hey Ross, you know, I think we had a moment before.\"  Oh, thanks.  Well, the point is, maybe I should just stop waiting around for moments with Ross, you know?� I should just . . . move on with my life.  I don\\'t know.� Do I have to decide right now?  Hi.  Oh . . .  Wow.� So, what did you guys do?  That was fun Pheebs.  Oh, around 8:30?  Then, again at 9:00?  Yeah.  Oh, it was so much fun.� It felt so good to be out.  Is Monica here?  All right listen umm, I just bought something I\\'m not sure she\\'s gonna like it, and it\\'s gonna seem a little crazy, but this is something that I wanted since I was a little girl.  Noo! I wish! Okay, you ready?  It\\'s a, it\\'s a cat!  Yes it is!  Excuse me! But this is a purebred, show-quality Sphinx cat!  Well, it was a little extravagant, but I a pretty good deal.  A thousand bucks.  All right listen ball boys! My grandmother had one of these when I was a little girl and it was the sweetest thing! I mean it was so cute, it would sit in my lap and purr all day long, and I would drag a shoestring on the ground and he would chase it!  Hey.  Oh, wow! Congratulations, that\\'s quite a waste of time.  Yeah?  Well, it\\'s my cat.  Oh yeah, I got a cat.  You guys this cat is nothing like my grandmother\\'s cat. I mean, it\\'s not sweet, it\\'s not cute, I even dragged that little string on the ground, and it just flipped out and scratched the hell out of me. And I swear, I know this sounds crazy, but every time this cat hisses at me I know it\\'s saying, \"Rachel!\"  Well, I was gonna let you play with it.  I tried! They won\\'t take her back.  Well, they said would but they would only give me store credit. I mean, what am I going to do, get a thousand regular cats?  It\\'s not a baby! It\\'s a cat!  Well, so then what are you doing to me? Okay? Just get out of here! All right? Move on!  Yes! Thank you! Exactly! You want it?  Oh, terrific! That\\'ll be $2,000.  Okay, a thousand.  Well, I do, but you\\'re just gonna have to actually look at this as more of an investment than a cat.  Yeah, 15 hundred dollars.  Phoebe! It\\'s 6 o\\'clock in the morning! Why aren\\'t you at Gary\\'s?  Phoebe, are you okay?  Phoebe, honey, wanna get some breakfast?  Yeah, it is amazing it lasted that long.  Uh well, y\\'know what? I don\\'t think if I feel comfortable stealing on my very first day…  Okay guys, way to wish me luck!  …and then they came back from smoking and they had made all of the decisions without me!  I know! It\\'s like I\\'m being punished for not having this disgusting, poisoning habit!  I mean what if this keeps happening? Y\\'know, they\\'ll-they\\'ll be outside smoking, making all the decisions and I\\'ll just be up in my office breathing my stupid clean air, y\\'know? And then when the day comes when Kim wants to promote one of us, who do you think she\\'s gonna pick? Me or Smokey Smokerson?  Yeah, I can do that.  I would love to!  Oh well, it\\'s kinda lonely up there, so I just thought I would come out here and get some fresh air.  Oh great!  Oh that\\'s okay.  Oh, I thought you guys meant marijuana cigarettes, y\\'know? Y\\'know what I mean, like dubbies? And I actually, I thought to myself, \"Wow, those guys are crazy!\" But no, I actually smoke the regular ones all, all the time.  Oh, me too.  Oh it was great! It was great! I went down there just like you said, y\\'know? And we talked business. Kim totally took my opinions.  Thanks!  Well-well that\\'s \\'cause I went down there and they were all smoking. This is actually the smell of success.  I did not!  All right, fine! But I had too! I had to do it for my career!  No well, no it\\'s not that bad, y\\'know? I mean yeah, my tongue feels a little fuzzy and these fingers sort of smell, I actually feel like I can throw up.  Well then let\\'s just quit! We\\'ll just quit! Let\\'s all quit!  Oh but you could. You can. Absolutely! We can help each other out! We can get--what are those--those patches! We could be like the Patch Sisters!  Hey! Hey-hey-hey!!  Come on you guys! What are doing?! I thought we were the patch sisters!  Well y\\'know if you, if you started smoking again you could\\'ve at least told me! Come on, give me one of those! What are we talking about?  Oh wait, no-no-no! Drag me down. Drag-drag me down.  What?! What?! My birthday\\'s not for another month!  Oh my God! You guys this is so great! I mean it\\'s so unexpected! I mean Chandler\\'s birthday is even before mine!  Wow! This is great! Look at all these cups! This is so weird.  Oh, okay, not so weird.  No?  Oh!  Oh, uh, Joanna I was wondering if I could ask you something. There’s an opening for an assistant buyer in Junior Miss…  Well, actually, I meant for me. The hiring committee is meeting people all day and…  God, I am so glad you don’t have a problem with this, because if you did, I wouldn’t even consider applying.  Ohh! That’s great!  Really?!  Well, I, umm…  Thank you.  Well, they uh, they-they do more than that.  Yes, Joanna really has been an incredible mentor to me.  I-I-I of course, I have more responsibilities than that.  Yes, I realize that…  I love working with designers!  There’s nobody here!  Do you want me to quit?  What?  My drinking?  Said what? Exactly.  Oh my God!! Ohh, that is it! I’m leaving! You are just a horrible person!  Say more things like that.  I’d need an expense account.  And an assistant.  Hey Mon, little question for ya! How do you think this suit will look on an assistant buyer?  Oh my God!! You just ruined the thing I was practicing the whole way home, but I’m soo happy!  Ohh, you’ve waited soo long.  Hey, Pheebs, quick question for ya.  How do you think this suit would look on an assistant buyer at Bloomingdale’s?  Yes!!!  I’m an assistant buyer!!  Oh, hi Mrs. Lynch! Is Joanna in already?  Heard what?  Oh my God! How?!  Oh my God! Oh, I cannot believe it!  Yes, so close. Mrs. Lynch, I know that this is an emotional and difficult time, for all of us. But by any chance did Joanna send any paperwork your way before… it happened.  Yes-yes, just a few seconds and she’d still be with us—nothing about an assistant buyer?  Oh, Sophie, I guess you didn’t hear about Joanna…  Hi!  So did they call you to tell you your name’s gonna be in this?  Oh, come on Joey! You will totally keep it in check this time, and plus y’know the publicity would be really good for your career! And you deserve that! And if you do the interview you can mention, oh I don’t know, gal pal Rachel Green?  Okay, don’t listen to him. Please?  Oh yeah, I’d actually love a blueberry muffin and a chamomile tea.  That is the Coast Guard.  Oh! Yay! Look! There’s a piece that doesn’t have floor on it!  Hey, come on now!  You too!  Oh, Joey! Sorry!  Oh but look! That’s gonna leave a stain!  Really?  I’ve never lived like this before.  Oh my God, Jill!  And you know Monica and Ross!  Yeah!  Wow! I can’t believe they didn’t put it in the part where you said you didn’t watch soap operas.  Ohh, whoa God! Storage rooms give me the creeps! Monica, come on please hurry up honey! Please?  I want the little round waffles.  Okay, y\\'know what? I\\'ll-I\\'ll have toast!  Arghhhh!!!!!!  You guys! You guys!  It was like this crazy-eyed, hairy beast man! He was like a, like a bigfoot or a yeti or something!  Yeah!  Please! We did not fog Danny! Who\\'s Danny?  Hi! You might not remember us, but we are the girls that fogged you.  Hi! Just so you know, we-we didn\\'t mean to fog you, we thought you were like a yeti or something.  Hi! Sorry to bother you, but I don\\'t think we can accept your acceptance of our apology, it just doesn\\'t really seem like you mean it.  Really! What is with that guy? I mean you\\'d forgive me if I fogged you.  Oh my God, honey, I\\'m so sorry!  Really?  Oh my God! Oh my God, look at these pelts!  What? Uhh, Phoebe, honey, honey, I know you\\'re quirky and I get a big kick out of it, we all do actually, but if you destroy a coat like this that is like a crime against nature! Not nature, fashion!  Hi!  What? Yeti—I mean Danny?  Oh. Listen, I\\'m so sorry. I would, I would\\'ve never fogged you if y\\'know if you hadn\\'t looked so…. Y\\'know.  What? Hey! No-no-no! This not cool! You don\\'t even know me!  So from that you think you\\'ve got me all figured out? Well, you don\\'t! Y\\'know I-I could have toys for underprivileged kids in here!  Well, y\\'know, if-if kids like to play with Capri pants.  And stop saying that! I hate that!  Fine! I judged you. I made a snap judgement. But you did it too! And you are worse because you are sticking to your stupid snap judgement! You can\\'t even open up your mind for a second to see if you\\'re wrong! What does that say about you?  What?!  Okay. Okay.  Oh, I went to have pizza. With Danny.  That yeti is one smooth talker.  Yeah, y\\'know I-I think I\\'m just gonna hang out in my room.  Come on you guys! Listen, if Emily knew I was here having dinner you with you she would flip out and you know it. It\\'s okay, I really… I don\\'t mind.  Ross, I…  Okay. Okay. Joey, it\\'s okay. Settle down.  I haven\\'t seen him in so long!  Ross, honey, is there anything we can do?  They made you head of the department!  Yeah.  Uh, Paul’s Caf�. They got great food and it’s really romantic.  Yeah! Oh, and then afterwards you can take her to the Four Seasons for drinks. Or you go downtown and listen to some jazz. Or dancing—Oh! Take her dancing!  Ooh, I miss dating. Gettin’ all dressed up and going to a fancy restaurant. I’m not gonna be able to do that for so long, and it’s so much fun! I mean not that sitting at home worrying about giving birth to a sixteen pound baby is not fun.  Huh?  What?! Joey, you don’t want to go on a date with a pregnant lady.  All right?  Ohh, Lilies. Joey, they’re my favorite. Thank you.  Yeah, actually that’s my roommate’s.  Ah yes, but he’s very protective of me so you’d better watch yourself.  Hm-mmm.  Now the filet mignon, what comes with that?  Emmm. Now, instead of the vegetables, is there anyway I can substitute the three-pound lobster?  Wow! This is shaping up to be a pretty good date—Oh, I almost forgot. I didn’t pay you the rent check.  Okay. Wow! So I get to see what Joey Tribbiani is like on a date. So do you have any moves?  I knew it! I knew it. Come on tell me your moves.  Oh my God. And that works?!  Oh, you poor little famous man.  Alright. So where’d you grow up?  Come on, just answer the question!  And so were-were you close to your parents?  Why not?  Huh?  Thank you! And now if you’ll excuse me, I have to go to the rest room.  And now you’re watching me walk away.  I am not gonna answer that!  No one! They are my friends, I wouldn’t punch any of them.  Yeah, but I don’t know why. Look at me, I’m having such a wonderful time!  I know!  Joey, I think everyone saw the wine come out of your nose.  Well that is because you have never been on a date with me before.  All right, now don’t judge me. I normally wait until my date leaves, but you live here. I’m ripping into this swan.  So tell me, what are Joey Tribbiani’s end of the night moves?  How do you do that?  Oh my God!  No, I don’t want to tell you.  Because it’s embarrassing.  All right, I gotta go to bed. Honey, I had such a wonderful time.  …you were 50 minutes late to the class, what did you crawl there?!  Well, why didn’t you just take a cab?  Well you’re not gonna be able to keep doing this.  You what?  Right. Wow!  Hi! Hey, remember how last night we were talking about that movie Cujo?  Relax! It’s not like it’s Citizen Kane!  Yeah I know it’s really boring, but it’s like a big deal. Anyway, I was thinking about renting Cujo sometime.  Well don’t you have that big date tonight?  Hey Joey, can I ask you something?  After our date last night, did you feel a little weird?  Yeah, I mean I was up sick all night.  Really?! How come we didn’t cross paths?  Oh God! Thank God you’re home! I’m watching Cujo.  Yes! But what is wrong with this dog?!  No! No! Seriously, what’s wrong with the dog?! Wait a minute, what are you doing home so early? What happened to your date?  Oh. Do you want to watch the rest of the movie with me?  Yeah but y’know what they say Mon, \"There’s no such thing as bad press.\"  I didn’t write it.  Ross!  I am freaking out!  My due date is in one week!  That is seven days!  I’m serious.  Okay. Thank you. That’s great. Thank you. Wait-wait! Where on west 10th? Because there’s this really cute shoe store that has like this little…  Umm, our situation. Y’know umm, what we mean to each other. And I mean we-we’re having this baby together, and we live together. Isn’t that, isn’t that weird?  Oh.  No-no-no! No, no, no, we’re not married.  Oh yeah! Actually, that’s one of the reasons why we’re not a couple.  Oh. Oh yeah, don’t get to worked up over it. I mean it-it sounds like he’s a doctor, but he’s not.  Oh my God! I’m standing at a cash register, holding a credit card, and I’m bored.  Hi Pheebs!  Oh, it was great! We got everything that we needed! Oh and Ross, almost got something that wasn’t on the list. A whore.  Well, we were paying for our stuff and this saleswoman just started flirting with him.  Yeah.  You don’t understand! You didn’t see how brazen she was.  No! I’m not! I-I-I just think it’s wrong! It’s-it’s that I’m—Here I am about to pop and he’s out picking up some shop girl at Sluts ‘R’ Us!  Oh yeah! You really—You look great.  All this stuff takes up a lot of room. Hey how uh, how serious are you about keeping Ben in your life?  So you guys go, have a really good time.  So, you had a good day huh? Big commission; picked up a daddy.  Oh yeah! Yeah please, you guys have fun.  Oh and it was great to see you too. And you look fantastic, although you missed a button.  Oh okay, I see what you’re doing there.  Hi! You’re back from your date!  I’m fine, but that’s not important. What’s important is how was she?  Oh uh-huh, uh-huh, coffee, a little rub-rub-rub under the table.  No! No, she’s—She was nice. I mean, she’s a little slutty, but who isn’t?  Of course you did Ross, you would date a gorilla if it called you Indiana Jones!  No! It’s just that, Kate bothered me.  There was nothing wrong with her! All right? She was perfectly lovely!  I don’t want you to date her!  Yes! And not because I want you to go out with me, but because I don’t want you to go out with anybody! Okay? I know it’s a terrible thing to even think this, and it’s completely inappropriate, but I want you to be at my constant beck and call 24 hours a day! I’m very sorry, but that is just the way that I feel.  What?!  Really? But I’m being so unreasonable.  Uh-huh.  Oh no-no-no-no, no!  Yeah?  Hey you guys... You\\'re never gonna believe it. This headhunter called me. I have a meeting tomorrow with Gucci. Gucci wants me.  Congratulations!  Oh my God! That\\'s my boss. You have to seat us somewhere else.  But my... but my boss cannot see me. I\\'m interviewing for another job.  Sssshhhh!  Hi... I\\'m on a date...  Yeah, it is. Yeah, you know, it\\'s tough. Single mom, career... You gotta get out there.  Oh.  Yes, hi!  Wha... My resumé? I wouldn\\'t... I wouldn\\'t call my online dating profile a resumé.  What? I-I don\\'t.  No, I-I-I love it there.  Oh! It\\'s not good.  Well, I didn\\'t get the job at Gucci and I got fired from Ralph Lauren.  Well, my boss was at the same restaurant where I was having my interview and he heard everything. So later he calls me to his office and he tells me that he\\'s gonna have to let me go, because I\\'m not a team player. And I said \"Wait a minute! Yes I am.\" and I had to sit there for 45 minutes while he proved that that in fact... was true.  Oh it... good! Yeah, but I\\'m not gonna hear from that for a couple of days.  Ah, all right. Here\\'s to Ross!  Oh!  No, it\\'s okay, you didn\\'t know.  I\\'m fantastic. You remember Ross?  No, but it\\'s good, you know, I\\'m gonna take some time off and do some charity work.  Well, screw charity work. What\\'ve you got?  Great! I\\'ll call ya!  Ross! That\\'s Mark. From Bloomingdales? You were insanely jealous of him.  Yes.  Oh.  What? You don\\'t want me to get a job?  Ugh.  Oh, it was great. Mark is so sweet.  Oh Ross, come on. He\\'s happily married. His wife just had twins.  He offered me one.  I know, it\\'s amazing. It\\'s amazing. It\\'s so much better than what I had at Ralph Lauren. The money is great...  You may need to use this year to teach Ben about Phoebe.  Drums?  Joey, y’know that you could just not throw the sticks up in the air.  Oh, isn\\'t that adorable? Joey is afraid of the tarantula.  What? Wait-wait a minute, what? Phoebe, what\\'s the matter?  And that makes you angry because…  Where did you get that?  Phoebe?  Did you get all this stuff for Joey to try and drive me out of the apartment? Honey, if you wanted to do that, you might as well just gotten him a fish, you know how fish freaked me out!  It wouldn\\'t have mattered anyway, Phoebe, you and I are, are gonna live together, we\\'re roommates; that\\'s the deal.  Oh, it\\'s so much more fun with you.  We did!  Oh, I would love to!  Oh wow! Look at this place!  And remember how you always said you were afraid the landlord would find out and then tear it down?  See?  You can’t, because of the new skylight!  So what should we do? Should we start looking for a new place?  Oh yeah? Startin’ to feel her again there are we?  Pheebs is your grandmother maybe saying that you should live here alone?  Phoebe, it’s okay. I like living with Joey.  Oh please, I hate packing, it’s closer to work, and we do have fun. Although, I’m really gonna miss living with you.  Oh.  I got it!  Its back in cage!  Joey, would you just come out here and stop being such a baby!  No, no, no, no turtles scare me. I don\\'t need that today.  Oh honey, thank you, but Mark\\'s taking me out.  Oh.  Yeah. What kind of discount do we get?  Hi honey!  Oh, he\\'s just goofing around.  Oh honey, this is his office too. I told you we\\'re Joanna\\'s two assistants.  Oh! Oh my God! What did I just do?  Ow! Ross!!  Oh no, no-no-no, that\\'s not, not, not, what he is doing. He\\'s just, he\\'s just really romantic.  Yes.  All right Ross!! I get it!!  You\\'re hurt!  Oh, please, Ross it was so obvious! It was like you were marking your territory. I mean you might have well have just come in and peed all around my desk!  Look, I know what\\'s going on here, okay, Mark explained it all to me. He said this is what you guys do.  So ah, did you have fun at the bachelor party last night?  Right.  Hello.  A big idiot.  Honey, why is it hard, I mean we\\'ve been together for almost a year now?  Where ya going?  Ohh, with who?  You have a play date with a stripper?!  Sure, is she married?  Noo, I y\\'know I don\\'t see why she has to play with you, that\\'s all. I mean doesn\\'t she have any y\\'know other stripper moms friends of her own?  I\\'m not jealous. All right this is about, umm, people feeling certain things y\\'know about strippers. And y\\'know, and um, I...  Ugh. Wait, wait, wait.  Oh! Good thing Chandler’s not here, he always wins at this game.  My boss, Joanna? Wow, that must’ve been awkward.  What is she doing here?  I don’t understand! Last time you went out with her you said she was a ‘big, dull dud.’  Well, last time I almost got fired. You must end it, you must end it now!  Thank you.  That’s weird, she locked the door.  Okay, swear you won’t tell, but when Mark left he gave me a key to Joanna’s office. Do you wanna see the list?  You promised you would break up with her!  And the fact that you were jeopardising my career never entered your mind?!  Y\\'know what Chandler, you got yourself into those cuffs, you get yourself out of them.  You never come into this office again!  You give me back my Walkman!  Well, then I lost it. You buy me one!  Does it hurt?  Wait a minute! What are you gonna tell Joanna?  When she sees that you’re gone, she’s gonna know that I let you out, and that I was in here, and I’m gonna get fired!  Chandler! Chandler, please, I have to get you locked up back the way you were, I am sooo gonna lose my job, she’s very private about her office. Now I know why.  What if I clean your bathroom for a month?  Foot rubs for a month!  I’ll take all of your photos and put them into photo albums!  Sophie sit!!  No! God, would you just calm down!  I ah, will buy and wrap all of your Christmas gifts.  I ah… Oh! I’ll squeeze you fresh orange juice every morning!  I have so got it. There’s gonna be rumours about this, there’s no way to stop it. Sophie knows, Monica and Phoebe know.  I can make you a legend. I can make you this generation’s Milton Berle.  So did you break up with Joanna?  What?!  It’s me! Good morning!  Oh, yeah! Yeah!  Okay.  Awww, no, it\\'s okay, we\\'ve actually known for a while.  Well, Ross, we were worried about you. We didn\\'t know how you were going to react.  Oh! Oh, I just thought of the greatest wedding gift to get you.  Okay.  She is so cute! You could fit her right in your little pocket!  Hmm. Look, Ross, if you want your neighbors to like you, why don\\'t you just pay the hundred bucks? The party\\'s gonna cost you way more than that.  Okay, I thought it was about your neighbors liking you.  And that crazy party animal will be your brother-in-law.  Umm, Chandler, you do realize that those ideas are probably already in Monica\\'s head.  Well, because she loves you and because you love her.  Hey, Chandler, don\\'t freak out! I\\'m telling you something you already know! Come on, she broke up with Richard because he didn\\'t want to have babies. And she\\'s a woman, and she\\'s almost 30, and y\\'know it\\'s Monica.  No, you\\'re right, you are absolutely right. I mean that makes, that makes everything different.  Not unless different means the same.  Hi! Wow! You look, you look…big.  Uhhh, yeah. But it\\'s not obvious why.  Hey! Hey, cute jacket!  Oh no wait Pheebs, I think for something like that you just ask them to move in with you. But I\\'m not sure, Chandler?  Hi! Emma will be up in a minute!  Oh hey Ross... Listen, I heard about you and Charlie. I\\'m really sorry.  Absolutely.  So, uhm... what are you gonna do today?  Oh my God, what!?  Ok, look, Ross. I do not want Emma going to the playground.  Ok, fine! You can make fun of me. I do not want Emma going there. And I was thinking Claire Danes.  Ross, those things go like 40 miles an hour! Ok? When you\\'re... and there is that moment when you are at the top, when you just don\\'t know if you\\'re gonna return back to earth!  All right!  Irrational, huh? All right, well, I’ll remember that the next time you freak out about a spider in your apartment!  Ok, careful.  Careful, watch her hair. WATCH HER HAIR!  Ok.  Ok.  Oh, oh Ross, oh my God, are you okay?  Ross, see! I told you, those swings are evil! Alright, that is it. That is  Ross, c\\'mon, please. Can we just get out of here, before somebody else gets  Alright fine. I\\'ll do it.  If you hold a spider.  IF you hold a spider.  Ok... I got a spider. There were two, I picked the bigger one.  whoo... ok... wow... ok... OH!  A-alright! I can do this.  That\\'s because he\\'s on your neck.  ROSS!  So Mac and C.H.E.E.S.E.  Joey, what are you talking about? You’re a terrific actor.  Ugh, how can you even ask that question?!   I\\'m sorry, what?  Of course he will! But Chandler the most important thing is you forgive yourself!  Already? That’s pretty bad what you did.  I’m sure he will forgive you. Look, we have all been there! Y’know, you fight, you make up, it’s just the way it works.  Yeah! You and that girl from that copy place, which yesterday you took full responsibility for!!  What?!!  Y\\'know I can’t believe I even thought about getting back together again! We are so over!!  And hey! Just so you know, it’s not that common! It doesn’t happen to every guy! And it is a big deal!!  That is the most ridiculous...  I did not sell you out.  Fine!  Hey, nice toilet.  OK, here we go. Honey, I\\'m sorry, they were all out of apple pie, someone just got the last piece.  Oh God. Ross, OK, if you care about me at all, you will get the pie out of the man\\'s hood.  Pie in the hood, pie in the hood. Go.  What\\'s goin\\' on?  Well, you\\'re not sixteen, you\\'re both adults now.  Or ya know, he\\'s rubber and you\\'re glue.  Look, Chandler, he has moved on, OK, you have to too.  It\\'ll never last, he\\'s just a rebound roommate.  Pretty uhm, different huh?  Would you guys stop.  Oh my God.  Well, how did you find out?  OK, Phoebs. But what about you?  Wow! What did he do?  I can’t. I’m busy. I’m apartment hunting.  Well, I haven’t discussed it with him yet, but I know he’s gonna be relieved. Last week, he brought this girl over and I started talking to her about morning sickness and then I showed her pictures from my pregnancy book.  Not so much.  Oh my God! Was she old? Does she have a view?  Yeah that would really be great.  Well can we see it?! Oh maybe we shouldn’t. I mean if she just died this morning out of respect.  Shall we?  And I’m Rachel, an admirer of the building.  Ahh.  So she’s really not dead.  Hmm. Do you think—Could you tell me if she’s hanging in, in a one bedroom or a two?  Hey!  How was the game?  Oh.  Oh yeah! Hopefully across the street if certain Dutch people would just let go.  Oh but Joey, I have to go. There’s no room for a baby here.  Honey, it’s not just a matter of where you put it. I mean a baby changes everything. They cry all the time. I mean imagine bringing home some girl and trying to score when there’s a screaming baby around.  Honey, it’s so sweet that you want me to stay, but I-I can’t do that to you. I mean it would disrupt your entire life.  I know.  I do too a little bit.  Hi!  You gave them to me!  All right, I took them. But I figured it would be okay because you got a big ink stain on the crotch.  What bra?  What is this?  But Joey the baby is going to be crying, it’s going to be loud.  It’s gonna be up all night!  It’s gonna poop!  What about all the women you want to bring home?  Joey, are you sure?  I want me to stay too.  Are you serious—Really?! It’s in such good condition.  Wow! Whoa-whoa what’s under the covers?  It’s moving.  Ewww. Yeah. Umm. I think I’m gonna stay here.  You know, I\\'m thinking about letting Emma have her first cookie.  I\\'ve never given her a cookie. Have you?  Of course, I\\'d be honored!  OH! What\\'s it the anniversary of? Your first date, your first kiss, first time you had sex...  So now, what are you doing here?  God!  Oh, I know, isn\\'t she?  All right. What\\'s your news, Amy?  What? Oh my God! To who?  A-And??  No, what\\'s he like?  Yeah.  Huh... wow, so he\\'s gotta be...  Sweety, I gotta tell ya... it sounds a little bit like you like the apartment more than you like...  Oh... sit down, sit down. Oh, honey, you know, I once also almost married somebody that I didn’t love. Do you remember Barry?  Ok.  Ok, let’s keep talking.  Amy, hi!  Oh, good for you!  Yes you are! Oh, I am so proud of you!  But Erin Brockovich had her own house.  Yeah... Amy kept kicking me in her sleep yelling ‘Myron, get off!’  Joey, I can’t do that!  Well Joey, uhm look, I know that she’s difficult, but I think it’s really good that she’s here.  No, it\\'s just... look, you know, when I first moved to the city I was a lot like her! I was spoiled, self-centered and you guys really took care of me.  Well, uhm... whatever, I have really appreciated it, \\'cause I don’t think I would be the person that I am today if it wasn’t for you guys. See, I wanna help Amy the way you guys helped me. And I know it’s gonna take patience, but that’s ok.  Amy, that’s what I was supposed to wear today, that’s why I hung it on the door.  Amy, you know what? I was thinking that maybe now it\\'d be a good time for us to sit down and, you know, talk about your future.  Well, what happened?  Oh, that is so tacky.  Phoebe, that’s huge!  I think it could be kind of great!  Menstrual cramps.  Yeah.  Why not?  Ross, I am trying to help her become a better person. This is a huge breakthrough for her! She just offered to do something for another human being!!  Absolutely.  You pierced her ears? How could you do this without telling me?  Oh my God, Oh my God, here comes Ross. He\\'s gonna flip out.  Nah, I don\\'t really want her to see.  Nothing.  Oh, they\\'re real!  I can\\'t believe this. All I wanted to do was help you try to figure out what to do with your life and this is how you repay me?  Oh yeah? Since when?  Joey, get Amy\\'s bags, she is moving out!  You put holes in my baby\\'s ears!  Excuse me?  Hips or thighs?  Yeah. I just, I kept trying to make you a better person, but you\\'re... you\\'re already a pretty perfect version of what you are.  Did you just say Emma?  So how is the uhm... baby styling business going?  That\\'s shocking!  I am so proud of Joey, I can\\'t believe he\\'s going to be on Law & Order!  No because first they arrest the guy and then they try him.  What\\'s going on?  Ross! We broke up two years ago; you\\'ve been married since then. I think it\\'s okay that we see other people.  Hm-mmm.  Okay, y\\'know what? We don\\'t need her measurements.  Big night!  Oh what, you-you want both of them?  Okay, okay, okay, look, just don\\'t freak out, but I kinda lost it. I know it\\'s in the apartment, but I definitely lost it.  Tell her to wear her own earrings.  Nooo! Nooooo! You lent me Monica\\'s earrings?! I\\'m not allowed to borrow her stuff!  Because I lose her stuff!  Oh boy, I just can\\'t watch. It\\'s too scary!  Oh yeah well, you know me, babies, responsibilities, ahhh!!!  Uhh, no, no, it bothered me when he slept with other women.  But y\\'know, I never really had anything to worry about. Ross was never very good at the flirting thing.  Oh! Y\\'know what? You\\'re right! We meet, you flirted and then bamn nine years later you had me!  Ohh! Thank God! Where was it?  Okay that is the one we already have!  Wait a minute. Chandler has a jewelry box?  I don\\'t know, I don\\'t know.  Oh gosh, she\\'s going to kill me.  Ohh that\\'d be great!  Your sunglasses?!  I\\'m sorry.  No. No. Every thing\\'s--they\\'re fine. Great pizza. But it\\'s uh, actually umm my friend Ross. He uh, just gets really nervous when he\\'s flirting.  Yeah.  I know, I know, but uh just, I\\'m telling you, once, once you get past that part, that where it-it just feels like you wanna die, he\\'s-he\\'s really a good person.  Yeah. I\\'m-I\\'m telling you he\\'s really sweet and he\\'s really funny and he\\'s just ugh, got a good heart. And besides, I y\\'know, I think he really likes you.  Well y\\'know, we have 7 people and like 10 pizzas, what do you think?  Yeah!  I-I-I didn\\'t! I didn\\'t! She thought you were cute.  Yay!  Oh, that is so sick.  Y\\'know, it was, uh.. it was actually really great. He took me to lunch at the Russian Tea Room, and I had that chicken, where y\\'know you poke it and all the butter squirts out...  Then we took a walk down to Bendall\\'s, and I told him not to, but he got me a little bottle of Chanel...  Right,.. well,.. we never actually got to that... Oh, it was just so nice to see him again, y\\'know? It was comfortable, it was familiar... it was just nice!  Yeah, but it was different with him today! And he wasn\\'t, like, Orthodontist Guy, y\\'know? I mean, we had fun! Is there anything wrong with that?  Why?  All right. All right, all right, all right, all right, I know it\\'s stupid! I will go see him this afternoon, and I will just put an end to it!  Wow... Wow!  I\\'m not crazy, right? I mean, it was never like that.  Ooh, and it\\'s so nice having this little sink here...  Oh, it\\'s just... Oh, Barry, this was not good.  Well, what about Mindy?  No, not that, I mean, what about you and Mindy?  No. No-no-no-no, no. I mean, don\\'t do that. Not, I mean not for me.  Oh, Barry..! Come on, this is all way too..  I had a bra.  What?!  Oh, do I?  I don\\'t know! I mean, we still care about each other. There\\'s a history there. \\'S\\'like you and Carol.  Please. If she said to you, \"Ross, I want you on this couch, right here, right now,\" what would you say?  Get down?  Thanks, but I gotta go to work and get my eyes scratched out by Mindy.  Please. I haven\\'t heard from her in seven months, and now she calls me? I mean, what else is it about? Oh! She was my best friend, you guys! We went to camp together... she taught me how to kiss..  And now, y\\'know, I\\'m like... I\\'m like the other woman! I feel so..  Right, I\\'ll see you guys later...  Mindy.  Hey, you.... So, what\\'s up?  Sure we should... So.  Okay.  Of course!  Was that all you wanted to ask me?  Oh sure it is!  Um, what- what would make you think that?  What? What\\'s what you were afraid of?  What?  Uh... Oh, Mindy, you are so stupid. Oh, we are both so stupid.  Oh, I am so sorry.  Hey. Got a second?  Uh, we are here to break up with you.  Uh- which one of us are you talking to there, Barr?  Even when we were having sex in that chair?  Please! During that second time you couldn\\'t have picked her out of a lineup!  Well, the first time didn\\'t really count... I mean, y\\'know, \\'s\\'Barry.  Okay. Okay, we\\'ll be here! Hating you! Did you see how he was sweating when he walked out of there? Listen honey, if I\\'m hogging the ball too much you just jump right in there and take a couple punches because I\\'m telling you, this feels great.  What are you talking about?! Mindy, the guy is the devil! He\\'s Satan in a smock!  Oh God.  And I hope Barry doesn\\'t kill you and eat you in Aruba.  Yeah.  Yeah! Y\\'know, ever since I ran out on Barry at the wedding, I have wondered whether I made the right choice. And now I know.  You don\\'t know?!  How?! How do you know?  Oh, I so wanted Ross to know first, but I’m so relieved you guys know.  Okay. Great! So now that you guys all know you can help me. Give me some advice on how I’m gonna tell Ross!  Well I was gonna tell him that I’m-I’m gonna have the baby and he can be as involved as he wants.  You do?  Seriously. What?!  Okay, y’know what? Can I, can I talk now?  I know. I know, but y’know condoms only work like 97% of the time.  They do!  Okay Ross come on let’s just forget about the condoms.  Listen, y’know what? I was really freaked out too when I found out…  Y’know what? Let’s, let’s talk later.  Uh-uh-uh, right now? Because I’ve kinda got an el fresco situation going on over here.  Okay Ross that’s fine, but can you please stand near my head?  Okay. Head Ross! Head Ross! Head Ross!  What married?  What, because that’s your answer to everything?  Yeah, maybe if you’re in love. But Ross, we are not in love, are we?  Excuse me?  What?!  I can too eat by myself!  When certain people leave the table and I am not finished!  Oh please, you inhale your food!  Oh no Dr. Long, please come in. This is Ross, he is the father.  I do need you! I need you to stand near my head!  Wow. There it is, I see it.  Okay.  I don’t see it!  I can’t see it!  I know, I lied! I didn’t want her to think I was a terrible mother! I can’t even see my own baby!  Oh. Oh, it’s beautiful. I see it now.  No, I don’t see it!  Yeah.  That’s it? Well I saw that! Ohh-ohh-oh, thank you.  Wow! I can’t believe that’s our baby.  Hi.  Oh, everything went great.  Since when do take naps in that position. Oh God Monica, tell me you were waiting for a guy! Please tell me you were waiting for a guy!  Why aren\\'t you guys at the movie?  So Chandler, have you heard about Monica\\'s secret boyfriend?  So Mon, when are we gonna meet this new secret waiter man?  I don’t care! I wanna meet this guy who\\'s the best sex she ever had!  What-what-what are you gonna do?  Maybe Joey\\'s right. Maybe all good deeds are selfish.  For Stella! Remember? She\\'s gettin\\' her grove back in like 20 minutes.  Sure. I guess. Hey, I hear you don\\'t have to go to London. Yay!  Like what?  Well, why don\\'t you talk to me about it, maybe I can help.  Well, I-I know you can do that too. I\\'m just, I\\'m just saying if you need somebody to talk to… Hi!  No Mon, you want to put them in concentric circles. I want to do this.  Oh! That would be sooo much fun!  Let’s do it! Ross?  Do you wanna play football?  Um, there was a Geller Cup?  Wait no, honey, honey throw it to me, throw it to me.  Monica, I’m your best friend.  Ross!  You don’t pick me! You’re stuck with me!  Over here!  Wait, what am I gonna do?  Wait, how long?  Okay.  Yeah, I know, go long. Y\\'know, it’s like all I’m doing is running back and forth from the huddle.  Can I see that for second.  Now, does it really matter?  All right, so are we not having dinner at all?  I went really long.  I can not believe your trading me!!  Are you gonna let me play?  Yeah!!! Kill ‘um!!!  No! Come on! Don’t make me go long. Use me. They never cover me.  God, I’m not lame, okay. I can do something. I can throw, would you let me throw, come on this is my game too.  Thank you! Break!  I’m so sorry! Are you okay?  I’m sorry, they were just all coming at me, and I didn’t know what to do.  We should defiantly play football more often. Maybe there’s a like league we could join or something.  Oh shoot! I work Monday nights.  That is so cool.  Ross gave it to me.  Ohh, thank you.  Well excuse me, my fashion-impaired friends, I am here to tell you that hats are back.  Oh yeah, now everybody wants to be under this hat!  Come on, please?! I’m boredddd! You let me do it once before.  Just once!  Take it like a man, Ross!  Oh, come on!  Really?!  Oh, yeah.  I’m just making margaritas.  What?!  Oh, come on!  Monica, please?  Well I assume the ah, happy couple isn’t up yet. Did you guys hear them last night?  Oh, great.  I’m going for a walk.  Oh, ah nothin’. I just felt like hangin’ out here and reading.  Ohhhh, sorry I missed that.  Ohh-ha-ha!  Y\\'know, I gotta tell ya, I just loved your look when you were bald.  Ohh!  Really?!  I mean you definitely should do that.  Yeah!  Awww, stop. Come on. Now go shave that head!  Aww Pheebs, that sucks!  Hi!  That was her idea, I just gave her a nudge.  Hey!  Come on see, she doesn’t look that bad.  I don’t know.  All right! Ross, do you think it’s easy for me to see you with somebody else?  Yeah, because I was mad at you, not because I stopped loving you!  Noo.  Oh, y-yeah, so, you-you love me!  Noo! Maybe! I, I don’t know. Ross, I still can’t forgive you for what you did, I can’t, I just, but sometimes when I’m with you I just, I feel so...  I just, I feel, I-I just...  I feel...  We are looking at a Playboy.  Oh, yeah, sure. I mean, like in the case of this young woman, she has lost her clothes, so she rides naked on the horse, she’s crying out, ‘Where are they, where are they?’  You see, now, I would date this girl. She’s cute, she’s outdoorsy, you know, and she knows how to build a fire. I mean, that’s got to come in handy  Monica, what are you doing?  What? Wait a minute. What are you saying, that I’m a pushover? I’m not a pushover.  I cannot believe her.  Oh, oh, I love that Japanese place.  All right, wherever you wanna go is cool.  No.  Joey, honey, I don’t think you’re supposed to go back there.  Come on, Joey, I did it and it was fine.  Phoebe. We would like to talk to you for a second.  Yes, we are very sorry to tell you this, but you, Phoebe, are flaky.  So, what, you’re just, you’re just okay with being flaky?  Yeah, and I am okay with being a pushover.  I am not a pushover!  Wow, you know what? That is the best fake speech I think I’ve ever heard.  How-how did you lose your job here?  He left work in the middle of the day to do a personal errand and left you in charge when you’ve been working here two days? That’s not, that’s not right.  What?  That’s right, he can have his job back. I’m glad we got that all straightened out. There you go, Joey, you got your job back.  Yeah, pretty nice, huh? Now who’s a pushover?  Oh, yeah. Definitely you, Pheebs.  Hey. Oh, I have a question. If-if-if one of you had to pick one of the other two guys to go out with, who would you pick?  Hi!  No.  Wow! I don’t remember him. Honey, are you sure you’re not talking about your imaginary boyfriend.  Oh that’s nice.  Remember I had to leave the room the other day when you had that roast chicken?  Hi! Will, right?  Hi! I’m Rachel Green.  Really?! Aren’t you sweet! I gotta tell you though, I am, I am having the hardest time placing you. Oh-oh hang on! Did we umm, did we fool around at Lance Davis’ graduation party?  Thank you!  All right, who would uh, like some yams? Will?  I’m sorry. What?  Umm, I’m sorry. Do you-do you have a problem with me?  I’m-I’m—I had no idea. I’m sorry. I…  Uh Will umm, I just want to say that I’m real sorry for whatever I-I did to you in high school…  You had a club?!  Whoa! My God! So what, you all just joined together to hate me?! Who else was in this club?  So who else was in this club?  So Ross, we went out for two years, and you never told me you were in an I Hate Rachel club.  Okay Monica, did you know about this?!  Okay. So what? You guys would just like get together and like just say mean things about me?  What rumor?  Ross!  What?!  Monica, how come you never told me this?!  Joey stop staring! There’s nothing there! It’s not true!  Yes!  I don’t care how long ago it was! You told people that I was half and half! Y’know what? I just want to point out I never did anything to hurt you in high school.  What?  Yes it is! I saw you guys going at it behind the card catalog!  Ohh, there’s a picture of her in the yearbook actually.  Wh—Phoebe!!  Wow…  She’s right.  You can keep those pants by the way.  Please tell me you’re not gonna dress up like a dinosaur.  Hi!  I am! I am a woman who spent a lot of money on a dress and she wants to wear it, because soon she won’t be able to fit into it.  Ahh!  Okay.  Oh! Oh! Can I give out the candy? I really want to be with the kids right now. Y’know, ever since I got pregnant I-I have the strongest maternal instincts.  Oh wow! That deserves another piece of candy.  Well, I have to say that earns tutu pieces of candy.  Yeah I know, but one of them just said that she loved me so I just gave her everything.  Hey.  Hi! Y’know what honey, we’re actually out of candy right now. But someone just went out to get some and I have been giving out money but I’m out of that too. Hey, can I write you a check?  Okay, what’s your name?  Okay, I’m just gonna write this out to cash.  Hey Mona!  Oh Gunther! You brought candy! Thank you so much for picking this up! You are so sweet.  Honey, someday you are gonna make some man the luckiest guy in the world.  Oh yeah, we were but umm, now we’ve got candy.  Well, that-that’s not your choice. Happy Halloween!  Well is it fair that all you did was put on a cape and I gotta give you free stuff?  You shut up!  Uh, I think I just did. And uh-oh, here it comes again. Shut up!  Hey! Well, I had to give the kid fifty bucks to stop crying.  No, I also had to go to a couple houses with him as his girlfriend. Oh, I am just awful with children!  Really? You think that’s all it is?  Hey!  Ohh, thank God! Finally!  Ohh, it\\'s me and La Poo! Wow! I miss that dog.  Great! Thanks!  Okay.  Oops. Sorry! Well, good thing you number all of them, huh?  Ohhhh. Honey, honey, honey, it\\'s okay, it\\'s okay honey. I\\'m gonna fix you a drink, huh? Maybe a margarita?  No honey, it\\'s okay! Listen, I\\'ll got to Ross\\'s and get the blender, you get all the margarita stuff ready.  Okay, you want me to stop at the ATM?  What?!  Hey! What\\'s up?!  So all we have is ice?  Okay.  What?! We can\\'t do that!  Noo! Oh no! No! God no! He should not get back together with her. I know that! You know that! Even Ross knows that! But that still doesn’t give us the right to erase his message!  I don\\'t think he\\'s the one who needs help.  Ugh!  Noooooooo!  No, wait. Wait.  No, Monica! Monica! We have to fix this!  Yeah well unless we tell him.  Oh, maybe that\\'s Emily calling back to leave the exact same message.  Right?  Hey! Hi!  Hey! Y\\'know what? You are in our apartment all the time! Okay? This is, this is just a drop in the bucket mister!  Okay, just a little scared. What\\'s going on Ross?  What?! What? What happened?!  Yeah!  Because a car backfired?  Well, I-I-I don\\'t know how this fits into your whole \"seizing\" thing but um, Emily called you today.  Well, uh something about having second thoughts about the wedding and did you guys make a mistake breaking up and uh, she wants you to call her.  Now, that-that was a good thing that I told you, right?  Okay, no, that\\'s not the right decision. That\\'s not, that\\'s not right, no Ross-Ross, come on! I mean, that woman made you miserable! Okay, Ross, do you really want to get back into that?  Ugh, Ross! That was not a near death experience! That was barely an experience!  Okay, y\\'know what? Maybe, this is not about seizing stuff. Maybe this is about escaping stuff.  Well, there you go!  Oh?  Yeah.  Who is it?  Hide my rings.  Oh. <opens door preparing herself and then happily says>  Um... hi.  Aw.  I haven\\'t seen you in like.. a year.  Oh well yeah me too. Um.. I had a baby.  Oh.. yeah? Well unless you pushed a desk out of your vagina, <shakes head no> not the same thing.  mh hmm..  Uh.... its Emma.  Oh Amy, you remember Ross.  Amy! <pause> Yes I do.. I really do. <grabs Ross\\' hand for support>  Yeah, no. Ross has a PhD.  God she is unbelievable.  Oh sure Ross, yeah. If I have a heart attack in a restaurant, I want you there with your fossil brush.  What? What happened?  Oh Amy, don\\'t cry Amy.  Um.. Ross, could I talk to you in private?  Um look I was thinking.. If its ok with Monica I would like to invite Amy to Thanksgiving.  Look I know she\\'s a little tough to take. She has no where else to go, and she\\'s my sister. Alright, she\\'s Emma\\'s aunt. And I would like them to bond.  Ross, you know what? She may need one..We\\'re just going to have to make our peace with that!  Hey you guys, this is my sister Amy.  This is Chandler, Joey, Phoebe and you know Mon.  Oh we just put her down for a nap.  Honey, I don\\'t know how to tell you this, but um, if something were to happen to Ross or to myself <Ross and Rachel knock on wood> um you wouldn\\'t get the baby.  See look Amy, we\\'re a lot closer to Monica and Chandler. We see them every day. And truthfully honey, you don\\'t seem very connected to the baby.  Monica is Ross\\' sister.  Hey. Amy. You\\'ve got to stop doing that.  Well actually...  Honey, you\\'re taking this the wrong way. We think you\\'re going to be a wonderful parent. It\\'s just.. you\\'re more the fun parent.  UCHH! <much louder and longer then Amy\\'s>  Yeah.. yeah right.. Remember in high school when I died and didn\\'t give you my baby?  What? What carrer?  Ok. You decorate dad\\'s office and so now you\\'re a decorator. Okay! I went to the zoo yesterday and now I\\'m a koala bear.  Sup.. You want to talk supportive? You didn\\'t even come and visit me when I was in the hospital having the baby.  I did the first time! Oh. Oh.. <gets up and walks into the kitchen> And you know what. You want to know why I\\'m not giving Emily to you.  uh huh.  Jealous of what? Of your lack of responsiblity? You, your immaturity? Your total disregard of other people\\'s feelings?  Timmy was my boyfriend and you made out with him!  I cannot, I cannot believe that I invited you here today.  ah ha ha. ah ha ha. <evil meancing laughter> It\\'s forty five.  You take that back.  Take it back!  Heey man, I work out.  I do pilates.  Bring it on!  Did you just push me?  Alright. Thats it! <Pushes Amy back>  Ew! Gross.  Mon, I\\'m so sorry.  Are you okay Mon?  Look Amy, it got a little of control..Um.. and I\\'m sorry. You\\'re my sister and uh.. if it really means that much to you..  Uh. No.. I was going to let you use my Ralph Lauren discount.  She needs changing.  Do what, do what?  No! Phoebes! Don\\'t you remember why you dumped the guy?  Well, what are you guys doing tomorrow night?  Ok, ok, Roger was creepy, but he was nothing compared to Pete Carney.  How did we end up with these jerks? We\\'re good people!  Pheebes, this woman is voluntarily bald.  Or?  Burning\\'s good. Yeah, I got stuff to burn.  Oh my god. Janice, hi!  Oh, Joey, look who it is.  Ok, Pheebs, you know what, if we had that, we wouldn\\'t be doing the ritual in the first place.  And here we have the last of Paulo\\'s grappa.  Really?  So, um, will you bring the truck?  Oh, my god.  Oh, they\\'re firemen guys.  I\\'m sorry, what?  That\\'s great!  What do you mean?  Ok, who ordered what?  Oh god.  I know, but it\\'s just it\\'s the first time, and I just don\\'t want her to think that because I didn\\'t marry Barry, that my life is total crap, you know?  Mom!  Pretty much.  This is Joey, and Phoebe, and this is Chandler, and you remember Ross.  Oh Mom!  Really?  Yeah, well just be glad he\\'s not playing a smaller instrument.  I know. And Mom, I realize you and Daddy were upset when I didn\\'t marry Barry and get the big house in the suburbs with all the security and everything, but this is just so much better for me, you know?  For...me.  Well, what do you mean?  Oh god. I think I\\'m gonna be sick.  None.  No! They didn\\'t even talk to each other. God, how was I supposed to know they were having problems?  I just can\\'t believe this is happening. I mean, when I was little, everybody\\'s parents were getting divorced. I just figured as a grownup I wouldn\\'t have to worry about this.  Well, then, you know, couldn\\'t she have just copied my haircut?  These are from Halloween three years ago.  No, that was his costume. See, he\\'s actually an orthodontist, but he came as a regular dentist.  Actually, what I think you said was, \"don\\'t touch that, and get the hell out of my kitchen.\"  Hey, Mon, you want some help?  She\\'s still with you?  God!  Oh! What\\'s new in sex?  Oh, I\\'m sorry. You know what? I cannot have this conversation with you. I mean, god, you just come in here, and drop this bomb on me, before you even tell Daddy. What? What do you want? Do you want my blessing?  You want me to talk you out of it?  Then what? What do you want?  Why on earth would I understand this?  Oh.  Hey, Mom? Having fun?  There\\'s more alcohol, right?  I had a wedding.  Oh. Right. ...Oh great.  Country club newsletter. My mother sends me the engagement notices for \\'inspiration.\\' Oh my God! Oh my God, it\\'s Barry and Mindy!  Barry who I almost.  Mindy, my maid of. Oh!  What?  Oh, I\\'m sorry. Oh, this is so stupid! I mean, I gave Barry up, right? I should be happy for them! I am, I\\'m happy for them.  No. Oh, oh, I guess it would be different if I were- with somebody.  Oh, I don\\'t know. I guess it\\'s not about no guys, it\\'s about the right guy, y\\'know? I mean, with Barry, it was safe and it was easy, but there was no heat. With Paolo, that\\'s all there was, was heat! And it was just this raw, animal, sexual...  Well, I mean, do you think you can ever have both? Y\\'know? Someone who\\'s like, who\\'s like your best friend, but then also can make your toes curl?  Hi, how was the movie?  I don\\'t know. We were watching TV, and then he pooped in Monica\\'s shoe-  I don\\'t know. The left one.  Oh. Oh, those little clunky Amish things you think go with everything.  C\\'mon, you guys, what\\'re we gonna do, what\\'re we gonna do?  Oh, my, God, c\\'mon, you guys! He\\'s gonna be home any minute! He\\'s gonna kill me!  Well, what\\'m I gonna do? What\\'m I gonna do?  Anybody wanna trade? Oh...  Great! It went great. Really great. Hey, is that wine?  Oh, I would love some. But y\\'know what? Y\\'know what? Let\\'s not drink it here. I\\'m feeling kinda crazy. You wanna go to Newark?  Oh God, Ross, I cannot do this.  Oh God... Okay. Alright. Alright. Okay. Ross, please don\\'t hate me.  Y\\'know Marcel?  Well, I kind of... I kind of lost him.  I know, I know, I\\'m sorry-  See? I\\'ve even called Animal Control!  Uh-huh... why... do you not like them?  O-okay, now see, you never ever ever told us that...  Hi, thanks for coming.  Turned out it was a hat.  Cat! What\\'m I saying? Cat!  Yeah!  Luisa? Oh my God! Monica! It\\'s Luisa!  Yes!!  None.  What?!  Marcel?  Ross, you don\\'t know that.  Y\\'know, it is not like I did this on purpose.  Ross.  Ross.  Ross!  Then what\\'s with all the bananas?  Oh, c\\'mon, Luisa!  Alright. In high school I was the prom queen and I was the homecoming queen and the class president and you... were also there! But if you take this monkey, I will lose one of the most important people in my life. You can hate me if you want, but please do not punish him. C\\'mon, Luisa, you have a chance to be the bigger person here! Take it!  Alright. Well then how about I call your supervisor, and I tell her that you shot my friend in the ass with a dart?  Y\\'know, with the right pair of pumps, that would be a great little outfit.  Oh, Ross, c\\'mon. It\\'s my fault, I almost lost your...  That\\'d be good.  Barry?!  Good! ‘Cause I’ve got a product report to read, it’s like eight pages, I hope I don’t fall asleep.  Why? I love that thing.  Something to do with numbers?  What?  You mean the mom you met in Montauk. She was a cat?!  Umm, when were you gonna tell me that you’re going out with Chip Matthews?  Nooo! It’s not okay! I can’t believe you would want to after what he did to me!  Monica! I couldn’t find him for two hours! He was having sex with Amy Welch!  I mean why, of all people would you want to go out with Chip?!  Okay, that doesn’t help me, because we went to the same high school.  Yeah. Just, if it’s possible, could you leave him somewhere and go have sex with another guy?  I believe it.  Yes, I do.  Oh sure I am, because you always have to be right.  Jurassic Park could happen.  You guys, there’s a little girl in Soho looking for this cat. I mean, you know what that means?!  Do we have to tell her?  I hate when Ross is right!  Pheebs...  All right!!  Jeez!  Hello, Chip.  I’m great! I’m great. I’ve got a great job at Bloomingdale’s, have wonderful friends, and eventhough I’m not seeing anyone right now, I’ve never felt better about myself.  She’ll be out in a second. So, Chip, how’s umm, Amy Welch?  Wow! They really got you guys. Your T.V. The chairs.  Um-hmm.  Oh honey, I’m sorry.  Ohh! That’s so great!  You could.... say you’re sorry to her mom.  So honey, what are you gonna do about the little girl?  I’ll go with you.  Hi, sweetie!  I’ve got some bad news.  I can get a quick bite to eat, but then I have to come back up here.  Nooo, he’s leaving for a better job.  Well we’re gonna miss you around here.  Yeah, you bet.  Funny book?  Yeah, at the lecture, I told you that last week, you said you didn’t mind.  Oh, please tell me it’s not because I’m going with Mark.  Oh my God!!! Ross!!  Because, he’s my friend.  Okay, well if I stop playing with Joey and Chandler, can I play with Mark?  I don’t know, you thought ‘See you Saturday’ was funny. Look honey, Mark is in fashion okay, I like having a friend that I can share this stuff with. You guys would never want to go to a lecture with me.  Really!?  Nodded off!! Ross you were snoring. My father’s boat didn’t make that much noise when it hit rocks!  Well okay, how about four hours in a freezing museum auditorium listening to Professor Pitstains and he’s ‘Hey everybody! Remember that thing that’s been dead for a gazillion years. Well there’s this little bone we didn’t know it had!’  Okay, see now, what I just heard: blah-blah-blah, blah-blah-blah-blah-blah, blah-blah-blah, blah, blah.  Oh, that is so...  Y\\'know if what I do is so lame, then why did you insist on coming with me this morning? Huh? Was it so I just wouldn’t go with Mark?  Honey see, it doesn’t mean that I don’t love you. Because I do. I love you, I love you so much. But my work it’s-it’s for me y\\'know, I’m out there, on my own, and I’m doing it and it’s scary but I love it, because it’s mine. I, but, I mean is that okay?  What?!!  Well, my eye is a little itchy.  Richard? I\\'m not gonna go see your ex-boyfriend!  Well, I\\'m sorry I\\'m not going to an eye doctor!  Chandler!  Just stop it! Come on!  Oh my God! What does that thing do?  All right, I\\'m outta here!  Hey!  So were done then!  Okay.  Uh-huh.  Okay.  All right.  Uh-huh.  Okay.  Okay. Okay!  Yeah, no, I don\\'t-I don\\'t put things in my eye.  Great!  Y\\'know, I-I gotta tell ya, those eye drops are a miracle. My eye is a 100% better.  Damn!  Bye you guys!  Oh honey, I\\'ll say good-bye to you at the car if you don\\'t mind the puss.  Oh, did you beat him at a board game? He turns into such a baby when he starts to lose.  Eh! Stop it!  Okay, then y\\'know what? Help me! I need help! I can\\'t do this!  All right!  All right.  Yes!  Okay.  Really?!  Okay!  Great!  Okay.  Well, well, you said it was practice!  Because I knew you were lying!  Oh my God! You really are freakishly strong!  Monica! Stop it!  Yep!  What?!! Stop it! Stop it! Oh my God!  Joey.  So uh…I guess we should…make it official huh?  Hey you.  Uh yeah, actually I kinda need to talk to you too.  I know, I still need to talk to you.  Hi.  Uhh… I think I just got engaged.  Well…did you know he was gonna ask me?  And you really think this is a good idea?  I just don’t know! It just doesn’t feel right.  Really?! Even Ross?  I guess so.  I can’t say that I’m surprised.  Of course! Oh Joey, this ring I…it’s beautiful I love it!  Hey!  Yeah! Hi Emma. Hey, why do you think she won’t take my breast?  Okay sweetie, you can do it. Just open up and put it in your mouth.  I’m sorry honey, what were you saying?  It’s just so frustrating! Why doesn’t she want my breast?!  Hey. I need to tell you something.  Joey asked me marry him.  Joey proposed to me.  Well, I-I said yes.  I know. Days of Our Lives, thank you very much.  Why not? I don’t want to do this alone! And he’s such a sweet guy and he loves me so much.  Sure.  Yeah, I mean whatever.  No. No, I don’t. Could you be a dear and go tell him?  Hey.  Surprised?  I know.  You didn’t propose to me. Joey did.  Uh… You didn’t propose to me, Chandler didn’t propose to me, but Joey did.  Yes you did!  Well then why did you give me a ring?  Yes, you did!  Yes, you did!  Yes, you did! And don’t you say, \"No, I didn’t!\"  He was right there. He got down on one knee and proposed.  Yeah, what did happen?  Yeah, but you said, \"Will you marry me?\"  Yes, you did!  Well then Joey, what the hell were you doing with an engagement ring?!  You were gonna propose to me?  Okay.  Oh my God!  She’s doing it Look, she’s breast-feeding look!  Okay.  Oh wow, this feels weird.  Wonderful weird.  Honey don’t worry, it was my mistake.  She’s perfect.  We really are.  I know. I know. I’ve feeling…  Yeah, maybe.  Wh-what’s that?  I’m sorry, what?  No, but they stuck me in personal shopping. Which is just a huge step down!  Uh-huh.  Hi!  Hi, I’m Rachel Green. What can I do for you Joshua?  Oh, I’m so sorry.  Well, at least that’s a great suit.  Okay.  I have the best job in the entire world! The most adorable guy came over today, and I got to dress him up all day!  Oh, I wish he was a doll, then I could get a Rachel doll and bump them together and make kissy noises. Oh! And he has the most beautiful name, I never realised it, Joshua! Josh-u-a! Joshua! Josh.  Hi-e!!  Well, it was just something Josh said about v-necks, but you had to be there.  It’s Joshua.  Why? Honey, what is the big deal?  Yeah, that’s true.  Chandler, what did she say?  Beefsteak Charlie’s?  Hi!  So I was with Joshua for an hour today, and he has not asked me out. It’s just so frustrating!  Really? It doesn’t seem desperate?  Hmm-mmm.  Yeah but, I’ve never asked a guy out before.  No. Have you?  I don’t even know how I would go about it.  Ohh, God, I just got so nervous that he would say no.  Really?! You think that will work?  Oh! Well, as a single woman, who is available, I think you look great!  Great.  Sure.  Yeah-eah-ha!  Oh well, you don’t want to do that now?!  Okay.  Basketball!  I uh, I have two tickets to the Knicks game tonight if you’re interested, just as a thank you for this week.  Really?  I have an extra ticket. An extra ticket. Not, two tickets, I have an extra ticket.  He didn’t turn me down! He’s at the game isn’t he? I got the date, I’m just not on it!  Wow! Monica!  Honey, this is not your fault, just because you guys had a fight, it does not justify her sleeping with someone.  Really?  I’m having dinner with my dad tomorrow night, do you wanna come?  Oh no, no, I’ll be there too.  No Phoebe! I just need you there for support. I haven’t told him I’m pregnant yet.  ‘Cause I know he’s gonna flip out and I hate it when he’s angry.  What Phoebe? Wait! One time he caught me smoking he said if he ever saw me doing that again he’d make me eat the entire pack.  Thank you.  Well you could’ve untied it with your hands.  Well actually umm…  This was such a huge mistake. I can’t tell him Phoebe. I can’t, I can’t, I can’t, I can’t…  No it’s okay, this is what’s gonna happen. I’m gonna wait a couple years and then the baby will tell him.  Well… Umm, I got TiVo.  Phoebe!  Well uh, yes and no. Except not no. So to sum it up, yeah.  Yeah.  Who?  February 2nd!  I know. I know. I panicked, I panicked. I didn’t want him to start yelling at me like I was some ’74 Latour.  All right here he comes. I’m gonna do this, I’m gonna tell him, I’m gonna be strong.  Yeah?  There’s not gonna be a wedding. Ross and I are not getting married.  I’m sorry daddy.  Oh now daddy, stay calm. Please.  Yes. Yes, he says I’m damaged goods.  Ross I’m so sorry. Okay. I-I will promise I will straighten this out with him tomorrow in person, or via e-mail.  Oh okay, I’ll fix that to. What’s her e-mail address?  All right, I promise. I’ll fix this. I swear. I’ll-I’ll-I’ll-I’ll talk to her.  Okay.  I know Mona, just hear me out. First of all, I’m so sorry about my father yelling at you, but I heard you totally held your own. You’re gonna have to tell me how you did that.  Okay. Um…But—Okay, yes Ross and I used to date. And yes we are gonna have a baby. But we are definitely not getting back together.  Oh we just—we drove each other crazy!  I mean he was possessive, he was jealous, he could never just let the little things go!  About an hour ago.  Yeah, I mean, you should play in public!  Oh, I can’t believe I ever let him touch me with those fingers.  Why not?  Phoebe, the place has emptied because of him.  Yeah, Phoebe you’re… awful!  I know, I remember that!  Well, Chandler, you’re gonna have to tell him.  Because you do.  Phoebe, his music could not get any worse. There are rats in the basement that are hanging themselves.  What?  Hey! Out of all of us, who do you think is gonna get married next?  Oh no-no, no! It’s good! It’s all good! I-I actually work at Ralph Lauren!  I will not! I’m the divisional head of men’s sportswear!  Oh please…  No.  Oh tomorrow, oh I don’t know. Um…  Shut up.  Wow! What do you do now?  Shut up that was my friend Melissa from college.  She’s actually very sweet and we used to be very close.  It’s not a big deal!  No we weren’t! It was nothing! It was one night, senior year we went to a party, had a lot of sangria and y’know, ended up…kissing for a bit.  Hey!  Stop picturing it!!  That is not a problem.  I’m Monica’s maid of honor. Okay? Don’t try to blue pin me!  Oh they are nice. We-we custom-make tuxedos for celebrities and then when they’re done with them they just send ‘em back.  Some of them.  Honey, might I suggest watching a little more ESPN and a little less E!?  Umm, well let’s see uh, this one is Tom Brokaw.  Uh-huh.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It’s a pretty cool tux.  So Joey I just hooked Ross and Chandler up with some tuxedos for the wedding, do you need one?  Well, what are you going to wear?  Huh. Does Monica know about this?  Oh, y’know what? I can’t. I have to have dinner with that Melissa girl.  Well, do you want to hear what actually happened or Joey’s lewd version?  Hey, come on! I had this friend from college and I made the stupid mistake of telling Joey that one time…she and I y’know…kissed a little bit.  It-it did!  Yeah, it was senior year in college. It was after the Sigma Chi luau and Melissa and I got very drunk! And we ended up kissing! For several minutes!  Yeah, why is it so hard for you to believe?!  I’m not saying that I’m a lesbian! I’m just saying that this happened!  I’m not vanilla! I’ve done lots of crazy things! I mean I got-I got drunk and married in Vegas!  All right, y’know what? If you don’t want to believe me about this, why don’t you just come with me to dinner tonight and she will tell you.  Oh. Oh, that’s great!  Remember?! We—come on both had the sarongs on, and we had the-the coconut bikini tops…  …we went back the house and we got really silly and we…we made out.  How can you not remember us kissing?!  Wh… Come on! Remember? We were on the sleeping porch! We couldn’t stop giggling? And our coconuts kept knockin’ together?  Yeah—but come on—Listen, I’m sorry I don’t want to make you uncomfortable, but I told Phoebe that it happened and she doesn’t believe me.  No!!  Thank you Phoebe.  It happened! I am telling you it happened!  I’m sorry!  Wow! I mean I had no idea that that was gonna…  What the hell was that?!  And?  Oh does it matter?! All that matters is that you look so handsome.  I don’t want to say.  Diane Keeton.  HEY!! Do you have to do that? It’s Saturday!  I hate this apartment! I hate the color of these walls! I hate the fact that this place still smells like bird! I hate that singing guy!  Stop it! I will kill you. I hate the fact that my room is so small.  Monica, you don’t even have a bed, you sleep in a ball on the floor!  I’m sorry. I’m so sorry.  So—Hey, Pheebs! So, how are the elves?  Yeah, my mom got my dad’s season tickets in the divorce, so she just gave them to me.  Yeah.  Do you guys want these?  Ohh, well you got ‘em.  Just give us our apartment back!  Oh, come on! We know what these are worth.  You’re bachelor pad?!  Or I’ll give them to my new boyfriend, Joshua.  All right, okay, look, what if you could keep the apartment and get the tickets?  Let me finish.  I’m talking about a bet, winner takes all.  Oh, okay, well, I think we should let Phoebe decide, because she’s the only who’s impartial, and she’s so pretty.  What? Shut up! We’re winning!  Okay.  All right, cut, let’s pick again, pick again.  All right. We figured you might respond this way, so we have a backup offer.  Let us keep the apartment and…  Yeah! Can you believe that something that stupid actually got us our apartment back?  Yeah.  Come on! You guys can pee standing up.  It\\'s my father. He wants to give me a Mercedes convertible.  Yeah, well, it\\'s a Mercedes if I move back home. Oh, it was horrible. He called me young lady.  Oh, yeah, yeah. Actually, I got the extended disco version, with three choruses of \"You\\'ll never make it on your own\".  Oh, big glamour night. Me and Monica at Laundorama.  Who?  Don\\'t you have a laundry room in your building?  Sure.  Oh, \\'scuse me. I was kinda using that machine.  But I saved it. I put my basket on top.  What?  Hi, uh, nothing. That horrible woman just took my machine.  Yeah, but, there were no suds.  Well, you know, no suds, no save.  That was amazing. I can\\'t even send back soup.  What\\'s that?  Oh god. Oh, am I being like a total laundry spaz? I mean, am I supposed to use like one machine for shirts and another machine for pants?  Well, not myself, but I know other people that have. Ok, you caught me. I\\'m a laundry virgin.  Ok, I know this is gonna sound really stupid, but I feel that if I can do this, you know, if I can actually do my own laundry, there isn\\'t anything I can\\'t do.  What uh-oh?  Ross, what\\'s the matter?  Come on, show me.  Oh, everything\\'s pink.  Except it didn\\'t. It happened to me. Oh, god, I\\'m gonna look like a big marshmallow peep. What am I doing? What am I doing? My father\\'s right. I can\\'t live on my own! I can\\'t even do laundry!  Oh, I guess. Except everything looks like jammies now.  Whoa, I\\'m sorry. Excuse me. We had this cart.  I\\'m sorry, you know, maybe I wasn\\'t being clear. Uh, this is our cart.  Hey, hey, hey, hey, quit making up rules!  All right, listen, missy. If you want this cart, you\\'re gonna have to take me with it!  I could not have done this without you.  Are you sure?  Oh, are you sure you\\'re ok?  Does it still hurt?  Where\\'s Chandler?  I don\\'t wanna stand in the way of true love or anything, but I think a cantaloupe might hurt less.  Woow!I haven\\'t seen you this worked up since you did that dog food commercial and you thought you were gonna be with a real talking dog!  Hey, that was an honest mistake!  Yeah, that was an awesome day!  Hey Joey, is this the bed where Olivia lost her virginity?  Oh, please!Honey, just the fact that you want me here to support you, I\\'m...OH MY GOD!Is that Christian Sanders?He\\'s so gorgeous!  Oh, in my head he\\'s done some pretty \"not-gay-stuff\"!  Ok, not that you need it but good...GOD!Is that Chase Lassiter?He\\'s straight, right?  SSSHHHHTTT!!He\\'s asking her a question!!  Hi!  Joey, I gotta tell ya, I\\'ve been thinking all day about that scene you did, I mean, you were amazing!  God, you have to tell me what happens tomorrow!  Me? Oh, no, I am not an actress.  Oh screw her, that part is mine!  Kiss me.  No, I\\'m saying...  Can I ask you a question?  Have you ever had any weird romantic dreams?  Ok, well this is like that...in no way. I had a...I had a dream last night that I wanted to kiss Joey.  Oh yeah! I mean, that was pretty intense.  I don\\'t know! I mean, maybe that\\'s something to do with the fact that I saw him do a love scene yesterday.  Olivia.  So do you think that my dream means anything?  Ah! Well it was Joey reading Drake\\'s lines in the dream...  You took the same class twice.  Hey, so you guys, the funniest thing happened, at work...  Ok, we\\'re still on that.  Hey!  Joey, do you have peanut butter on the back of your head?  uh-huh  What...how is it going with Drake?  What...that scene I saw was so good!  Joey, is this that thing that you do when you say you\\'re bad so I\\'ll give you a compliment?  So?  Ooh! Honey, it can\\'t be that hard, I mean, you\\'ve been in love before?  Ok...this could be a little awkward...I\\'m just going to blow past it... well can\\'t you just use that method actor thing where you use your real life memories to help you in your performance?  Hi you guys.  Hey you.  So, uh, how was your day?  Really? Mine too.  It is our first official date. Our first date.  Hi.  God, oh God Monica, I forgot. This is our first date.  Oh, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you. See Phoebe, Phoebe.  C\\'mon, I\\'m not saying it was a bad movie, I\\'m just saying, you know, it was a little. . . hard to follow.  I know, I just didn\\'t want to wear my glasses on my first date.  Monica.  Honey, I\\'m just checking.  Monica.  Monica.  I\\'m sorry. Oh God, I\\'m sorry, it\\'s just that when you moved your hands down to my butt, it was like woah, Ross\\'s hands are on my butt. Sorry.  Well it\\'s not, honey I\\'m sorry, I guess I\\'m just nervous. I mean, it\\'s you, ya know, it\\'s us. I mean, we\\'re crossing that line, sort of a big thing.  I know, I know, I know, I know. I was just thinking about when they were there the last time, I\\'m sorry. I\\'m sorry, I\\'m sorry. OK, OK, look, woah, I promise, I\\'m good, I\\'m not gonna laugh anymore. OK put your hands back there.  Just one cheek.  Alright, just put your hands out and I\\'ll back up into them.  C\\'mon touch it.  Oh, come on squeeze it.  Rub it.  Oh, come on, would you just grab my ass.  Hi you guys.  Hi. Listen, I was um, thinkin\\' about. . .  OK, listen, I\\'m sorry about last night and I really want to make it up to you.  Well, I was thinking maybe a um, a romantic dinner with um, candles and wine and then uh, maybe going back to my place for um, dessert.  What\\'s this.  Hi you guys.  Alright you guys, I\\'m takin\\' off my shirt.  Ya know, Dr. Burke kissed me once.  I know.  It\\'s OK, it\\'s fine.  Oh.  Yeah well, you know what, so is uh, Sorentino\\'s.  No, you know what, it\\'s late, everything\\'s gonna be closed. Why don\\'t we just do it another night?  We won\\'t?  OK, that\\'s dead right?  What is this? What are we doing?  Grape.  Oh, God.  Ah, so what are we looking at?  Really?  This time it\\'s not so funny.  Ah, oh God. Oh, honey, oh that\\'s OK.  Oh, thank God.  Hi you. I can\\'t believe I\\'m waking up next to you.  What?  Do you think I\\'m someone else?  Well, believe it or not, it\\'s true. When Joey and I were together, he was wonderful. He was thoughtful and mature. And for the one week that we went out, he didn\\'t sleep with anybody else!  Hi!  Oh!  Ross, please, trust me. I buy 30 fashion magazines a month. Now, I don\\'t know who\\'s running for president or who that... NATO guy is, but I do know that you have to get as far away as you can from that hat.  Hi  what?  Oh! Oh, no!  Oh, yeah. Joey doesn’t share food. I mean, just last week we were having breakfast and he had a couple of grapes on his plate and ...  Oh no! Not me! Emma!  Ah, this place is great!  Yeah, down from seven hundred, you are saving like two hundred bucks!  No, no, no, no! Ross, wait! Come on! You know, there’s other stuff. Here’s a nice shirt, look at these nice pants...  Yes, they will! You know what you should do? Just go take a walk, all right? I know your size and I’m... I’m gonna pick up some really good stuff for you.  Yes! And I know what looks sexy on guys. Please, just wear what I suggest, and she’s gonna go nuts for you.  We got some really great stuff!  Oh! Really? Do you wanna try some of them on for me?  Hey!  Okay, let me just get a cup of coffee.  Closer than here?  Wait, I’m not just gonna drink somebody’s old coffee.  Oh, well okay. Well, there you go.  Hm-mm.  Ohh!  And heels.  Hi! Uhh, do you guys have plans for the weekend? Because I have my sister on hold, and she said that we could use her cabin for the weekend and go skiing. Huh? I’m asking you first, right?!. I mean I’m playing by the rules.  Chandler! You’re smoking? What are you doing?!  Okay.  No. Thank you.  What?!  What, no, no, no, mine are deceptively small I mean, I-I-I actually sometimes, st-stuff my bra.  No, I stuff outside the bra.  What, what’s it, what’s going on?  So you know how to fix it?  Great!  Yeah, we are definitely on Route 27.  I don’t know, I’m sorry, I always slept in the back when we drove up here.  Ugh, okay, well somebody will come and save us.  No! No, I am not getting in a car with Ross, we will just have to live here!  No you guys, I am not getting in a car with him, you’ll have to think of something else.  What is he doing here?!  All right!! Fine! Fine.  Ask me what?  You guys are unbelievable. No! He cannot come.  Why would you even want to come Ross? You’re a horrible skier.  All right, let’s go!  Oh, I’m sorry, were you speaking to me or sleeping with someone else?  Y\\'know Ross why don’t you put that on your answering machine!  Really Joey?  No, I think it’s very obvious who’s wrong here.  Yeah.  Thank you.  What? He said \\'we should do it again\\', that\\'s good, right?  Since when?  And everybody knows this?  Yeah, but if you spent it, it would be like shopping!  Chandler, what are you doing?  This Alan again? How\\'s it goin\\'?  Well, then can we meet him?  What bank is this?  What future boyfriends? Nono, I th- I think this could be, y\\'know, it.  I mean, it-it was like, it was like he made us into a team.  Well, no. That\\'s impossible. You can never be too Alan.  It\\'s worse than the thumb!  Well, I-I could live without it.  \"Indeed there isn\\'t\"... I should really get back to work.  Ohh-ho-hooohhh. The hair comes out, and the gloves come on.  Yeah.  I think he\\'s across the hall.  Uh, Joey..  We didn\\'t change..  Remember when we went to Central Park and rented boats?.. That was fun.  Oh, Phoebe, are you still on hold? I was supposed to call my Dad back like two hours ago.  What’s Flimby’s?  Okay. Hang up! That’s it! Come on!  No. No, not at all, not at all. I actually was gonna bring someone myself, so…  I meant, me plus one!  Okay, bye-bye!  Oh, hi!  Hey.  Yeah, looks that way. First ones here! Wooo!!  Oh! Tommy, this is Ross. Ross, Tommy.  Okay, uhh, I think I’m going to run to the ladies room.  Oh, hi!  Hey. Gosh, you look soo familiar.  We’re not actors.  Hey!  What time is it?  Tommy’s supposed to be here soon, we’re going to lunch.  You don’t?!  Umm, or, maybe, I should stay away from all men.  Yeah…  Tommyyyy! Say, what’s your favourite thing about summer?  Ross, would you just stop it! It’s getting really old.  Phoe-be!!  Joey? Are you in there?  Hey!  Is Joey here?  Well, at least you make each other laugh.  Well, I haven’t seen him since that night that he told me how he y’know… I don’t know, I think he’s avoiding me. Why is that bagel on the floor?  Ew, was Chandler naked? Sort of like a, like a ring toss kind of situation?  Okay, I’m done. Do mine.  Ah.  Well, I have been spending a lot of time in the lab.  Well just ask Mona to give it back!  Hi!  Hi.  So I thought Joey and I would be okay once we hung out, but it’s not even like we know how to be with each other anymore.  How do you know that? What if it just gets worse and worse and worse, to the point where we can’t even be in the same room with each other?!  Oh my God!! You guys have such problems!! I feel so terrible for you!  Oh yeah. That makes sense.  Ooh, I can do that.  Hi.  What?  Yeah it’s umm… Yeah it’s uh… It-it’s y’know—It’s nothing.  Yeah—No wait! Joey no wait it is. It’s something. It’s-it’s umm…it’s my boss.  Yeah, and umm my baby.  My boss wants to buy my baby!  I know I told you, it’s a really big problem.  Can you believe that?!  That’s what I told him!  Oh it was perfect! I mean it really felt like he was my friend again.  Oh that’s not important. The point is, I really—I think everything’s gonna be okay.  Hey! Oh Joey, honey listen, thank you for talking to my yesterday about that thing with my boss. That really meant a lot.  Whoa-whoa-whoa, let’s say more!  What?!  No! No, no-no-no Joey he doesn’t want to buy my baby! I made that up!  So that we would have something to talk about! So it wouldn’t be awkward!  Oh Joey, I can’t believe you brought my boss into this! I’m gonna get fired!  Morning. You wanted to see me?  Okay look Mr. Zelner…  Oh God.  Hi.  It’s all gonna be okay. They’re just so happy that I’m not suing them that they gave me one extra month paid maternity leave. So long as I understand that the money should not construed as a down payment on this or any other child I should bear.  Chandler, can you give us a minute?  Yeah.  Joey, I’m really sorry that I lied to you. I was just trying to make things…  It kinda worked. I mean y’know, I don’t know about you buy I haven’t thought about our thing since all this.  Yeah I know! I miss that.  My gynecologist tried to kill me.  So what happens next?  Great set tonight Phoebs.  Phoebe\\'s dead.  Hey, it\\'s not that big a deal, I was just curious.  Wow, I am so glad I\\'m not Monica right now.  Uhhhooo.  Well, there\\'s you.  Ok, uh, Billy Dreskin, Pete Carney, Barry, and uh, oh, Paolo.  Oh honey, are you jealous of Paolo? Oh, c\\'mon, I\\'m so much happier with you than I ever was with him.  Oh please. That Paolo thing was barely a relationship. All it really was was just, ya know, meaningless animal sex. Ok, ya know, that sounded soooo much better in my head.  Ross, Ross, please listen to me. Ross, you are so much better for me than Paolo ever was. I mean you care about me, you\\'re loving, you make me laugh.  God, Ross, look, what you and I have is special, all Paolo and I ever had was...  Ok, Ross, try to hear me. Ok, I, hey, I\\'m not gonna lie to you. Ok, it was good with Paolo.  But, what you and I have is so much better. Ok, we have tenderness, we have intimacy, we connect. Ya know, I swear, this is the best I have ever had.  Oh, hi.  Oh my God, honey that\\'s great.  Oh they\\'re in the top drawer. Hurry.  Ooooh yeah.  Ok, I, I will do your laundry for one month.  Ok, ok, ok, I will, I will, I, hey, I will clean the apartment for two months.  Agghhh.  Rock-paper-scissors?  Yeesss.  Honey.  So, he\\'s on the show, he knows what happens.  Oh good.  Joey.  Oh c\\'mon Joey, we care about you.  Well, maybe they can find a way to bring you back.  Yeah, Joey honey, I don\\'t know if this\\'ll mean anything to you but you\\'ll always be pre-approved with us.  I\\'d say from the looks of it; our naked buddy is moving.  Ohh, I\\'m gonna miss that big old squishy butt.  Well that is because your eye immediately goes to the big naked man.  What?!  Oh my God!  OH MY GOD!!!  Phoebe!! Phoebe!! It\\'s okay!! It\\'s okay!!  I KNOW!! I KNOW!! I KNOW!  Yes, I know! And Joey knows! But Ross doesn\\'t know so you have to stop screaming!!  Nothing! Oh God, we\\'re just so excited that you want to get this apartment!  Uh-huh, doing it. Doing it. Phone doing it.  Joey! Come here! Come here!  Phoebe just found out about Monica and Chandler.  Wh-what do you mean?  Ohhh, I-I would enjoy that!  Ehhh, no, I wanna do Phoebe\\'s thing.  You don\\'t have any secrets!  Okay.  Hey Mon, what are you doing now? Wanna come see a movie with us?  Oh.  Hey Ross! Any word on the apartment yet?  Oh.  What?! You-you actually thought that basket was gonna get you the apartment?  All right honey, we\\'d better go if we wanna catch that movie.  Oh Ross, honey you gotta stop torturing yourself!  Y\\'know what you should do?  You should find out what his hobbies are and then use that to bond with him. Yeah! Like if I would strike up a conversation about say umm, sandwiches. Or uh, or my underwear.  Yeah, he broke those too.  Are you kidding?!  Joey!  Ugh, I knew it! Oh I cannot believe those two!  All right. Be sexy.  Show time!  Joey look, just look at it this way, the sooner Phoebe breaks Chandler the sooner this is all over and out in the open.  Okay!  Come on, it’s a hypnosis tape. This woman at work used it for two weeks straight and she hasn’t smoked since.  Ross, I watched you get hypnotised in Atlantic City.  Oh right, ‘cause you always pull your pants down at the count of three and play Wipe-out on your butt cheeks.  Oh, y\\'know what, I didn’t want cinnamon on this.  Oh my God!! Great!  Well, that shouldn’t be a problem. I mean I work in fashion and all I meet are eligible straight men.  I think you should definitely go out with this guy.  Monica, last Saturday night, what happened on Walker: Texas Ranger?  All right.  Hey, how are those tapes working out for ya?  Yeah?  Thank you.  Hey Mon, let’s give Pete a chance Come on, he was funny, he seems really nice, and that check thing was adorable.  We use it!!  Oh my God, Monica’s gonna go out with a millionaire.  Oh my God, I can’t believe this is a real $20,000 check, oh this is just so exciting.  Oh yeah, sure, that too.  Oh my God! The millionaire’s here!  Hi!!  Just one drink?!  Oh my God! Oh my God! I can’t go! I’m gonna be too nervous!  No!! You are getting married! This is all I have.  What? No! It’s not a big deal! I do that too, with my shampoo bottle.  Yeah.  Grammy, Best New Artist.  Ohh that’s great!  So you’ll definitely get onstage, even if you don’t win.  Well of course I do! But y’know, favorite returning character is a tough category Joey. I mean you’re up against the guy who survived his own cremation.  Y’know?  Oh no, at the Grammies I always win.  Really?  Not right now.  Oh, see now I feel bad for the kid! I had a crush on a teacher once and it was so hard! Y’know you—I couldn’t concentrate and I blushed every time he looked at me. I mean come on, you remember what’s it’s like to be 19 and in love.  Yeah.  I didn’t. I got under him.  I know! My God! Do you have your speech?  Do you got your gracious loser face?  Now Joey remember, if you win you have to hug me! You hug me!  On TV?! Yeah!  Joey! Why did we have to rush out of there so fast?!  Oh my God you stole her award!  Joey I don’t think you know what behalf means.  Joey, you have got to take this back!  Do you really want an award you didn’t win?  Joey is says Best Supporting Actress!  Joey no, this is wrong! You have to take it back, okay? You don’t want to win an award this way. You’re very talented. And someday you’re gonna win one of these for real and that one is gonna mean something.  Thank you.  I cannot believe I’m gonna meet Jessica Ashley!  Absolutely.  I’ll be out in a second.  Okay honey, you can finish this later we’re gonna be late. We gotta go.  So what’s the final head count on my baby shower?  What?! You mean they’re not coming to a social event where there’s no men and there’s no booze?! That’s shocking! I don’t care, as long as my mom’s here.  What?! My mom’s not gonna be here?!  My God!  So my mother is not coming to my baby shower?!  Please, make sure she comes. It’s really important to me, I mean it’s my mom!  I don’t know.  Oh well actually gonna use a nanny and uh, I don’t even have a housekeeper.  Well, however great she was I just can’t afford that.  What?  Wh-wh-what? What?  Yes. Yes I do.  Why did you invite my mother?!  She wants to move in with me and Ross to help take care of the baby.  Eight weeks. I mean I love my mother, but my God, a long lunch with her is taxing.  What? You guys, come on! What am I going to do?  You’re right. You’re right. I mean I’m about to have a baby, I can tell my mother that I don’t want her to just be sleeping on my couch! Oh my God! She’s gonna want to sleep in my bed with me. This cannot happen!  Mom that’s okay that you didn’t get you a gift!  Oh yeah. Okay, see mom, the truth is I can do this on my own.  But mom, I really know what I’m doing. I can handle this.  He was a hamster! I am not going to vacuum up my baby!  Wow!  Did I say I was done guessing? Okay, thank you for that. Oh wow! What’s this?  Oh, it dispenses clean diapers!  Well that’s gross, why don’t you just take it outside and throw it in a dumpster?  What?! It goes ten times a day! What are we feeding this baby?! Indian food?!  So umm, you’re gonna stay with me as long as I need you?  Oh mom, I swear I’m not an idiot. I’ve read all kinds of books on pregnancy and giving birth, but I-I just didn’t think to read the part about what to do when the baby comes. And-and then guess what? The baby’s coming and I don’t know what to do. Oh, can I throw up in my diaper genie?  Wait-wait where are you going? Where are you going?  Okay.  Oh we did, but my mom got us the greatest gift of all.  No. She’s going to live with us for eight weeks.  I do. I really do. I don’t know anything.  Oh no? Pheebs? Monica? Do I know anything about babies?  Hello?! I still don’t know what the hell I’m doing!  I hope you’re going somewhere with this.  Really?  Yes, I’ve done my studying and I really know my stuff.  Uh, put your elbow in it.  Full, dry, on its back, and no loose covers.  Check if it’s wet, check if it’s hungry, burp it!  A card! A card! I pick a card!  How was the honeymoon?  Oh!  I did not know you spoke French.  Oh... you\\'re so sexy!  Seriously stop it, or I\\'m gonna jump on ya.  Ross...  Yeah, they said he\\'s gonna be fine, but he\\'s still heavily sedated.  Ok. If you really need to.  Oh, I really could.  Ross, please, this is a hospital, ok? That actually means something here.  Can somebody please go in?  Ross, please, don\\'t be so scared of him!  Oh, great, Are you gonna be ok?  Hi!  Oh good.  What?  What do you mean? You\\'ve been in my room before!  Ok I gotta tell ya, it\\'s really weird when you use my whole name.  Yeah.  Yeah, just so weird seeing him like that, you know? I mean he is a doctor, you don\\'t expect doctors to get sick!  What?  Really, I shouldn\\'t feel guilty?  Ok, maybe you\\'re right.  Wait, wait, wait, wait. Would you stay here with me for a little while?  Rachel Green is very happy you\\'re in her room!  I just don\\'t want to be alone tonight.  Wait, we won\\'t know that until we do it, will we?  Taking advantage? I\\'m giving you the advantage, enjoy!  Wow. Ok.  Mhm-mh!  FYI..  Oh stop that!  Oh, really, well Ross, you know what? I am a big girl. I don\\'t need someone telling me what is best for me.  What?  Oh, good.  Okay... Hey listen, just before you go I-I again, I just wanna say \"thank you\" for coming with me.  And also, you know I uh, I was thinking about what you said, you know, about the whole sex thing and... it\\'s probably not a great idea to go down that road again.  It\\'s a shame though, I mean, when we did it, it was pretty good.  Hey uhm, do you remember that one really great time...?  You know it was you\\'re uhm... birthday...  Well, I guess that\\'s all in the past, now.  No matter how much we want it.  That\\'s what we decided.  ...It\\'s kinda hard though!  You know, when two people have a connection, you know, that\\'s... just seems like such a... waste.  ...Ross?  Your agent called. You got that audition.  Yes.  Yeah, and Lennart Haze is starring in it…  Oh, yeah. Oh, I loved him in those cell phone commercials.  Oh, anything yet?  Joey, that was formula.  Okay, first of all, that\\'s stupid and second of all, I\\'m not allowed to talk to Ralph.  Oh God, that\\'s right. I blocked that out.  Oh, d\\'you like it?  What?  Pheebs, I... there isn\\'t gonna be any flying about! We actually thought we were a little too mature for stuff like that.  Seriously Pheebs, it\\'s not gonna be that kind of a party.  Nooo! Phoebe, of course there is more! I mean, I\\'ll just go and talk to Monica and get an ETA on the pee-pee\\'s!  Well, he\\'s coming from Jersey, he said he would get here as fast as he could!  Yeah?  All right, look, we did not know that you wanted a stripper so we went to the phonebook and we got the first name we could find!  No, that\\'s ok, let\\'s me just get my check book!  This is so awesome! College guys are so cute!  It... You can so totally tell.  Bitchin\\'  Oh.  I am sooo drunk.  No, wait. No there\\'s gotta be something else that you can do. I mean, what skills do you have?  So maybe something in an office.  Hi you guys!  Oh er... well you know Emma started crawling? I realised that this place, is very unsafe for a baby. So I went to the store and got some stuff to baby-proof the apartment.  Yeah, Why? You don\\'t think a woman can do this?  Monica...would you please tell Joey that he is a pig?  Wha!? What!? Come on! I found the hardware store all by myself!  There is a hardware store right down the street?  Hi!  Yeah, I don\\'t know who I was kidding. I can barely use chopsticks.  Don\\'t look at me I never get his jokes.  Just when you thought that dude couldn\\'t get any wierder.  I don\\'t know! I mean, what brought that on?  No you really think that\\'s what it is?  Argh. fascist  Man, don\\'t be surprised if her hands and her feet get bigger too!  Oh my god Chandler! If you can\\'t handle this, what are you going to be like in the hospital? With the blood and the screaming and the little present that\\'s shooting out of her!?  Joey! Why did you tell Chandler that Monica was getting a boob job?  I\\'m so sorry Pheebs.  Ross, you stay here and talk, I’m gonna go have a baby.  Give her some money.  They’re not!! Ross, they’re just saving them for the important people!! Okay?! What-what if I was the president?!  Yeah, it couldn’t hurt to look.  Oh, okay.  Yeah well it looks great!  Hi!  How are you?  Yeah it is.  That’s so sweet.  Oh.  Here comes another contraction.  Oh, that’s very—Really very-very okay.  Oh. Oh wait no.  No-no-don’t! Don’t leave me here with these people.  No Ross! Ross! Ross! My child has no father!  Hi!  Oh, thank you so much for coming. Ross, get in here!  New people.  They’re having their baby! It’s not fair Ross we got here first! Right after you left they wheeled her off into delivery. Oh but not before she gave me a juicy shot of little Jamie just crowning away.  Well they have uh, some unusual pet names for each other. Including umm, evil bitch and uh, sick bastard. Oh God oh! Contraction!  Ooh! Ow!!  Ross.  He’s looking at me.  Yeah it was.  Dr. Long, I’ve been at this for seventeen hours! Three women have come and gone with their babies, you gotta give me some good news! How many centimeters am I dilated? Eight? Nine?  Oh stupid metric system!  Oh for the love of God!  Oh come on!!  Go get back on that case honey!  Okay, well then bring her in.  Oh!  I get it!  Oh we-we didn’t.  Just tell me how.  Oh hi.  Oh not bad. Do you know that feeling when you’re trying to blow a Saint Bernard out your ass?  Oh that’s five Ross. Five women have had five babies! And I have had no babies! Why doesn’t she want to come out?  Doctor you gotta do something! I think you gotta give me drugs or you gotta light a fire up in there and just smoke it out.  What?  3-2-1 oh!!  I can’t. I can’t push anymore, I can’t.  Oh God twenty seconds my ass!!  Don’t say, \"Oh my God!\" Oh my God what?  Oh God. Is she gonna be okay?  I’m sorry, I can’t!  I can’t!  I can’t. Please, you do it for me.  Are you okay?  Oh God!  Okay. Well be careful with her, she’s really tiny.  No, not yet.  Oh no, Baby Girl Geller-Green.  Hello baby girl.  What?  Oh nothing I… Sorry, I just can’t stop crying.  I was reliving it.  Yeah, and y’know what? I love them both, so why don’t you just pick one and that’ll be it.  That’s not her name! I’m sorry, she just doesn’t feel like an Isabella.  Oh great! Suddenly she sounds like a biblical whore.  Well what are we going to do?  Well tell us! What are they?  And if it’s a girl?  Oh, just tell us! We’re not gonna want it!  What?  Oh honey, but you love that name.  Oh, I’m not doing it alone. I have Ross.  Well then he gets a divorce, it’s Ross!  Well I—That’s never gonna happen with Ross.  Really?  Well… That’s…y’know—That’s—We’ve been alone for the last twenty minutes we’re doing okay. Besides y’know what? I-I—Maybe we won’t be alone, ‘cause lately I-I—things have been happening between me and Ross, y’know? Right before I went into labor, we-we had this kiss. Y’know? So it might be the…the beginning of something.  Umm…that kiss before we left the apartment. That was some-something huh?  Nothing.  Really it’s nothing. I’m just…  I’ve just been thinking about how my baby and I are gonna be all alone.  Oh please, he’ll be with his real family, the twins and little miss new boobs.  I’m just saying that y’know, someday Ross is gonna meet somebody and…he’s gonna have his own life. Right?  I just never thought I would raise this baby all by myself. Pretty dumb huh?  Joey. Honey what would I do without you?  Oh, hon can you grab me my other box of tissues? They’re right on that chair under Ross’s coat.  Okay.  Joey.  Good, you guys are all here!  Well, I have a job interview at Ralph Lauren tomorrow!  I know!  Wh-what?!  Anyway, I\\'m going to be the coordinator of the woman\\'s collection, I\\'ll work right under the director, it\\'s the perfect, perfect job for me!  Yeah.  O-okay!  Hi.  Ugh, horrible! I did the stupidest, most embarrassing thing!  No!  Well, I didn\\'t know what else to do!  Thanks Chandler.  I can\\'t believe it! I got a second interview!  What-what, wait a minute, you don\\'t think that\\'s why he wants me back?  I accidentally kissed him in the interview, and now he wants me back y\\'know of course, \\'cause \"Let\\'s bring the girl back who kisses everybody!\"  Oh my God! What if he thinks I\\'m the kind of girl that-that would just sleep with him?  Maybe. I-I don\\'t know—Oh God, how could I be so stupid?!  Ohh, well I\\'m not totally back yet, but thank you.  Hi!  Thank you.  What?  Excuse me?  Okay-okay that-that\\'s amazing. How did you know that?  Ah, first, I-I would like to say thank you for agreeing to see me again.  Zelner! Right! I knew that! I really, really want this job and I think, I think I would be really good at it.  Really? Oh thank you! Oh… Oh, would it be completely inappropriate to give you a hug?  Yeah! Oh by the way, thank you for loaning us Pamela and Yasmine.  Ok honey, you really need a job.  Ok, so uh, who wants the last hamburger?  Hey, how\\'d the interview go?  So don\\'t do it.  What\\'s the matter with you?  Noo.  Oohhh.  What?  Monica, what are you talking about? You don\\'t know the first thing about the stock market.  We love you, we\\'re here for you.  Ohh, what is in that?  No no, \\'cause mayo, that would make it gross.  Run Phoebe run.  Are you kidding me?  What\\'s the matter?  Yeah Phoebe, I completely understand.  Time is money my friend?  How did you make $17.  What happened to uh, MEG.?  Hey Phoebs. Oh hey, how\\'s the dog?  Oh, thank God.  Ok, so Phoebe, now are you gonna call your dad and let him know that his dog is ok?  She\\'ll be a much better friend when the market closes.  Why the voice.  What?  For what?  Why, when did you get out of the game?  Oh no.  Ok. Look uhh, Mon I\\'m, I\\'m really sorry.  I, I don\\'t have it.  Nobody does honey.  Look at her.  I don\\'t know why Joey had to kiss her! I mean, of all the girls at the party, GOD!  All right, so... Ross, you\\'re ok with all this? I mean...  Oh, OH! Wow, I love those! Where did you get them?  Oh, it\\'s a gift certificate to this new SPA in SOHO.  Ah, why, now I can\\'t get a massage? There are so many things that she disapproves of! I can\\'t eat veal, I can\\'t wear fur, I can\\'t go hunting...  Well, I would like to have the option!!  Oh!  Phoebe, come on, I don\\'t wanna waste it! It would be like throwing away a hundred bucks!  I don\\'t care about any of that!!  Oh!  Oh, not as a friend, Phoebe!! Fine, I won\\'t use it!  I promise.  But I am going hunting!!  Oh, hi. I have a massage appointment under Rachel Green, and here is my gift certificate.  And... taped back together.  Ok  Alright-y then.  Oh... what an interesting name.  Damn! I wish I knew if that was right!  Wow, Ikea... what a rich culture. Uhm, you know what? I have a friend who is a masseuse.  I don\\'t know... maybe it\\'s because she has got such callousy fingers from playing crummy guitar...  For like a half an hour! Man, you can lie about Sweden!  How could you not tell me you worked here?  Yes you do, if you\\'re going to make me feel guilty for getting a free massage!  Oh! Phoebe, why did you lie to me about working here?  Phoebe, honey, if you hate it so much, you should walk out there right now and quit! Be true to what you believe in! Honey, you have principles and I so admire that! I don\\'t have any!  Good for you Pheebs!  Yeah?  ... the WENUS?  No. But don\\'t worry, I\\'m sure they\\'re still there.  Career counselor?  I don\\'t!  The meeting with the guy went great?  What are you going to make?  So what are you guys going to do?  My God! What happened to you?  But, but?  Oh! I see. And I\\'ve sort of been maintaining my amateur status so that I can waitress in the Olympics.  Who was that?  No.  Mon. I wish I could, but I\\'ve made plans to walk around.  Done.  Well hello! Welcome to Monica\\'s. May I take your coat?  What\\'s up?  What?  OK, OK. I\\'m with you, Cheech. OK.  Let me, let me get you some wine!  Excuse me? Can I help you with anything?  You don\\'t want to work for a guy like that.  Maybe, but shouldn\\'t we wait for Chandler?  Ok, Chandler, Mon, there\\'s only one bananna nut muffin left.  You went out with a guy in the Navy?  So wait, this guy goes down for like two years at a time?  Well I\\'ve had it.  Oh, this lipstick looks just great on you.  You see, you look beautiful. For god sakes, dim the lights.  Oh, stop that, stop that right now.  No sorry hon, Monica\\'s orders.  And there\\'s a peach cobbler warming in the oven so the plate\\'s gonna be hot but that shouldn\\'t be a problem for you.  So uh, Ryan, were you shipping off to?  Well do you get to look through one of those like, those periscope thingys.  It was nice to meet you.  So do you uh, think we can get you one of those uh, uniform things?  Oh yeah.  Ok.  Oh I\\'m sorry, we\\'re clo-... Hey sailor.  I\\'ll say.  Everybody? Shh, shhh. Uhhh... Central Perk is proud to present the music of Miss Phoebe Buffay.  Wow, this is so cool, you guys. The entire city is blacked out!  Wow, you guys, this is big.  That had to hurt!  Alright, somebody.  Um... Ross?  Oh come on, I already went.  I just never had a relationship with that kind of passion, you know, where you have to have somebody right there, in the middle of a theme park.  There, well, see? Barry wouldn\\'t even kiss me on a miniature golf course.  No, he said we were holding up the people behind us.  I mean, do you think there are people who go through life never having that kind of...  Yeah right.  You don\\'t.  Really?  You do?  What are you shushing?  Ahhhh!  Hmmm... this is so nice.  OK.  During a blackout? He\\'d get trampled!  Bob Buttons?  Here, kitty-kitty. Here kitty-kitty. Where did you go, little kitty-kitty-kitty? Here kitty-kitty-kitty-kitty...  And Joey....  And Ross.  Look at that!  Oh... Italy, I think.  Well, the cat... the cat turned out to be Paolo\\'s cat!  Oh, I found him. He was Paolo\\'s cat.  Ah, Paolo, this is Phoebe.  I have absolutely no idea.  God, the first time he smiled at me... those three seconds were more exciting than three weeks in Bermuda with Barry.  Y\\'know, I know it\\'s totally superficial and we have absolutely nothing in common, and we don\\'t even speak the same language but Goooooooddddddd....  Hey.  Well, y’know I was thinking of moving the couch over here.  So that there will be a decent place for me to sit.  And your lap does not count! Okay? Come on help me move this.  No?  I’m sorry, Rosita? As in…  Joey, it’s just a chair! What’s the big deal?  Stevie the TV?  Joey, Joey I am so sorry.  Okay, come on—Joey, I’ll buy you a new one! All right? We’ll go down to the store right now and we’ll-we’ll get you a new chair.  But don’t you think Rosita would’ve wanted you to move on? I mean y’know, she did always put…your comfort first.  You will like it!  You don’t even know!  Come on Joey, I just bought you a new chair! The most expensive one in the store! Hey, y’know what I was thinking? We could name her Francette.  Joey, the new chair will be here in an hour. Maybe we should actually move Rosita out of here. Y’know, start the heeling process?  That’s weird.  It’s not a miracle Joey! I’m sure there’s some explanation.  Joey, I really don’t…  Well no.  No, y’know what? Maybe somebody came in here and fixed it! Or something!  Hey, how’s…how’s the uh, miracle chair?  Yeah? Wow! Y’know, that this thing has speakers in the headrest!  Yeah! You can hook it up to your TV and you get radio!  Hey Chandler!  How would you like to sit in a chair that fully reclines, has a rolling massage, and speakers in the head rest?  Well what if I told you, you can do it in my apartment?  Well, it’s a long story, but umm I broke Joey’s chair…  Yeah.  Ohhhhh. That’s how it got fixed!  What? Wh-hey!  Yeah, he thought he broke your chair so he switched the chairs!  No Joe, no miracle.  No-no-no! This chair’s not going anywhere.  The logic is, that there are two of us and we are both strong enough to break a chair in half!  We’re the Cobras!  Ahhhh….  Uh-huh.  Hey!  Oh yeah, Joey broke it. Had to get rid of it.  Shhh don\\'t say that loud, Gunther\\'s gonna want to hug me.  Ok, you know what, I\\'m just gonna take her outside.  OK, thank you.  Oh, wow, Molly is just great!  What? You really think she\\'s hot?  And Joey?  Am I the only one who doesn\\'t think that she\\'s hot? Ross?  Hello.  Gavin, I just wanted to say thank you again for watching Emma yesterday during the presentation. I really owe you an appology.  Well, when we first met, you know, I thought you were pompous and arrogant and obnoxious ...  No, I just mean that, you know, first impressions don\\'t mean anything. And I-I think you\\'re a really good guy and I\\'m sorry that I misjudged you.  I was giving you an appology and you were totally checking her out!  Oh wow, you are really, you\\'re really a creep.  That is totally different for two reasons. One - I didn\\'t know that you knew that. And two, I wasn\\'t some creep staring at his ass, we had a deap meaningful relationship.  Oh, you know what - my first impression of you was absolutely right. You are arrogant, you are pompous ... Morgan! Morgan! Tag\\'s last name was Morgan! Huh!  Yeah well what are you, his boyfriend?  Because it took us months to find a good nanny and I wouldn\\'t want anything to, you know, drive her away.  Um, excuse me Gavin, I have a question I need to ask you.  If you like looking at butts so much why don\\'t you just go look at a mirror?  Oh, please, I don\\'t care about you enough to bug me. In fact, from now on, I\\'m going take the high road. And I\\'m going be very very nice to you, you \"momma\\'s boy\", starting right now.  Hi!  Yeah I am, I am! Oh, but first of all, Monica, I would like to introduce you to my very talented colleage and more importantly my wonderful friend Gavin Mitchelle.  Oh no no no no no, Gavin can\\'t, he already has plans, most likely with his mother.  Why did you invite him?? I can\\'t stand that guy!  I was faking it! Can\\'t you tell when I\\'m being fake?  Hey, Mr Philips, nice suit!  Shh!  God, I hope he doesn\\'t show up. Of course he\\'s not gonna show up, the guy hates me.  What?  Oh, Monica, you think Skippy liked you? Honey, all those buys had a bet to see if he can knock you over.  Yeah, sure!  Ahhhh , you brought rats to my birthday party?  Are you comparing my daughter to a rat?  whhh wait, you\\'re gonna leave my party to take care of a box of rats?  Hi. Thanks for the party, honey. Should I help you clean up?  Yeah, I just get a little bummed when my birthday\\'s over.  Mmm hmm.  No.  Oh, you bought me a present! Why?  See, Gavin, you\\'re capable of being a nice guy. Why did you give me such a hard time?  Well Monica seems to think it\\'s because you have feelings for me.  You do?  All right! Who\\'s are they? Who\\'s are they?  Well, get \\'em out of here! What\\'s wrong with you?  Hey, Pheebs!  What are you reading?  Honey that sounds like fun.  Okay.  Oh, I read that in high school.  So Pheebs, what is the book about?  Well yeah, but then I remembered I started it and there was this pep rally and I was, I was on top of the pyramid but anyway—umm, what is this book about?  Umm, well I would have to say that it\\'s a, it\\'s tragic love story.  Oh-oh-oh, symbolism! And uh, the-the uh, wildness of the mores, which I think is-is mirrored in the wildness of Heathcliff\\'s character.  Well, honey that was pretty obvious.  Be-because I didn\\'t want him to think I was stupid! I mean, that was really embarrassing what happened to you!  And with Chandler in the next room. What are you, what are you sick?  Hi!  Well, I was gonna, but I accidentally read something else.  Vogue! Hey, so tell me about this Jane Eyre woman.  Come on Phoebe! Don’t be such a goodie-goodie!  A cyborg?! Isn\\'t that like a robot?!  Uh, thank you Phoebe. Umm, well, what struck me most when reading Jane Eyre was uh, how the book was so ahead of its time.  Yeah, well, feminism yes, but also the robots.  That was not funny!  Phoebe, come on! What is the big deal? I thought this was going to be something we could do together! Y\\'know, I thought it would be fun!  Ohh. Oh, so you really wanted to learn. Yeah, y\\'know, Pheebs I just wanted to have fun. Ohh, you know who you should go with?  You get away from me!! You sick, sick, sick, sick-o!!  Joey has got a secret peephole!  Yes! He has a naked picture of Monica! He takes naked pictures of us! And then he eats chicken and looks at them!  Well, what is the truth?  Monica, is this true?  Okay, but if it only happened that one time, how come we found your underwear in our apartment the other day?  And the video camera?  What ‘cha doing Mon?  Hey! Those are all the things I’m responsible for!  The commercial?  Oh that’s great!  Oh, wait Joey! We fought the Nazis in World War II, not World War I.  Mexico?  Hi! Oh you guys look so beautiful!  Yeah! But I don’t know what he looks like!  Oh I get it! A…man…duh!  I’ll do it.  I said I’ll do it!  Monica! I’m not gonna screw it up!  Well of course that is what I’m here for!  Hi!  She’s steaming her dress, why? What’s up?  What?!  Yeah but, maybe it’s not what we think. Maybe it’s tell Monica I’m sorry I…drank the last of the milk.  Okay. Phoebe, I-I think Ross is right. What are we gonna do?  Okay.  Oh but he did say that they found the grandmother wandering down fifth avenue.  God! Don’t—We can’t let her start getting ready! This is too awful! Oh God, but wait she’ll be in the gown and then he won’t show up and then she’s gonna have to take off the gown…  I’m sorry. I’m sorry. It’s just…It’s just so sad!  Oh!  Okay.  Oh God I just can not imagine what is gonna happen if Chandler doesn’t show up!  Oh, I mean she’s gonna be at the wedding waiting for him and people will be whispering, \"Oh that poor girl.\" Y’know? Then she’ll have to come back here and live all alone.  What?  Oh my God!  Oh my God!  No, she had to have just taken that test because I took out the trash last night.  Okay Phoebe, we can not tell anyone about this.  Okay?  No. Why?  Anything?  Ross, she’s gonna start getting ready soon!  All right, well how much time do you need?  One hour.  Then why do you ask?!  All right, I’ll see you guys later.  I’ll figure something out.  Thanks.  Okay uh, but before you do that. I-I, I need you to talk to me.  Umm… I’m never gonna getting married!  No Monica! I’m serious! Oh, maybe I should just forget about it. Become a lesbian or something.  Well maybe it would make me feel better if I slept with Joey.  I know. At dusk. That’s such a hard time for me.  Okay. But wait!  Let’s go to lunch.  Right.  Oh!  You look so beautiful.  Hello?  Yeah, we got him back. Everything’s fine.  What? Why? Where are you?  Joey! The wedding is in less than an hour!  Oh my God! I’m gonna have to find another minister.  Ugh! Joey, I have to go.  Okay.  Yeah! Yeah. They’re…they’re-they’re my friends, uh, Monica Stephanopolus and uh, and Chandler Acidofolus.  Uh-huh.  Terry, I, I, I know that I haven\\'t worked here very long, but I was wondering, do you think it would be possible if I got a $100 advance in my salary?  It\\'s so that I can spend Thanksgiving with my family. See, every year we go skiing in Vail, and normally my father pays for my ticket, but I sort of started the whole independence thing, you know, which is actually why I took this job.  Excuse me, sir. Hi, you come in here all time. I was just wondering, do you think there\\'s a possibility that you could give me an advance on my tips?  Absolutely. Shoop, shoop, shoop. Only a hundred and two dollars to go.  Yeah, well it was. I, I broke a cup.  No, not even close. Forget Vail, forget seeing my family, forget shoop, shoop, shoop.  Thanks, you can just put it on the table.  Thanks, you can just put it on the table.  Oh my god, oh, you guys are great.  Thank you. Thank you so much!  Wait, wait, Chandler, this is what you\\'re havin\\' for Thanksgiving dinner? What, what, what is it with you and this holiday?  Oh my god.  Saw what?  I got the tickets! I got the tickets! Five hours from now, shoop, shoop, shoop.  Ok, I\\'m gonna get my stuff.  I can\\'t, I gotta go.  Ok.  I loved the moment when you first saw the giant dog shadow all over the park.  We\\'re waiting for you to open the door. You got the keys.  Yes, you do. When we left, you said, \"got the keys.\"  No, no, no, you said, \"got the keys\".  Oh, I gotta get my ticket!  No, I didn\\'t. I wouldn\\'t say I had the keys unless I had the keys, and I obviously didn\\'t have the keys.  Aside from the fact that you said you had them?  Well, you should have.  Because!  Because!  Oh, god, this is great! The plane is gone, so it looks like I\\'m stuck here with you guys.  What?  By all means.  And a crappy New Year.  Ross is on a date with my sister and they shut the drapes two and a-half-hours ago.  Yeah. And y’know who should’ve shut their drapes? Is that perverted old couple two doors over.  Oh don’t even ask!  Oh Ross, hi! Hey, how are ya? There you are!  Yeah fun? Great! So uh, so did you guys hit it off?  So uh, so did anything happen? Because rumor has it you guys shut the drapes!  Right. Was it the, \"Please don’t show me another picture of a trilobite vibe?\"  She asked-asked you out again?  Okay-okay-okay-okay-okay-okay-okay! I got it! I got it! I got it! I can’t! I can’t! I can’t! I cannot go with you and my sister thing. Okay? I just can’t. It’s just too weird, all right? I imagine the two of you together and I freak out. It freaks me out. I can’t do it! I can’t do it.  Thank you. I…yeah.  Ross thanks.  Oh no! No! No-no-no-no! No, I mean come on that’s-that’s crazy—I mean that’s crazy. So what’s-what’s going on with you? What is going on with you?  Yeah do it now, call right now.  Hey!  Ohhh well. Y’know what honey? The best thing to do to get over a guy is to start dating someone else. Oh! There is this great guy you will love at work named Bob! He’s a real up-and-comer in Human Resources.  It’s not random, it’s Bob.  No honey, okay, okay, you wanna know why Ross canceled the date? Because I asked him to.  Hm-mmm.  Because you are my sister and Ross and I have this huge history…  No.  Look, this is not that big of a deal! You just don’t date Ross! There’s a million other guys out there, you just…  I’m not telling you what to do! I am telling you what not to do!  Jill this is not about me being jealous of you! This is about you being a brat! Wanting what you can’t have!  All right, all right, well you just blew your chances at dating Bob!  In Human Resources!!!!!!  …I am jealous of her?! I mean who does she think she is?! Princess Caroline?!  Do I have my own castle?  No.  Oh my God!  Wow! I mean, I just—I can’t, I can’t believe this. Y’know, I mean you think you know someone even, even Phoebe who’s always been somewhat of a question mark.  Absolutely not.  Probably just the first half.  Oh, it’s a tattoo! That’s weird, Phoebe doesn’t… Wait that’s Ursula! That’s not Phoebe that is Ursula!  Hey! Have you guys seen Jill? I can’t find her anywhere.  Well, is Ross home? Maybe I’ll just call him to see if he’s actually seen her.  Ross! I think she is trying to make something happen with you to get back at me!  Ross, I am telling you that she is using you to get back at me!  Oh! I knew it! What happened?  What?! You kissed!  Well, it doesn’t sound like it! I mean, it’s pretty easy not to kiss someone, you just don’t kiss them! See look at us, right now, not kissing!  Oh, well thank you for taking your tongue out of my sister’s mouth long enough to tell me that.  What?!  Yeah, I got that.  Bye-bye-e!  I didn\\'t know there were docks.  Did you tell the doctor you did it jumping up and down on your bed?  Monica\\'s making jam.  Mon?  What?  What, what, what?  Oooh.  Okay, walk us through it, honey, walk us through it.  Nooo!  Well you know, after about thirty or forty fights, you kinda catch on.  All right are you guys gonna come down?  Good luck Chandler.  Bye hon.  Well, what happened to your jam plan?  Are you serious?  Down at the docks again?  Honey, I\\'m sorry, but he\\'s right. I love you, but you\\'re crazy.  When did you go to a sperm bank?  Phoebe, what are you doing?  Pheebs, this guy has been obsessed with your sister, for God knows how long, okay, you don\\'t just give up something like that.  Wow! Spinning that sounds like fun.  Yeah.  Hello.  Hi! Hey, Happy Valentine’s Day!  Oh, I’ve got big Valentine’s plans! I’ve got my Chinese food on the way, and the rest of your saltwater taffy!  Ross, we actually watched the documentary together.  I’m not here! That’s just my Chinese food!  Oh, I’m sorry! Do you need the phone?  Why? You saw it? Is it scary?  Well, now, wait. Now I’m all freaked out. Come on, you guys will watch it with me.  C’mon, seriously, you guys, you’re not going to make me watch this alone!  Uh! It’s horrible!  Oh, my God!  What? Did her ass explode?!  Oh, screw you guys, you don’t have to do it!  He offered me one.  Oh, God! Please, somebody say something.  I know, it\\'s huge, and it\\'s scary, and it\\'s... really far, far away from you guys, but this is such an incredible opportunity for me. And I\\'ve already talked to them about our situation with Emma, and they said they\\'ll do whatever we need to make us feel comfortable.  I mean, I\\'ll fly back and forth, they\\'ll fly you out... Anything we want.  Thank you! Thank you!  I got a really incredible job offer.  It\\'s in Paris.  Look, you guys... this is really, really important to me. And it means a lot if you could try to get on board.  Joey...  Hi.  Oh, well, she’s asleep now. Stop forcing that thing on her.  Oh, you’re not gonna believe what happened to me today! Ralph Lauren called, and gave me my job back!  Yee. I mean, it was so weirdest thing. They fired me and then out of nowhere they just hire me back! I mean, that place must have been falling apart without me.  No, I’m still going.  When the Louis Vuitton people found out that Ralph Lauren wanted me back, the offered me more money! Isn’t that great?  Hi!  You are never going to believe what happened to me today.  Ralph Lauren called again and they offered me more money.  Yeah. It was the weirdest thing. Zelner called me and he said we\\'ll do everything we can to get you back. And that I should thank some Ron... I don\\'t even know what department that guy\\'s in.  Well, I took it.  What?  You really think so?  But I already told Zelner that I would come back...  All right. ALL RIGHT! I\\'m gonna do it. I\\'m gonna go to Paris.  Yeah! I\\'m going to Paris. Thank you, Ross!  Oh! Oh, I\\'m so happy.  Oh, he is precious! Where did you get him?  Well, for your information, Paolo is gonna be in Rome this New Year, so I\\'ll be just as pathetic as the rest of you.  Phoebe, you\\'re on.  Pheebs, I can\\'t believe he hasn\\'t kissed you yet. I mean God, by my sixth date with Paolo, I mean he had already named both my breasts! ...Ooh. Did I just share too much?  Yeah!  Five.  Sorry. Paolo\\'s catching an earlier flight.  Oh, c\\'mon. We\\'ll have, we\\'ll have a big party, and no-one\\'ll know who\\'s with who.  Rome. Jerk missed his flight.  Vrrbddy, the bll is drrbing.  The bll is drrbing!  I can\\'t kiss anyone.  ...I think that bitch cracked my tooth.  So are things with you and Joey any better?  Oh wow, eight hours? So you could probably really use one of those plug-in telephone headsets huh?  You shouldn’t.  Well, I’m gonna take a nap, turkey makes me sleepy.  Honey, maybe we should take you to a doctor.  Ooh, so cute, that I’m thinking about jamming this pen in my eye.  I know, it’s sick.  Because it’s Richard’s son! It’s like inviting Greek tragedy over for dinner!  Is he okay in there?  So now, what exactly is the point of the box?  Huh, well maybe it uh, it changed.  Well isn’t it better that I exchanged it for something that I enjoy and that I can get a lot of use out of?  Credit.  Ooh, I like those sunglasses.  Fancy soap? I thought we were savin’ that for the Pope!  Ross, can you pass me the yams?  Would you stop?! What is the matter with you?!  Joey, had reasons.  What?!  Oh, he sees her!  Phoebe?  Look at that guy by the window, wow!  Yeah.  Really?! So this has happened to you?  Wow! This explains so much! Last weekend, I went from store to store sitting on Santa’s lap.  Ah.  Well, y’know what? I go see my doctor tomorrow, I’ll ask her about this. Maybe she can give me a pill or something.  Hi!  Yes, you are.  Oh, really, really good. But enough about me, come on! Where-where are you from? What do you do?  Right! Right! I-I actually meant in your spare time, do you cook? Do you ski? Or do you just hang out with your wife or girlfriend?  Oh, I love to ski! How amazing is this?!  No. I’m very comfortable.  No! Shoot, Dr. Schiff what kind of question is that?!  Well would you like me to lie down on the table?  Do you feel it too?  Hi.  Well, let’s see. Uh, they gave me cute doctor today and in the middle of the exam I put my pinky in his chin dimple.  Okay, even this is turning me on!  Oh hey! Hey Ross! Hey how’s it, how’s it going with you and Mona? Are you guys still together?  Uh Ross? You asked me that.  I think, if it was a little colder in here I could see your nipples through that sweater.  You gave her a key to your apartment?!  Hey!  What?  Phoebe no!  No! I do not care what my hormones are doing, I am not going to just do it with some random guy!  It’s just the pizza place.  I’m sorry honey, I’m just having a, having a rough day.  Oh you really, you really just don’t want to hear about it.  Okay, it’s just—and this is really embarrassing—but lately with this whole pregnancy thing I’m just finding myself…how do I put this umm, erotically charged.  Well, I gotta get up early and it’s almost seven o’clock.  Okay, good night!  You’re Joey!  Right back at ya!  And so bad. I don’t even know what you’re talking about because I didn’t ask you to do anything!  No!  That’s the end of this conversation!  Never happened! Good night!  Hi! Oh, Ross, don’t forget, we have that doctor’s appointment tomorrow!  Yep! Happy and healthy! And cute!  Popular.  Oh yeah! I’ve come up with a bunch of ideas!  Really?!  Okay! I was thinking if it’s a girl, how about Sandrine? It’s French.  Okay fine, what do you have?  Wow, oh my God, our child will be beaten to death in the schoolyard.  I’m really, really not.  All right.  Yeah! I don’t think you’re going to need it though. Okay, check this out. If it’s a girl, Rain.  Why?  Ross, why do you hate our child?  Okay, James.  But only if it’s a girl.  Oh! I’m sorry! Are we having an 89-year-old? How about Dayton?  Veto. Sawyer?  Veto.  Oh, oh my God! I can practically hear the mahjong tiles!  But you have it right there in that file? You could tell us whether it’s a boy or a girl? Dayton or Sandrine? Phoebe or Phoebo?  Right. Right.  Third one from the left?  What?!  I didn’t!  Okay fine, I did. But I didn’t see anything, I swear.  Okay, but Ross just listen to me…  But I couldn’t even if I wanted to, because I don’t know! I swear; I didn’t see anything, and I don’t want to know! It was just a momentary lapse.  Hey.  You know what? I’ve been thinking about it. I’m really coming around on the name Ruth. I think I would actually consider naming our child that.  I didn’t see anything! I actually changed my mind about the name.  I would—Sequoia?  Fine.  But Ross, you want the name Ruth!  What?  Ross, I swear, I don’t know.  A what?!  We’re having a girl?  That’s what you just said!  You said girl!  I’m not! We’re having a girl! Sometimes I can’t believe it’s with you—But still! We’re having a girl!  Oh, yes! We’ll have ourselves a little baby Ruth…  Yes, please.  No, I was waiting for you!  We’re having a girl.  Well, because if one more person says \"what a cute little boy\" I\\'m gonna whip them with a car antenna!  That went well. Almost everybody knew that she was a girl.  I\\'m the hell person whose office this is!  Excuse me?  Wait a minute! What do you mean, you\\'re taking over my job?  A vacation? My idea of a vacation does not involve something sucking on my nipples until they are raw.  Alright! Don\\'t get too comfortable there, because I\\'m back in two weeks! And I want everything back to the way it was. I can\\'t say that I care too much for the way you\\'ve rearranged my office.  Excuse me?  Can you please, please take care of it for me?  Let me just get this straight! So I go have a baby and they send some guy in to do my job?  That\\'s right. You\\'re very cheeky for a temp.  Oh yeah, what department was that? The Jerk department?  Did they mention that I\\'m rubber and you\\'re glue?  Oh, hi Mr. Zelner.  That\\'s great. So now, Super Gavin, when I come back where are you planning on flying off to?  Today.  No, I said today! See, for a superhero, not so much with the listening.  Listen. Sudden change of plans. My maternity leave just ended. They told me that if I didn\\'t come back today, they were gonna fire me.  Alright, alright. Calm down Norma Rae. They didn\\'t actually say that. I\\'m just afraid if I don\\'t come back right now this guy\\'s gonna try to squeeze me out.  I know. You know, we\\'re just gonna have to figure out a plan tonight. Can you please just take care of her for today?  Come on, I don\\'t know what else to do.  Ross?  You\\'re pretty.  Alright. Now that I\\'m back, why don\\'t you just fill me in on what you\\'ve been up to?  Hey, they were popular when I left!  Well, I should be involved in that, so why don\\'t you get me up to speed?  Oh, no no no no. I see what you\\'re doing here, alright, listen, this is my job buddy. Okay, I\\'ve had it for five years, and I know how it works, so why don\\'t you just catch me up!  Yes. Emma and I came in a little early to do research on the presentation. I actually made a few changes, but I think I\\'m caught up on everything. So ask me anything!  What? I can\\'t do that! I have the baby, and Ross is not gonna pick her up for another hour.  Well, there you go. You win, you win. You get to do the presentation, you\\'ll knock \\'em dead, no one will ever remember that I worked here, and then Ralph will buy his helicopter, and Super Gavin will just fly right along side of him!  No, I can\\'t, I have a baby.  Why would you do that?  That\\'s really nice.  Look-look-look-look-look, my first pay check! Look at the window, there\\'s my name! Hi, me!  Oh my God! (Rachel, Leslie, Kiki, and Joanne all scream and hug each other.  What are you guys doing here?  So c\\'mon, you guys, tell me all the dirt!  Okay.  What? Guys, I\\'m not.  I\\'m not! This is what I\\'m doing now. I\\'ve got this job-  Okay, I\\'m not just waitressing. I\\'m.. I, um... I write the specials on the specials board, and, uh... and I, uh... I take the uh dead flowers out of the vase... Oh, and, um, sometimes Artelle lets me put the little chocolate blobbies on the cookies.  What\\'s that?  Oh, God, ask them what they want.  But I haven\\'t used my card in weeks!  They wanna know if I\\'m okay. Okay.. they wanna know if I\\'m okay, okay, let\\'s see. Well, let\\'s see, the FICA guys took all my money, everyone I know is either getting married, or getting promoted, or getting pregnant, and I\\'m getting coffee! And it\\'s not even for me! So if that sounds like I\\'m okay, okay, then you can tell them I\\'m okay, okay?  Monica, what is so amazing? I gave up, like, everything. And for what?  ...Jack from downstairs?  Okay, but Pheebs, Pheebs, Jack gave up a cow, I gave up an orthodontist. Okay, I-I-I know, I know I didn\\'t love him-  But see, it was a plan. Y\\'know, it was clear. It was figured out, and now everything\\'s just kinda like...  Yeah.  Okay, but Monica, what if- what if it doesn\\'t come together?  Okay, see, see, you guys, what if we don\\'t get magic beans? I mean, what if all we\\'ve got are.. beans?  I\\'m so sorry, you guys. I didn\\'t mean to bring you down.  Uh, Pheebs? Who\\'s George Snuffalopagus?  Hello? Who are we spying on?  Oh, him, the little guy? Oh, I love him!  Yeah.  Oh please, they\\'re having sex.  So, whaddya think George is like?  How long?  He is so cute!  Oh, okay. Will you take my place?  No y’know, I don’t want to switch! Come on! I can throw wet paper towels here!  Okay. Now—What is my first line?  Yay!  I’m sorry…  Oh, Ross, relax. It\\'s probably like two dollars for the first contraction, and then fifty cents for each additional contraction.  What, it\\'s ok when Chandler does it?  Hi, I thought you might like some ice chips.  Oh, that\\'s funny!  Hey.  Yeah, well, it\\'s an important day. I wanna look nice. Um, has uh Dr. Franzblau been by?  Yeah, why?  No, honey, they\\'re not, but don\\'t worry, because we are going to find them, and until we do, we are all here for you, ok?  Ok?  Right, yeah, I\\'ve heard that about cute doctors.  Oh.  I\\'m a waitress.  Yeah, honey, they wouldn\\'t miss this.  Oh, god, I can\\'t believe one of us actually has one of these.  Oh, I know. Look at him.  You guys wanna get some coffee?  Oh Joey, I’m so happy things worked out for us that we’re having this baby together. I love you so much.  And I hope it’s not an inappropriate time to say this but, you’re the best sex I ever had.  Come feel this! Come feel my belly!  Joey! The baby is kicking for the first time! Will you please come feel this?!  Yes!  Aw, it’s unbelievable! Wow! She is kicking so much! Oh, she’s like umm…oh…who’s that kind of annoying girl soccer player?  Mia Hamm!  Last night! I just felt it and I went into Joey’s room and he was sleeping…  Really?  Okay. Oh God—Ow!—Oo!  Hmm, mild discomfort. So I take it you’ve had one of these Braxton thingies?  But wait you said everything was gonna be okay.  But I—But everything is okay. I’m fine!  Yes! Yes! I got half a mind to contract that doctor’s uterus though. Mild discomfort, what’s he talking about?  Yeah, everything’s fine!  Okay, no uterus, no opinion.  Oh you went to the movies by yourself?  Oh, I gotta go back in there.  No, everything’s fine. I just gotta go back…  Hey Ross! Check it out! I learned a new trick!  Yeah, I’ll be fine. But could someone please make sure that sandwich is gone when I get out there?  What’s up?  Yeah?  Are you asking me to move out? Do you not want me here?  But Ross, its you and me!  I don’t know. Is it crazy?  Okay, let’s do it. I’ll move in.  Yeah.  Wow! I can’t believe you lied to me.  Take the top down did ya?  Come on Ross give me the keys! Monica does not know what she’s talking about! I am an excellent driver!  Well in High School, that added up to head cheerleader.  I think she’s checking out your beehive Ross.  Gimme the keys!  Well no brush!  My God!  Oh.  Look Ross, if you’re so freaked out, just get in the car!  What are you doing?! Get in the front!  Oh my…  God. I forgot how much I love driving. I have got to get my license renewed.  I am not horsing around okay? I am Porsching around.  Really? You think so?  Okay. Switch places with me! Switch places with me! Come on! I’ll go under, you go over!  Oh yes, absolutely! Y’know, it’s weird uh, but I had a dream last night where I was stopped by a policeman. And then he uh…well I probably shouldn’t tell you the rest.  Oops sorry, my mistake.  Really?! You think so? Y’know, I had just rolled out of bed.  Y’know you’re-you’re probably wondering about the old date on there.  Yeah.  I bet you’re a Gemini.  Taurus?  Virgo?  Sagittarius?  I knew it! I knew it, ahh….  Yeah?  I won’t speed.  I promise.  Yeah!  Oh well…  Remind me to introduce you to someone!  Fourth gear!!  Well maybe he saw your hand slip briefly from the ten and two o’clock position.  It’s a different guy!  Oh my God!  Oh-oh! Okay, she’s kicking!  Whoa!!  Wow that was a big one.  Hi!  Oh yes I do. I do. I believe that there is one perfect person out there for everyone. And do you know how you find him? You stop looking for him. That’s why I stopped looking for Russell Crowe. He’ll find me.  Uh-huh.  Of course, of course.  Oh sure. Older?  Oh, I was just gonna ask!  Oh, it’s so sad they never had a chance to meet.  Joey? What’s up?  Okay what’s up?  Well honey, I’m late for a meeting. So can you just make it quick?  No. Not-not for me, but why don’t you take off your sweater?  Oh my God! Really?! Can I see it?  Huh. Wow, I wouldn’t think Hobbs would like that so much.  Um, seven…e-e-eight, eight years. Wow.  Yeah.  So you were saying?  Okay, well you had asked me how long we had known each other, and I said, \"Eight years.\" And the um, waiter came over and cut his tip in half, and umm…now here we are.  Wow! Wow. Wow. Wow, it is hot in here.  Joey, Joey I love you so much, but I…  Joey.  Oh Joey honey I don’t…I don’t want to lose…  I’m so sorry.  Yeah, that was a real good one.  Well, why shouldn’t I be? I have great friends! I have a wonderful job!  Come on, it’s not a big deal! We stayed up all night coming up with a plan so that us dating will not be a problem.  Oh Monica come on, y’know I don’t sleep with guys on the first date!  Anymore!!  Hi. Tag, I have a conference call today is that correct?  Okay, you hard worker! I’ll remember to put that in your evaluation.  No, I’ve just always wanted to do that. Can you help me clean this up?  I’m thinkin’ no.  Umm, I said I thought you were a good kisser, and uh, and that I like your tiney-tiny touchie.  Well, it gets worse. When asked if you take initiative I wrote, \"Yes, he was able to unhook my bra with minimal supervision,\" and under Problems with Performance I wrote, \"Dear God, I hope not,\" and then uh, then I drew a little smiley face, and then a small pornographic sketch.  Maybe it’s not as bad as I think. Y’know, maybe they didn’t take it the way I meant it.  Ugh, I just gotta get the thing back!  Yeah?  Oh my God! Joey!  Ugh!  Okay, I think we can get the evaluation back before they see it, but we’re gonna have to get into Mr. Zelner’s office. Now, he doesn’t get in until 10, so he’s no problem, but his assistant, Betty, she comes in early to eat her breakfast at her desk.  Let’s roll!  Well…  Oh no-no-no…  Whoa! I can’t believe you did that. That was really sweet.  No, you could’ve lost your job.  What?  I… It just—it took me so long to get that desk organized.  Oh yeah, she can\\'t be herself.  Yeah, totally! You are in such good hands. And I\\'m so good with meeting parents. With the father, you know, you want to flirt a little bit, but not in a gross way. Just kind of like: \"Oh mr. Pincer, I can see where Wallis gets his good looks...\"  Uh, he took the SAT\\'s for me.  Ssshyeah, well, duh! I mean...  Oh, with the mother, just... just constantly tell her how amazing her son is. Take it from me, moms love me. Ross\\'s mom one time actually said I\\'m like the daughter that she never had.  Hi.  I just finished getting Phoebe all dressed to meet Mike\\'s parents. She\\'s so nervous, it\\'s so sweet!  You WHAT? You sang... to our baby daughter... a song about a guy who likes to have sex with women with giant asses?  Oh you missed it. She was laughing. Oh it was amazing. It was amazing. It was the most beautiful, beautiful sound that...  Oh! You know, I just... couple of things I tried ... I just sang a little doo... Itsy Bitsy Spider...  Nothing else worked. That girl is all about the ass...  So fellas  fellas  has your girlfriend got the butt?  Shake that nasty butt...  Yeah, I can\\'t *wait* to go back to work.  Okay, Pheebs, you look in the kitchen, I will look in the back closet.  We are looking for our Christmas presents from Monica.  Don\\'t worry, we\\'re just gonna search here for an hour, and then we\\'re gonna go over to Joey\\'s and search, OK?  Chandler, aren\\'t you worried about what to get Monica for Christmas?  Chandler, that\\'s not enough. I mean what if she gets you a great present, two medium presents, and a bunch of little presents? And you\\'ve just gotten her one great present? I mean that\\'s just gonna make her feel bad. Why would you do that to her Chandler? Why? Why?  That\\'s right!  Oh, it\\'s a Macy\\'s bag!  Oh.  Wiper blades. I don\\'t even have a car.  Well, not this second!  Oh wow, it\\'s so beautiful...  What do you really want to do?  Wha... are you kidding? I can\\'t return this.  Yeah. Don’t do this to yourself.  I know.  Yeah! It’s an apothecary table. Does anyone even know what an apothecary is?  Phoebe hates Pottery Barn?!  Well this has story behind it! I mean they had to ship it all the way from the White Plains store.  Okay fine! I’ll-I’ll just tell her it’s an antique apothecary table, she doesn’t have to know where it came from. Oh! Look at this little drawers! Oh look-look it says that it holds 300 CDs.  Hey!  Guess!  Ha! See, I knew, I knew you’d get it on the first guess. Isn’t it cool! It’s an apothecary table.  Ohh, yes.  Almost.  It was only 500 bucks.  Oh, okay see I thought, I thought you meant how much was it when it was new, y’know like back then.  Yeah no, I mean it was at a flea market, so it was y’know, it was like a dollar.  And fifty. So it was like one and fifty dollars.  Yeah.  Uh, it’s from yore. Like the days of yore. Y’know?  Yes! That I know, this is from White Plains.  Hey! We’re here!  Oh no!  Ross! Phoebe’s gonna be here any second, she cannot see this!  I know you did! I bought the same one! And if she sees your table she’s gonna know that I lied to her. I told her ours was an original.  Because she hates Pottery Barn.  Ooo! Oh, I forgot they made sheets!  Ross, get over it! It’s not like she hates you.  Ross, she’s not weird, she just wants her stuff to be one of a kind.  Hey!  Ooh, Phoebe’s here! Okay, let’s turn out all the lights and we’ll just watch the movie!  He got it a flea market!  Ohh!!  Oh my God, Phoebe, Pottery Barn has ripped off the design of our antique!  Oh yes.  …see I can’t decide whether it would go better next to the new wicker dining chair, the Sahara desk, or the Parker console table.  I know, I know. I went a little crazy.  Hey.  Oh it does, it does! It is a room separating apparatus from Colonial times.  Well there’s yore. And uh, y’know, yesteryear.  Oh honey he doesn’t need my help.  Oh, she does want to.  Pheebs, I don’t know what to say. I guess the flea market was just better last time.  Yeah.  Ugh, those bastards! Let’s go.  Okay! Okay-okay look—no I did, I just wanted this stuff and I know how you feel about Pottery Barn. Just… Come on don’t be mad.  Well then honey, buy the lamp! Hey, we have that 60 bucks from Ross.  What?! No! I’m not gonna move out!  That’s right!  Come on, they were not that huge.  You don\\'t have birds.  All right, bye-bye.  \"Oh, my, god.\"  We won. We won!  How did this happen?  Ok, so let\\'s talk money.  Have you ever seen so much crap?  Monica, Monica, look at this lamp. Is this tacky or what? We have to have this.  What? Come on, it\\'s not like I\\'m asking for this girly clock or anything, which, by the way, I also think is very cool.  Well, what about my stuff?  You still think of it as your apartment, don\\'t you?  Yes you do. You think of it as your apartment, and I\\'m just somebody who rents a room.  Ok, while you \"mmm\" on it for awhile, I\\'m gonna go find a place for my new lamp.  What?  Monica, let it go.  Well, then, you\\'ll just have to eat the other lamps.  I am. Let me just get my coat.  Oh, please, Monica. You\\'ve always hated my lamp, and then, all of a sudden, it\\'s just magically broken?  Hey Chandler. Monica just broke my seashell lamp.  Ok, you win.  Chandler, you have just described virtually every man that we have ever gone out with.  She\\'s right. She\\'s right. You are no different than the rest of them.  Yeah. You\\'re not gonna end up alone.  You are ready to make a commitment!  What you got there? Something else that\\'s not yours that you can break?  Thank you.  It\\'s really not that big!  Monica, would you calm down? The credit card people said that you only have to pay for the stuff that you bought.  Oh no, not in my room! I\\'ll get him.  Let\\'s just say my Curious George doll is no longer curious.  Oh, Monica. You are not still going over that thing.  What?  You\\'re not an artist.  Oh, Monica, c\\'mon, you do cool things.  Hey.  What, what, so that you can dance with the woman that stole your credit card?  Go to the post office! I\\'m sure her picture\\'s up! ...Okay, Monica, y\\'know what, honey, you\\'re kinda losing it here! I mean, this is really becoming like a weird obsession thing.  Which one do you think she is?  What does she mean?  She could be you.  What? You just click when they click.  Nope. We took her to lunch.  No way. No way did you do this.  Oh, somebody will.  Where the hell\\'ve you been?  Are you drunk?!  Oh God, oh. Great, Monica, y\\'know what, you could\\'ve called, I have been up here, I\\'ve been worried...  Monica? Monica!  Yes, yes, it does. Okay, look, the restaurant called, they wanna know if you\\'re gonna be showing up for work?  Okay Monica, what are you doing? You\\'re gonna lose your job! This is not you!  Hello? Yes, she is, hold on a second, please. Monana, it\\'s for you, the credit card people.  What?  Good ones?  Well, can I keep the presents and still be 29?  Y’know, I’m still 29 in Guam.  Late thirties? Oh come on you guys! Is it just me? Am I overreacting to this?  Look, y’know I know my life’s going pretty well, but I look around and I just see so many people who’ve accomplished so many other goals by the time they’re thirty.  There you go!  Thirty. Ugh, I mean thirty! Monica, do you remember mean, old Mrs. Kreeger in the fifth grade? She was thirty!  Nothing. I don’t want to do anything.  Y’know what? I am going to do something today. I’m not just gonna sit around like some old lady. I’m gonna get something pierced. Like my uh, like my nose or my tongue or something.  What’s-what’s going on? Phil’s really pissed!  Okay, but taking care of a drunk, naked woman seems like a job for Joey.  Ahh!  Okay.  Well, I feel fine, but I think you’re bumming out the rest of the kids.  Okay! Y’know what? I realized it was stupid to get upset about not having a husband and kids. All I really needed was a plan. See I wanna have three kids…  As I was saying… I should probably have the first of the three kids by the time I’m 35 which gives me five years. I love this plan! I wanna marry this plan!  So, if I wanna have my kid when I’m 35, I don’t have to get pregnant until I’m 34. Which gives Prada four years to start making maternity clothes! Oh wait, but I do want to be married for a year before I get pregnant…  No, so I don’t have to get married until I’m 33! That’s three years, that’s three whole years—Oh, wait a minute though. I’ll need a year and a half to plan the wedding, and I’d like to know the guy for a year, year and a half before we get engaged… Which means I need to meet the guy by the time I’m thirty.  No! Ross, no! It is not fine! Eh-eh-according to my plan I should already be with the guy I wanna marry!  Ross, I really don’t think…  Hey Joey, can I…  Actually, I just wanna talk to Tag.  Whatever! Okay, I’m not your mother.  Not in the street!!  Hey.  Yeah, I’m doing okay. I’m um…let’s talk.  Umm…  Ohh Tag, umm…you’re such a great guy and we have sooo much fun together but I don’t-I don’t…  Well said. And a uh good example of the fun I was referring to uhh, but I just think I’m past the point where I think I can y’know, just have fun.  Yeah, it is! But you’re just a kid! I mean you’re 25!  Oh God! Y’know what I wish? I wish you were six years older. Well actually, if I’m wishin’ for stuff, I actually wish I was six years younger.  Oh, if I only want two kids, can I keep him for another year?  Everything you need to know is in that first kiss.  Yeah, well, word of advice: Bring back the comedian. Otherwise next time you\\'re gonna find yourself sitting at home, listening to that album alone.  Has anybody seen my engagement ring?  Oh, like I wasn\\'t dreading tomorrow enough, having to give it back to him... \\'Hi Barry! Remember me? I\\'m the girl in the veil who stomped on your heart in front of your entire family!\\' Oh God and now I\\'m gonna have to return the ring, without the ring, which makes it so much harder...  I know I had it this morning, and I know I had it when I was in the kitchen with...  Oh, I am sorry...  Oh, but look how straight those noodles are!  Well now, how-how do you fit into this whole thing?  So what are you gonna do?  You\\'re twins?  The lights, please..  I\\'m just cleaning up.  Oh.. a little..  A lot.  So, got any advice? Y\\'know, as someone who\\'s recently been- dumped?  Oh, you\\'ve got Carol tomorrow.. When did it get so complicated?  Remember when we were in high school together?  Barry?  I\\'m- uh- I\\'m okay... You look great!  I dumped him.  Oh, not much. I-I got a job.  Why are- why are you so tanned?  Oh no. You went on our honeymoon alone?  Mindy?! My maid of honour, Mindy?!  And you\\'ve got lenses! But you hate sticking your finger in your eye!  Okay..  Wow.  What?  What is that noise?  Well, I’ve been up since six. Thanks to somebody’s dumb-ass rooster.  Yeah! Especially not with all of these knives and cookbooks around…  What?  I’m so not impressed. Everybody snacks when they shop.  How many guesses do you get?  No! There’s no orange juice in there! We win!!  Okay, well, we won that one.  Yeah, and none of these stupid grocery questions, real personal questions.  Fine! We’ll ask Phoebe.  I know! I know, it’s such a huge, life-altering thing.  Tails!  We’ll take Literature!!  Chandler gets it! It’s Chandler Bing!  Monica, I don’t want to lose 200 dollars.  Monica?!  Okay, so let’s play for some pepper! Stop spending my money!  Oooohh that’s interesting.  Throw in the duck too!  Well, he gets the other one all riled up.  Monica, betting the apartment, I don’t know about this.  Why? Do you have the answers written on there?  All right, let’s do it.  All right!  14?  Space cowboy!  Oh gosh, it has something to do with numbers.  He carries a briefcase.  Oh-oh-oh, he’s a transponce—transpondster!  Oh my God.  Well I-I-I’m not moving.  No, it was a stupid bet! We were just playing a game!  Noooo.  What?!  I don’t care, I’m not going anywhere.  That’s right! You do what the hand says!  How did it go?  Y’know what, you are mean boys, who are just being mean!  That is not true. She did! She forced me!  Well it stupid, unfair question!  Will you stop calling it your apartment!  No it’s not!  Oh, I think I saw some in here.  I don’t know! But maybe if we keep that drawer shut, it’ll die.  Hi.  Oh, well, you know, they\\'re just separated so, you know, never know, we\\'ll see.  What, what incident?  What?  What are you, what are you doin\\'?  What?  Saving, saving, saving me from the pleasant conversation with the interesting man, saving me?  OK, Ross, listen to me, I am not yours to save.  What?  OK, you know what, are, are you being like, the blind date guy again?  Ross, there is no us, OK.  No, listen to me. I fell for you and I get clobbered. You then fall for me and I again, somehow, get clobbered. I\\'m tired of being clobbered, ya know, it\\'s, it\\'s just not worth it.  NO but Ross. We are never gonna happen, OK. Accept that.  No, no, ACC-cept that.  Hi.  Oh my God.  They had to reduce it because of, of my deviated septum.  Oh.  What?  Oh, that\\'s OK, it\\'s just the shoulder, it\\'s not my dress.  Oh, thanks. So, uh, what are you gonna do this summer?  Oh, the guys are here.  Oh my God, look there\\'s Roy Gublik.  Where\\'s Chip, why isn\\'t he here yet?  I can\\'t go to my own prom without a date, I can\\'t, it\\'s too late.  I can\\'t believe I don\\'t get to go to my own prom, this is so harsh.  Hmm.  Well, here’s another question for ya. Uhh, do you know what that silver knob on the toilet does?  Okay, good. Now that since you know, when you come over would you mind actually using it?  Guess who we ran into today?!  You are not. You have never been able to break up with her.  Y’know, you-you also could’ve used uh, lamps and then followed the light.  It’s coming from Joey!  Please, Ross, you-you got hurt playing badminton with my dad.  Oh, well maybe there was a dog lookin’ at him.  You…are…not going to believe it! Joshua came into work today, and guess what happened?  No. But I was showing him some cufflinks and I felt his pulse.  Okay, okay, okay should I be scared?  Wow! If only more people knew.  Hey!  Oh my God! Look at this!  I don’t care! The wires have come loose in your head!  And did you?!  Oh my God.  Hello, Mrs. Chatracus.  Thank God.  What?  Yeah.  Oh, sure! Do you need me to train somebody new?  Huh. Well, y\\'know that’s actually a really good idea, because that way they’ll be closer to the mugs. Y\\'know what, you should have the other waitresses do that too.  Well, yeah! I’m still pursuing that.  Well, I’m also sending out.... good thoughts.  The fear?  Well then how come you’re still at a job that you hate, I mean why don’t you quit and get ‘the fear’?  I don’t know, I mean I would give anything to work for a designer, y\\'know, or a buyer.... Oh, I just don’t want to be 30 and still work here.  Yeah.  Can’t I just look at the handles on them?  Okay, fine. Gunther, y\\'know what, I am a terrible waitress, do you know why I’m a terrible waitress? Because, I don’t care. I don’t care. I don’t care which pot is regular and which pot is decaf, I don’t care where the tray spot is, I just don’t care, this is not what I want to do. So I don’t think I should do it anymore. I’m gonna give you my weeks notice.  Gunther, I quit.  Hey-hey-hey that’s funny! Your funny Chandler! Your a funny guy! You wanna know what else is really funny?!  I don’t know, I don’t know, weren’t you the guy that told me to quit my job when I had absolutely nothing else to do. Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha!!  No, it’s not gonna be okay Ross, tomorrow is my last day, and I don’t have a lead. Okay, y\\'know what, I’m just gonna, I’m just gonna call Gunther and I’m gonna tell him, I’m not quitting.  You and your stupid fear. I hate your fear. I would like to take you and your fear....  No.  Oh my God! Yes, I would love that, oh, that is soo sweet, Joey.  Thanks.  Oh, I blew it. I wouldn’t of even hired me.  I know, I\\'m her!  ooh...  Hey, you know, before you said that nothing could happen between us? What changed?  Oh... okay, just hide!  Coming! Try under the bed, try under the bed!  Hi...  You would think!  Joey!  How... wha... Hey! What are you... What is this? Have you guys been listening this entire time?  Ah, what is this? Well, lets see, we kissed for ten minutes and now we\\'re talking to our friends about it, so I guess this is sixth grade!  All right, look you guys... Look, we appreciate all the advice, but this is between Joey and me and I think we can handle it...  Sure...  Get out!  Are they right?  Yeah... Yeah, we can wait, we don\\'t have to do anything tonight.  I mean, you know... Ross and I haven\\'t dated in like... six years...  Plus, you know, he is with Charlie now.  No...  Yeah...  Forgotten.  Nothing...  Nothing... It\\'s really... It\\'s nothing... Come here, come here...  Sorry, I just uhm... I can\\'t seem to get Ross out of my head...  Ross is coming over. I think now would be a really good time to talk to him.  Okay, well keep in mind that by the time you\\'re done, they\\'ll probably be serving dinner.  Still nervous?  Yeah!  So hi!  So you eh, you talked to Joey?  Oh! That\\'s great!  Oh, so everything\\'s okay?  Ah... Well, obviously I think so too.  Really? Excited?  Oh God! Alright, fine. You know what Joey, forget it. When we go back to New York, I will tell him.  That was one time, Ross, and they were only like 5 milligrams.  Aaah... Ross, actually there\\'s something that I really need to talk to you about.  Okay, uhm... alright, here\\'s the deal.  What? What is it?  Uh, look Ross, this really isn\\'t easy.  Because you took three hundred bottles of shampoo?  Well, yeah... Okay, look it\\'s about me and...  Wow! Well, clearly this is not a good time.  Hi!  Well, I tried, but then he had a shampoo related emergency. So I guess now it\\'s your turn again.  Yeah, \\'cause that\\'s what we do.  Okay, that sounds fair. It just means that once again we can\\'t...  No! Of course we can wait. Alright, so I guess that means good night then?  Goo--ood night!  Seriously, good night!  Okay.  Hey Joey, how\\'d the audition go?  Yeah, right.  I can not believe I have to walk down the aisle in front of 200 people looking like something you drink when your nauseous.  Because I promised Mindy I would.  Look you guys, I have to go, I\\'m the Maid-of-Honor. And besides you know what I just need to be in a room again with these people and feel good about myself.  Nooo!  Wow! What\\'s that like?  Afraid to ask him?  Hey!  Hi.  Yeah, when I was in the bathroom I saw the window that I crawled out of at my wedding, and God, I just started thinking that I shouldn\\'t be here, you know I shouldn\\'t, people are going to be looking at me and judging me and, and thinking about the last time.  God I know, you\\'re right.  Okay, I\\'ll see you after the thing.  Thank you, Okay, Okay.  Why the hell didn\\'t you tell me!  Oh my God this is sooo humiliating. I think the only thing that tops that was, was, was when I was in the eight grade and I had to sing the Copa Cabana in front of the entire school. I think I got about two lines into it before I ran and freaked out. Oh my God, my entire life is flashing before my eyes.  Oh Ross, would you stop, you got me, I\\'m dating you.  Oh hi, Mr. Wineburg, hi Mrs. Wineburg.  Okay, now that is the third time someone has said something like that to me today.  Oh, hi!  I know.  Oh honey, I\\'m so proud of you, Min.  Yeah, I love that story. Um, I got a question for you guys. Why do people keep is saying that is good to see me up and about?  Insane!  What?!  What.  Why are you adding, why are you adding, why are you adding, why are you adding?  Oh dear God.  Chandler, relax, Chandler, she\\'ll be here.  What’s the matter?  So what-what is the exhibit.  Hi!  I mean Ross all that does is remind us that you are interested in fossils.  Umm.  Yeah.  Ooh, the gift shop!  Oh, wait yes, but I can’t eat too much. Paul is taking me out to dinner tonight, he said he has a big surprise planned.  What?! No! Why?!  I didn’t know you could get married here.  Oh sorry didn’t mean to interrupt. It’s just such a beautiful space; do you do a lot of weddings here?  Monica, you should totally put your name down on the list  Yeah hon, it can’t hurt to put your name down! I mean in if two years if you’re not engaged you just don’t use it.  I’m gonna do it too!  Really? Who would, who would you marry?  Oh Pheebs.  It’s so secluded up here.  No-no! Big bear! Big bear outside! I think I-I—would you—actually, would you go check on that?  Well, okay. Would-would you get me a Diet Coke?  I came with Paul!  Get up!  Ahh. Thank you!  Op, ice. I need ice.  Thank you.  Go-go!  Ohh, thank you.  Well, she-she ob-obviously saw the tire tracks that were leading up to the closed garage.  Did-did you come up here to work on that term paper or something?  Whoa, that Diet Coke just went straight to my head! Woo!  Surprise me.  Oh my God Ross! What in heaven’s name are you doing here?  Return them?! Shh! They’re gonna hear you!  Okay. Well, I gotta go you guys. I’ll see you later.  Hi.  No, forget it! No way! I am not sending anymore Ralph Lauren clothes to prison. It is a waste.  I guess I can talk to one of my supervisors…  Really?! Oh my God! I’m successful!  Yes! I’d love to! Have her come by the office.  Yeah.  Hi Monica!  Hi boots.  Ahh…  Well-well you can give them to me! I haven’t felt my feet in years!  Oh Joey, I’m hardly a…  Right! Hi Dina!  Okay. All right Dina, well let’s talk about the different areas of fashion that you could get involved in. Let’s see, there’s design, but you may need a whole other degree for that. Uh, there’s-there’s sales, which is great because you get to travel…  Okay.  Honey, why don’t you sit down? Dina has something that she wants to tell you.  Joey…there’s something that you…should know. Dina?  What?! Dina…  I know.  What college was that Dina?  Joey, what are you doing?  Oh Joey this is crazy!  You’re supposed to realize that they are adults! And that they can make their own decisions.  Oh, come on kids! A little help here!  Joey, just because they’re not getting married doesn’t mean this is going to be a disaster. Maybe they have a plan!  Hey, now wait a minute! I get when you told people at first that you wanted to be an actor they laughed at you! Now come on Bobby, why don’t you tell us a little bit about your band?  Oh excuse me! Am I ruining my life?  So forcing her to marry Bobby is gonna make that happen?  No! Seriously! What’s wrong with you?!  Noo way, Kevin.  What\\'s the big deal? Why don\\'t you wanna see Janice?  Men are unbelievable.  Amazingly, that makes sense.  Sure Pheebs, you know, that\\'s what it\\'s there for, emergencies and pretend agents.  Very nice touch.  Unbelievable.  Okay, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute. Maybe it\\'s not so bad. How did you leave it?  Yeah, well that\\'s that lo-cal, non dairy, soy milk junk. We sort of, we save the real stuff for those really terminal cases.  Yeah, you do.  This is a very critical time right now. If you feel yourself reaching for that phone, then you go shoe shopping, you get your butt in a bubble bath. You want her back you have to start acting aloof.  Right. So, what you have to do is, you have to accidentally run into her on purpose. And then act aloof.  Oooh, honey, you\\'re not a total loser.  Oh.  G.I. Joe? Do you really think he\\'s gonna fall for that?  Yeah, it is.  Shhh...I don\\'t know what to do, this is totally unprecedented.  Yeah.  Yes, and grumpy.  He\\'s soo lucky, if Janice were a guy, she\\'d be sleeping with somebody else by now.  Who wrote it?  Okay, wait a minute, wait a minute, why are we so sure that this is a girl?  Well, he didn’t say, but it was a fire. I’m guessing not very good. Come on, we gotta go!  Oh my God! It sure didn’t look this way when I lived here.  Hey! Hey-hey, now this was no one’s fault Pheebs. Okay? It was an accident.  I have.  I did.  I did, Monica was so sweet she left a little mint on my pillow.  What?  Well, don’t look at me! My hair’s straight! Straight! Straight! Straight!  Oh.  Oh, Joey! Sorry!  Oh but look! That’s gonna leave a stain!  Really?  I’ve never lived like this before.  I love it at Joey’s!  Thanks!  Hi!  Uh-huh.  No, no-no-no. Phoebe, this was my fault and besides y’know what? I’m fine here.  No! No! Phoebe, come on! I don’t want to switch! Please come on! I can throw wet paper towels here!  I know. I’m sorry.  I cannot believe that you didn’t tell me that we are still married!!  So, I still have boxes here. I still have boxes at Ross’s, and I have nowhere to live! Wow. I could so easily freak out right now.  Well, maybe-maybe I could be your roommate Pheebs.  Well there’s an idea!!  That would be great! Wait, how long is Denise gone for?  December 26th, huh maybe she’s Santa Clause.  Op! You’re peeping!  Ross! Y’know what, I just got—why? Why did you do this?!  I don’t wanna hear \"Three failed marriages!\"  Well, y’know what? Thanks to you I’m half way there! Ugh! Oh! I am so mad! Ross, I don’t think I have ever been this angry!  Yes your honor, and here are, are forms, all filled out.  Uh yes, heroin and crack.  Well, you would know.  Ugh!  Well, yes, we got married in Vegas and uh, and the names I think.  All right look lady here is the deal, I came here for an annulment and I am not leaving here until I get one!  This is totally your fault!  Well, you ripped the paper out of the court reporter’s machine!!  Oh, little ‘X’s! Great! That makes up for everything!  Oh, name one stupid thing that is as stupid as this one!  Hey! Wait a minute! That was different! I did those things because I was in love with you!  Okay Ross, we’re—wait a minute. Umm, I uh, I kinda have a little confession.  Well, y’know this whole marriage thing, kinda my idea.  Well, remember how we were too drunk to remember anything the night we were married?  Yeah, don’t push it though.  No, it was on the house, it was, it was a newlywed special.  Hey, thanks Ross, for taking care of all of this.  I’m gonna need a copy of those.  Why, why not?  Chandler, you stole this cheesecake. That is wrong.  Umm, I think he’s still out. What’s wrong?  Hi!  So just bring it back downstairs, what’s the problem?  Are you serious?! Chandler, we ate an entire cheesecake two days ago and you want more?  Yeah and we’ll drop it off downstairs so that we’re not tempted.  What? Wait a minute, I didn’t pay, I thought you paid!  She could be out of town. Maybe she’ll be gone for months.  No that could kill her.  No so we’re protecting her.  But we should move quick.  Because I think I just heard her moving around in there.  Hey!  Oh, what are you going to do?! Are you gonna go run tell Monica?! Are you gonna tell Joey?! No! Because then you will have to tell them what we did! We are desert stealers! We are living outside the law!  What?! What?!  Wait a minute!  Oh no-no-no-no-no, no you don’t!  You think I trust you with it?! No! We’re gonna split it! You take half and I take half!  What? Oh, well then y’know what? I think Monica would be very interested to know that you called her cheesecake dry and mealy.  Oh for God sake just pick a piece!  Okay, you gotta give me some of your piece.  Oh! Yay! Look! There’s a piece that doesn’t have floor on it!  Hey, come on now!  Ow ow ow. Ow ow ow ow. Ow ow ow. Ow. Ow. Ow. Ow.  Ow ow ow. Ow ow ow. Ow ow ow.  You.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah, check it. Definitely, I want some of that.  Why, how much is this gonna cost?  Wel-wel-well what are we gonna do?  Thank you. Thank you. I love you.  Aren\\'t you a little cute to be a doctor?  ..so, he said it was just a sprain, and that was it.  Not stupid. The very cute, cute, cute doctors asked us out for tomorrow night, and I said \"yes.\"  Was that the cake?  I hope it\\'s okay.  Hi.  Oh, that\\'s great. Look at that.  Okay, listen, I\\'m thinking, why don\\'t we just tell them who we really are? I mean, it\\'ll be fine, I really think it\\'ll be fine.  Oh, Monica! Would you stop being such a wuss?  You know what?  You know what?  You know what?  Every day, you are becoming more and more like your mother.  Hello! Here we go!  Would you excuse me for a second?  It\\'s the woman from the hospital admissions office. She says there\\'s a problem with the form. Oh, god, oh god...  What?  Okay, let me just change.  Oh.  What?  Hi Joey, how ya doin’?  Huh, yeah I guess we are roommates now.  I’m not paying for half of that! I’m only staying here until my apartment gets fixed.  That refrigerators don’t live as long as people.  You’re jokin’ right?  Hey!  Do you guys know any cute guys?  Anyway, there’s this big charity ball this weekend and Ralph Lauren bought a table, so I kinda have to go…  I don’t know, something either trees or disease—Ralph mumbles a lot.  Yeah! It’s weird. But the thing is need to find a date.  Well, someone that has his own tux, or has the ability to rent a tux.  Oo! When’s her birthday?!  Well, y’know it’s just been so long since I’ve been to Chuckie Cheese.  Hey! You guys umm, I want you to meet Sebastian.  You found me a guy?  Well, y’know what though you guys? I really appreciate that but I think I’m just gonna take Sebastian to the charity.  Oh, thank you.  What are you guys doing?  Oh, but y’know, no, you didn’t give me your phone number.  I cannot believe you guys! He was really nice and he left because of you!  All right.  Yes, I’ll meet ‘em.  Hi!  Oh…  I don’t know. I know I don’t work late tomorrow night.  What?  Well-well a little blind sided but y’know good.  Yeah?  Oh, hi.  Yeah?  Oh-okay, but Pheebs?  I’m just sort of in the middle of something.  Okay, y’know what? Maybe I should go!  Yeah, I’m good.  I… Am I the only one that this is embarrassing for?  I’ll tell ya who should be embarrassed! It’s you guys! Come on! This is ridiculous! Thank you very much, but I do not need you to get me a date!  Oh that’s all right! Y’know, I ended up having a really good time. Y’know, the charity was a big success and they raised a lot of money and awareness.  I wanna say a disease.  Huh. All right.  Oh-oh Professor Geller.  Oh God Monica hi! Thank God! I just went to your building and you weren\\'t there and then this guy with a big hammer said you might be here and you are, you are!  Hi, sure!  C\\'mon Daddy, listen to me! It\\'s like, it\\'s like, all of my life, everyone has always told me, \\'You\\'re a shoe! You\\'re a shoe, you\\'re a shoe, you\\'re a shoe!\\'. And today I just stopped and I said, \\'What if I don\\'t wanna be a shoe? What if I wanna be a- a purse, y\\'know? Or a- or a hat! No, I\\'m not saying I want you to buy me a hat, I\\'m saying I am a ha- It\\'s a metaphor, Daddy!  Look Daddy, it\\'s my life. Well maybe I\\'ll just stay here with Monica.  Well, maybe that\\'s my decision. Well, maybe I don\\'t need your money. Wait!! Wait, I said maybe!!  I\\'m all better now.  Please, no, go, that\\'d be fine!  Well, I was kinda supposed to be headed for Aruba on my honeymoon, so nothing!  Well actually thanks, but I think I\\'m just gonna hang out here tonight.  It\\'s been kinda a long day.  Oh...see... but Joanne loved Chachi! That\\'s the difference!  Isn\\'t this amazing? I mean, I have never made coffee before in my entire life.  Y\\'know, I figure if I can make coffee, there isn\\'t anything I can\\'t do.  Hello, Paul.  So, like, you guys all have jobs?  Wow! Would I have seen you in anything?  I can see that. You look like you slept with a hanger in your mouth.  Oh, yeah.  Oh wow. Are you in trouble.  Want a wedding dress?   Hardly used.  Oh, look, wish me luck!  Guess what?  Are you kidding? I\\'m trained for nothing! I was laughed out of twelve interviews today.  You would be too if you found John and David boots on sale, fifty percent off!  They\\'re my new \\'I don\\'t need a job, I don\\'t need my parents, I\\'ve got great boots\\' boots!  Uh, credit card.  Um... my... father.  Oh God, come on you guys, is this really necessary?  I mean, I can stop charging anytime I want.  I know that. That\\'s why I was getting married.  Thank you.  No.  No, no, I\\'m not ready!  How can I be ready?  \"Hey, Rach!  You ready to jump out the airplane without your parachute?\"  Come on, I can\\'t do this!  I don\\'t think so.  Y\\'know what?  I think we can just leave it at that.  It\\'s kinda like a symbolic gesture...  Sorry-  No, you have it, really, I don\\'t want it-  Okay.  I knew.  I did.  Yeah, maybe...  Goodnight.  I\\'m just serving it.  Agh, it was the graduation from hell.  Ya know, I mean this is supposed to be a joyous occasion. My sister\\'s graduating from college, nobody thought she would. It\\'s a true testament to what a girl from long island would do for a Celica.  My parents happened. All they had to do was sit in the same stadium, smile proudly, and not talk about the divorce. But nooo, they got into a huge fight in the middle of the commencement address. Bishop Tutu actually had to stop and shush them. But you know what, you know what the good news is? I get to serve coffee for the next 8 hours.  Ohh, thank you for the wonderful dinner.  Ohh, thank you for my beautiul earrings, they\\'re perfect. I love you.  Now I love you even more.  Oh my gosh, wow. Monica. Oh my god. Mom. This is so great.  Wow you, you. I had no idea.  No, I knew.  What?  Why.  Daddy.  Both of them are here, both of them, both of them are here?  I can\\'t believe this is happening.  I do.  Well, I have to be, I don\\'t really have a choice, I mean, you know, I could look at the bright side, I get two birthday parties and two birthday cakes.  What?  Listen honey, can you keep dad occupied, I\\'m gonna go talk to mom for a while.  Uhh, let\\'s just stay clear of \\'I\\'m the guy that\\'s doing you daughter\\' and you should be ok.  Well those are very popular frames.  Yeah, like a chimney.  You want me to see a therapist?  Ok mom, you know what, fine, I\\'ll make an appointment ok, but you know what, right now, I gotta go, I gotta go do a thing.  Daddy, daddy, you know what, I really wanna hear more about this, I really do, but I just have, I just have to do a, some stuff.  This is it, isn\\'t it? I mean, this is what my life is gonna be like. My mom there, my dad there. Thanksgiving, Christmas. She gets the house, he\\'s in some condo my sister\\'s gonna decorate with wicker. Oh, Chandler how did you get through this?  Ya know, I just, so weird. I mean I was in there just listening to them bitch about each other and all I kept thinking about was the fourth of July.  It\\'s just this thing. Every year we would go out on my dad\\'s boat and watch the fireworks. Mom always hated it because the ocean air made her hair all big. My sister Jill would be throwing up over the side and my dad would be upset becasue nobody was helping and then when we did help he would scream at us for doing it wrong. But then when the fireworks started, everybody just shut up, you know, and it\\'d get really cold, and we would all just sort of smush under this one blanket. It never occured to anybody to bring another one. And now it\\'s just...  Oh ok.  Ok.  Pheebs? Could you get that? Please?  No! No! It\\'s just that all the people in the entire world that I want to talk to are right here.  Well, I guess I could take a couple days off work.  Oh no, wait a minute, wait, I\\'ve got a presentation tomorrow. I can\\'t miss that.  That sounds great.  Okay. Yeah, that would be nice actually, to have the apartment to myself for a night.  No! So I can be by myself. Y\\'know? Have a little alone time.  No! Phoebe just because I\\'m alone doesn’t mean I wanna walk around naked. I mean, you live alone, you don\\'t walk around naked.  Uh, yeah, if you want too.  Yeah, sure?  And um, what-what is that Ross?  Noo!! No! You thought, you actually thought I wanted to have sex with you?!  Ohh wow! I’m sorry, but Ross you kicked off your shoes!  Yes of course, absolutely! You\\'re right. I\\'m sorry.  Yes.  Okay. Oh wait! One more thing umm, do-do we still need to uh settle the question of \"us?\"  I\\'m sorry. I\\'m done. I\\'m done.  No, not really. I mean you\\'ve seen me naked hundreds of times.  Okay. All right, that\\'s true! But y\\'know I just don\\'t embarrass that easily.  No, I don\\'t! Ross, I think I\\'m just a more secure person than you are.  Yeah.  Yeah, all right. All right! Just keep walkin\\'! All right?  Ross! What are you… I\\'m sorry sir. I just, I think he just really likes you.  Yes, I\\'m sorry. Do you have any extra pants? Umm, my friend seems to have had a little accident.  Ahh.  Pancho Vila?  It won\\'t come off!  No, actually I took it off then I drew it back on.  Hi!!  What?! What else did he say?  Ross, no! There is no way I am leaving this room looking like this!  Ross, I am a human doodle!!  Oh my God, I\\'m starting to look like my great aunt, Muriel.  Hit me!  I bet 20.  Hey!  I\\'m doin\\' good, baby. How you doin\\'?  Ohhh!!  Oops! All right, so what do you want to do now?  Okay, y\\'know what? There\\'s only one way I\\'m leaving this hotel room.  Good luck to ya!  Wow!  Hi, hi can I help you?  Uh, no she doesn\\'t but I can, I can get a message to her.  What!  Oh as, as opposed to your other multi-functional nipples?  Ohh, I\\'m gonna have to get over it. God, see I didn\\'t know that\\'s I had to do, I just have to get over it.  Hey.  Hey, c\\'mon, cut it out.  What?  Sure.  What? C\\'mon, talk to me.  Why? Who\\'s not having. . . Are you and Julie not, are, are you and, are you and Julie not having sex?  Wow. Is it, is it \\'cause she\\'s so cold in bed. Or, or is it \\'cause she\\'s like, kinda bossy, makes it feel like school?  No, no no no, don\\'t need to know the details.  No, no, no, no I don\\'t think it\\'s weird, I think, I think umm, in fact, in fact you know what I think?  I think it\\'s sexy.  Let me tell you something. As a woman there is nothing sexier than a man who does not want to have sex.  Oh yeah. In fact you know what I\\'d do?  I\\'d wait.  Yes, absolutely. I would wait and wait. . . then I\\'d wait some more.  Oh yeah, I don\\'t care how much she tells you she wants it, I don\\'t care if begs, she pleads, she tells you she, she\\'s gonna have sex with, with another man. That just means it\\'s working.  Oh, God, no problem. So you\\'re gonna go with the uh, waiting thing?  What did, what did he say?  Great, people having sex, that\\'s just what I need to see.  Well, well um, you know, these movies are offensive and uh, degrading to women and females. And uh, and the lighting\\'s always unflattering. And, Monica help me out here.  No, no, I mean, no, c\\'mon you guys, I mean, c\\'mon look it\\'s only eleven thirty. Let\\'s just talk, we never just hang out and talk anymore.  Maybe that\\'s all we do, what about Julie?  Well, you have been in our lives for nearly two months now and we don\\'t really know you. I mean, who is Julie? I mean, what do you like, what don\\'t you like? We wanna hear everything.  So. I mean, who here does not have the time to get to know Julie?  OK Julie, so now let\\'s start with your childhood, what was that like?  Nah, uh, uh, uh, uh.  Now, what exactly is in a cobb salad?  What?  So, it\\'s pretty late, you\\'re probably uh, not still planning on. . .  Oh, well, are hey, are you nervous?  Uh, OK, I mean uh, what, how are you gonna handle it. I mean, are, are ya gonna, are ya gonna talk about it before hand, are you just gonna pounce?  Nothing, I mean, um, it is your first time with her and, you know if the first time doesn\\'t go well, well then that\\'s, that\\'s pretty darn hard to recover from.  Maybe you should put it off.  I know, yeah, sorry.  Maybe it, maybe it doesn\\'t have to be this tough. I mean, maybe you were on the right track with this whole, you know, spontaneous thing. I mean, women really like that.  Yeah, I mean, you know it, I mean, if it were me I, I, you know, I\\'d want you to, I don\\'t know, like catch me off guard, you know, with like a really good kiss, you know really, sort of um, soft at first, then maybe um brush the hair away from my face, and look far into my eyes in a way that let\\'s me know that something amazing is about to happen.  And then, I don\\'t know, I mean you\\'d pull me really close to you so that, so that I\\'d be pressed up, you know, right against you. And, um, it would get kind of sweaty and uh, and blurry, and then it\\'s just happening.  Ohh, God.  Oh my God! You look so beautiful!  I do the same thing.  Oh y’know what? Y’know what? Now that you know what you want you should go to Kleinman’s and get it half off. This place is so overpriced.  Okay.  Oh they’re pushing! They’re pushing!!  Well I…  No! You gotta get me out of here Phoebe! These bargain shoppers are crazy!  No! You gotta hold my hand!!  You’re out of Diet Coke.  You’re out of toilet paper!  Yeah, I went to a wedding once where they had swing music and uh, two months later the couple got divorced. And now I’m not saying that there’s any connection here y’know, but they did tell me that’s why they got divorced.  Well, what is the other reason?  Well you have to because maybe it’s stupid.  My God, get a room!  Oh God. What about you, Joe? What would you give up, sex or food?  No, you gotta pick one!  You gotta see these latest pictures of Emma.  Yeah.  Oh, no, no. That is a doll.  Oh. Who is the blonde, she\\'s pretty.  He\\'s not having an affair!  No, you\\'re not! Last week you thought Ross was trying to kill you!  Oh, that doesn\\'t mean anything.  They\\'re in a caaar...  Geez!  Oh, yeah, ok. Let me just grab my night vision goggles and my stun gun.  I’m telling you guys, we followed them out to a house in Westchester, the went in for like forty-five minutes and then they came out looking pretty happy!  Oh, look at her, so happy!  Phoebe and I saw Chandler with a blonde woman today outside on the street and then we followed them to a house in Westchester.  Who\\'s Nancy?  Are you serious?  What is wrong with raising a kid in the city? I\\'m doing it, Ross is doing it, Sarah Jessica Parker is doing it!  Yeah it is.  Well, it is, all right? When we were out there today, all I kept thinking was: I can\\'t believe Chandler is screwing this woman, but MAN this would be a nice place to live!  Well maybe I\\'ll just stay here with Monica.  You\\'re fly is open, Geller!  Ow, that had to hurt!  No Mon, you want to put them in concentric circles. I want to do this.  Oooohh that’s interesting.  14?  Space cowboy!  Ow...Oh Gosh!  Oh-oh-oh, he’s a transponce—transpondster!  Y’know what, you are mean boys, who are just being mean!  That is not true. She did! She forced me!  Well it stupid, unfair question!  Funny, because I was just gonna go across the hall and write that on Chandler.  Well, Phoebe that’s fine because I’m not moving.  Yeah, I do. I-I do, do that.  Well y’know, I don’t want you to be cold.  And a crappy New Year.  You can\\'t move. You just... you just can\\'t.  Yeah, we\\'re gonna let you be alone.  Aah! Why? What are these for?  Oh! So you\\'re driving up to Connecticut?  Yeah me too. oh! I have an idea. Why don\\'t we all pitch in 50 bucks, we\\'ll pool our money together and then if we win, we\\'ll split it!  Yeah so get ready to hear alot of ehm...boohaki, goshdarnit and brotherpucker.  Well when I talk to her I almost feel like she understands what I\\'m saying.  Joey relax! My mother picked her up two hours ago. You were there!  She dropped off a casserole?  Well, there\\'s two spots left right?  Oh no, I\\'m good, I don\\'t wanna get that turkey smell all over my hands.  You know, Ross, just keep making your jokes. How are you gonna feel if we actually do win?  Oh, I know, I know, the odds are against us, but somebody has to win, and it could be us! And then how you gonna feel? You know, we\\'re gonna be all like \"oh everybody, let\\'s take our helicopters up to the cape\" and you\\'re gonna be all like \"oh, I can\\'t guys, I\\'ll meet you guys up there, I gotta gas up the Hyundai\"  I don\\'t really care about the Knicks.  I\\'m hoping that if she hears it enough it will be her first word.  Ooh, you guys, it starts in like 20 minutes.  Ooh, I have another idea!  Well, well, well, look what mommy found!!  Ok, well Monica, suppose one of your \"special\" tickets win? How are you gonna feel when you win the lottery and you lose all your friends?  Chandler, would you just tell her what she did was wrong?  All right, believe me.If you win the lottery, it\\'s the last you\\'re gonna hear from us!  Oh, if she jumps, I get her tickets.  Oh, it is so unfair. It\\'s like that time they promoted Sandra over me at work.  No, she was just much better at job than me!  Hi mum, put her back on!  Why-why aren\\'t you more excited?  Oh, but of course it is!  I don\\'t know all the words.  Ok... \"Emma just said gleba\"!  You know what? There is a little part of me that really thought we were gonna win.  What?  So Pheebs, what are you going to do with your $3?  Me too.  How’d it go with Pete?!  So, come on, what was the big news Pete wanted to tell you Mon?! Or should I say Mrs. Monica Becker?  Why?! What is it?  Yes!!  Y\\'know I don’t, I don’t understand guys, I mean I-I would never congratulate Monica on a great stew by y\\'know, grabbin’ her boob.  Yeah.  Oh, ah with who?  Oh-oh-oh, which one is Bonnie again?  Oh no, I’m sorry, you look a lot different from the last time I-I saw you.  Oh, that must be it.  How could you not tell me that she has hair?  Yeah, I said what was okay when I thought she was some weird bald chick. I mean, y\\'know, that girl has hair got all over head!  Why, does she have a bad personality?  Come on Phoebe, look at that! They are not breaking up, look at them. Okay that’s, you know what that is? That is a, that is a second date, that’s what that is! Look at that, she just put her hand on his thigh...  You said she was bald!!  Phoebe, we can’t, we just can’t just let it happen! Okay, we have to do something! We have to break them up! Okay? Just go in there and like, shave her head! You owe me one bald girl!!  Yes.  What?  Oh!  Wait a minute, you’re only giving free stuff away to the pretty girls?  Oh my God, Jill!  And you know Monica and Ross!  Wow! What did he say?  Oh! Did you hear that?! My dad’s proud of me! My dad’s proud of me.  Oh yeah, sorry. Wait honey, so what did you do that made dad cut you off?  Jill, honey, I think this is the best thing that could’ve ever happened to you. I mean you needed to get out on your own anyway! And you know when I did it, I-I-I at first I was scared, and look at me now! I’m the only daughter dad is proud of! Okay, well this is, this is what you’re gonna do. You’re gonna get a job, you’re gonna get an apartment, and then I’ll help you and you can stay with us. Right Pheebs, she can stay with us?  You went shopping?! What, and then you just came in here and paraded it right under Jill’s nose when you know she’s trying to quit. Wow, you guys are terrible!  What’d you get?  Oh.  Apartment pants?  No, of course, of course I’ve heard of them! Ross, what did you get?  A pajmena?  Really?  Jill?  Oh, come on! You think that’s gonna work on me?! I invented that!  Hey!  What’s up?!  Well, it’d better not be about the apartment pants, because I just pitched the idea to my boss at Ralph Lauren and she loved it.  What?!  With Ross and Jill?  With Ross and my sister?  With my sister Jill and my ex-boyfriend Ross?  Oh there is no way.  Oh my God! I can not believe that! I mean I don’t really like it when Ross goes out with anyone, but my sister isn’t that like incest or something?! Oh my God, and they’re gonna have sex! Oh! Oh no what if he marries her too?! Oh this is just terrible, this is just terrible. And I can’t stop it! I can’t—I don’t own Ross! Y’know? And Jill, she should be able to do whatever it is that she wants to do! And oh my God, I can’t believe Ross is marrying my little sister, this terrible. Oh my God, this is just the worst thing that could have ever happened to me.  That is great. Hey, y’know who doesn’t have to job hunt? Ross. He works at the university.  Oh so you know that, you guys talked about that, so you get along, so you think you’re gonna go out?  I just, Phoebe, said y’know thought she saw something between you guys.  Yeah.  Oh not-not so much. Umm, what-what do you, what do you mean is there something wrong with Ross?  Are-are you saying he’s a geek?  No! No I, no Ross is not a geek!  What handsome is not your type? Smart? Kind? Good kisser? What those things aren’t on your list? Ross is a great guy! You would be lucky to be with him!  Oh no-no-no, no-no-no, that’s not what I meant.  Yeah but, he’s not your type.  Yeah but, you don’t, you don’t, you don’t want to try to much too fast. Y’know? I mean, you do remember what happened to the little girl that tried to much too fast don’t you?  She-she died Jill.  Hi!  Well yeah…  Really?!  Oh so-so not really never.  Hi! Wh-what are you doing here?  Well, I-I don’t like it.  It’s kinda slutty.  Yeah well, I’m-I’m a slut.  Rachel.  Yeah I know, and I bet you thought it would be weird. But it’s not!  Why aren’t you home yet?!  Oh yes, it’s me! Sorry!  Uh, I’m just, I’m just looking out your window. At-at the view. What are you guys doing?  Ugh, she is a slut!  Oh my God, look-look he’s taking off her clothes!  Oh, this is just terrible.  What?  That\\'s not the end.  Hey Phoebs, whatcha got there?  Hey.  Wow, he must like you the best.  No luck huh?  Uh, I\\'m holding Ben.  Ok.  This is how I would hold a football.  Ok, I\\'m sorry, I\\'m just not very good with babies. I mean I haven\\'t been around them, I mean, you know, since I was one.  Really?  What?  You think about stuff like that?  Two, two babies?  Then what\\'s gonna happen?  Uh-huh.  Wow. Wow, that\\'s great. Great. Ok, wow, you know what.  Yeah well, Ross just made plans for the whole century.  I don\\'t know, you tell me. One minute I\\'m holding Ben like a football, the next thing I know, I\\'ve got two kids, I\\'m living in Scarsdale complaining about the taxes.  Ross, you have planned out the next 20 years of our lives, we\\'ve been dating for six weeks.  Yes, but I, I think about who\\'s apartment we\\'re gonna sleep at tomorrow night and, and where we\\'re gonna have dinner next Saturday night. I do not think about what our childrens\\' names are gonna be. You know what our childrens names are gonna be.  What was the book?  Ok, Ross, Ross, ok listen, what we have is amazing.  But I do not want to have everything decided for me. I spent my whole life like that. It\\'s what I had with Barry, that was one of the reasons I left. I, I like not knowing right now and I\\'m sorry if that scares you but if you want to be with me you are gonna have to deal with that.  Thank you.  I didn\\'t know that.  Fine, I will.  Oh yeah.  Well I love you too.  Yes it is.  Well you better.  Ok Ross, just so you know, calling it a poopie diaper doesn\\'t make this process any cuter.  I\\'m sorry, what did you just say? Did you just say hi? Oh my God, Ross, Ross, Ben just said \\'Hi\\'.  Ben just said hi.  Ye-, no, my Uncle Hi.  Oh, I\\'m sorry, I guess I just bring it out in him.  Guess what. Ben just said his first word.  You know, actually it\\'s more like, hi.  Hi.  Hi.  Hi.  Take care.  Did, did he just, did he, did he just say, he said bye. He said bye. You said, you said bye to me. You said bye to me.  Yeah Pheebs, honey, she just got engaged a couple of hours ago. I doubt she’s even had time to…  Okay.  Hey!  I don’t know, y’know? I feel a little umm… No, y’know what? Nevermind, I’m gonna be fine.  Hi!  Well thank you, you too.  Hey, do you believe this? Do you believe they are actually getting married?  Ohh…  Yeah, I guess. I-I… I mean, do-do you think we’re ever gonna have that?  Oh no-no-no-no-no, no, no! We, you with someone and me with someone.  Shake it off.  No, absolutely. Y’know like it was umm…  Well you uh, you were always really good at the uh, at the uh the stuff.  Uh-hmm, uh-hmm, yeah, yeah, I really liked your hands.  Yeah.  Uh-huh.  Y’know, bonus night. Y’know, when two people break up but they get back together for just one night.  Yeah-yeah, we never had that,  What?  Oh honey, but it is just about…  What?!  Yeah. No. And you know what? Nobody even saw!  Honey I swear it we just kissed.  Okay come on Phoebe, it’s nothing! Monica, come on!  No!  No-no, it’s really not huge.  Joey, you are not! You’re 31.  Honey, Monica, this is ridiculous! Look…  Hey.  What do you think Monica mean when she said she didn’t want to talk, especially with me? I mean, why not especially you and me? We were both out there kissing.  I care!  Y’know what, I-I have to go talk to her, would you let me just get changed?  Am I going to let you watch me undress?  Monica, what did you mean before when you said you didn’t want to talk to anyone, especially me?  No-no, seriously-seriously, what was the especially me part about?  What?!  Monica, what are you talking about?  Monica, y’know what? The only reason I did that was because your party was so boring!  Oh!!  Monica, your Sweet Sixteen was like a million years ago.  Ugh, Monica I don’t want to steal your stupid thunder!  All right, easy mimey, the moment has passed, it ain’t gonna happen!  I swear, I never wanted any part of your night!  Oh wow. That—y’know what? That is so unfair. Y’know what? Now I want to steal your thunder! Come on Ross, let’s go have sex!  We’re not gonna do this, all right? She’s just gonna think that we’re doin’ it.  Who is it?  All right Monica, do you want to know why I was with Ross tonight?!  No you don’t know why!  Because! Because I was sad.  Look, I am so…so happy for you guys, but you getting married just reminds me of the fact that I’m not. I’m not even close. And I don’t know, maybe I just wanted to make myself feel better. And I know that that’s dumb, but oh my God you were so depressed when Ross got married that you slept with Chandler!  Anyway sweetie, I am, I’m so sorry I ruined your night.  Yeah.  Mon, honey, I gotta ask you something.  Ross said my name up there, I mean, come on, I just can’t pretend that didn’t happen can I?  Monica, what should I do?  What?  Whoa, wait, listen, I think I’m just gonna talk to Ross about what he think it meant.  Okay, you’re right. You’re right. You can’t help me.  Oh, hi!  Hi. Sorry, things aren’t working out so well.  Oh yeah! Of course, I mean, she’s gonna get over this, y’know? I mean, so you said my name! Y’know you just said it ‘cause you saw me there, if you’d have seen a circus freak, you would’ve said, \"I take thee circus freak.\" Y’know, it didn’t mean anything, it’s just a mistake. It didn’t mean anything. Right?  Right…  Get the hell out of there, y’know?  Well, look at that, same thing.  Okay.  Hi!  Well, Ross said my name.  Okay, Pheebs, y’know what, let’s look at this objectively all right? Ninth grade, right? The obsession starts. All right? The summer after ninth grade he sees me in a two-piece for the first time, his obsession begins to grow. So then…  Well, I-I-I’ve been on Standby for a flight home for hours.  Ohh, so no sign of Emily huh?  So umm, what time are you supposed to leave?  Yeah. I’m sorry.  No, you’re not an idiot, Ross. You’re a guy very much in love.  No, you know what, I think you should go.  Yeah, I do. I think you should go, by yourself, get some distance, clear your head, I think it’d be really good.  Oh, come on Ross! I think it would be really good for you!  Yeah.  Good!  Right!  Right!  Okay, I’ll see you back at home, if I ever get a flight out of here.  What? Wait, what?  Well-well, I don’t know Ross—really?  Uh-huh.  Oh wow, uh okay, uh maybe. Umm, yes, I can do that!  Okay!  All right!  Oh, okay, we’re going. Yeah.  Oh, wait-wait-wait…  Okay. Wait! Wait!  Hi guys! Listen I really need your help. I think I did something really stupid.  No not that. I kissed Gavin last night.  Yeah. It was after the party, we were on the balcony and...  You know we were all alone and he was being really nice to me and, oh and he gave me this scarf...  You know honey, there is a thin line between love and hate, and it turns out that line...is a scarf!  I don\\'t know. It\\'s so complicated. I work with this guy, you know, I have the baby, and I have Ross, and I just...I don\\'t  Or...I could call in sick and not deal with it at all...  Who is it?  Why?  Oh! Right! Yeah! Hold on, I\\'ll be just clean up in here a little bit! Hello Gavin  I a not gonna lie to you, I\\'m pretty sick  Oh no no no  So did I  It\\'s just a cold  What? What\\'s the matter?  Oh he\\'s dusting me with a fossil brush. He thought it would be funny.  Oh you\\'re not. You\\'re not gonna get in the middle of anything, don\\'t worry about Ross really, really.  I lied! And I\\'m not sick! Just stay behind the curtain!  Oh! Molly! You\\'re not Ross.  Right, right, yes!  What?  No! That\\'s OK! That\\'s OK! That\\'s OK! No no no no! This is my business associate Gavin. He\\'s just being silly.  OK.  I thought it was Ross.  There isn\\'t. There is totally isn\\'t.  All right. Look. Gavin...I...I guess I felt guilty that you were here, which I shouldn\\'t. You know Ross and I are not in  Yes  People keep saying that. Oh I\\'m sorry Gavin  So seriously...rodeo clown?  Oh, hey!

How long have you known her, like  Ok, Ross, what�s going on here, are we just bringing strange women back to the apartment now?  How do you know about that?  Oh, that�s what this is all about? Did you bring her up here to get back at me?  Score.  Oh God, I can�t believe you�re making such a big deal about this. It was one kiss, one guy, one time!  Yeah.  Oh yeah.  What? Who?  Whoa, how do you know about that?  Why didn�t I get that message?  From the guy in the bar, why didn�t I get that message?  Ross?  Why?  Oh God. You know what? Who you think you are? Who are you to decide what messages I should or should not get?  Yes.  Oh my God, I cannot believe this. You know I actually came in here hoping to have a mature conversation with you  Oh, Ross, this is just so messed up! What�s wrong with us? You know when people hear about our situation they  And you know, we said that we would, we would live together as long as this makes sense. An maybe this, you know,  Hi. Can Emma and I live here for a while?  Thank you.  Oh God Monica hi! I just went to your building and you weren\\'t there and then this guy with a big hammer said you might be here and you are, you are!  Hi, sure!  I knew.  I did.  Yeah, maybe...  Really?  Okay.  All right, listen, missy. If you want this cart, you\\'re gonna have to take me with it!  I could not have done this without you.  Hey, I was doin\\' great before I found out about you. You think it\\'s easy for me to see you with Julie?  Alright, fine, you go ahead and you do that, alright Ross.  \\'Cause I don\\'t need your stupid ship.  Ross do you realise this is the first time in my life I’m doing something I actually care about. This is the first time in my life I’m doing something that I’m actually good at. I mean. if you don’t get that...  Well neither do I!  Oh my God. I cannot keep having this same fight over and over again, Ross, no, you’re, you’re, you’re making this too hard.  I don’t know, I don’t know. Urrrgh! Look, maybe we should take a break.  Hi. Ohhh, you got my message.  So what do you say? Can I be your girlfriend again?  Just get out! Now!!  Okay! All right! How was she?  Was she good?  Come on Ross! You said you wanted to talk about it, let’s talk about it!! How was she?  Good different?   ...the way you owned up to everything, it just showed me how much you’ve grown. Y\\'know?  I mean my Mom never thought this would work out. It was all, “Once a cheater, always a cheater.”  Ooh, I just wish we hadn’t lost those four months, but if time was what you needed just to gain a little perspective...  You seem to really like her.  Ross, that girl just spent the entire evening talking to your friends, asking to hear stories about you, looking through Monica’s photo albums, I mean you don’t do that if you’re just in it for two weeks.  Yeah, you got like 14 hours until she has to be at the airport, and you’re sitting here in the hallway with a 28-year-old cheerleader with a fat lip.  Yeah.  What’s this? Is this Ross’s wedding invitation?  Oh, no! No you guys! Come on, you don’t have to do that! I’m happy for him! I am! I really—I’m-I’m happ—I’ll work on it.  Yeah.  Oh, honey, I don’t know. I…  No, I’ll think about it. Yeah.  Who\\'s this from?  It was like months ago. We were walking by this antique store, and I saw this pin in the window, and I told him that it was just like one my grandmother had when I was a little girl. Oh! I can\\'t believe he remembered!  What did you just say?  Oh.... my God.  Julie! Julie, isn\\'t that great? I mean, isn\\'t that just kick- you-in-the-crotch, spit-on-your-neck fantastic?   She didn\\'t hang up either...  Ohh, ohh.  Well, basically, lately, I\\'ve uh, I\\'ve uh, sort of had feelings for you.  Really?  Oh, god.  Oh it\\'s OK. You were worth the wait, and I don\\'t just mean tonight.  Ah, oh God. Oh, honey, oh that\\'s OK.  Yeah, because I was mad at you, not because I stopped loving you!  Noo.  Noo! Maybe! I, I don’t know.  I just, I feel, I-I just...  Y\\'know I can’t believe I even thought about getting back together again! We are so over!!  And hey! Just so you know, it’s not that common! It doesn’t happen to every guy! And it is a big deal!!  Oh my God.  Oh.  I can\\'t go to my own prom without a date, I can\\'t, it\\'s too late.  Yeah. It’s just gonna be too hard. Y’know? I mean, it’s Ross. How can I watch him get married? Y’know it’s just, it’s for the best, y’know it is, it’s… Y’know, plus, somebody’s got to stay here with Phoebe! Y’know she’s gonna be pretty big by then, and she needs someone to help her tie her shoes; drive her to the hospital in case she goes into labour.  Joey, if you wanna look good, why don\\'t you just come down to the store? I\\'ll help you out.  What?  Well maybe, maybe she\\'s with us right now?  Okay now Joey, y\\'know that since you\\'re returning all of this stuff right after the audition you\\'re gonna have to wear underwear?  It\\'s not a purse! It\\'s a shoulder bag.  Exactly! Unisex!  No! No Joey! U-N-I-sex.  Joey, y\\'know you get any mustard on that bag, you can\\'t return it.  All right, then you owe me $350.  Hey, don\\'t listen to them. I think it\\'s sexy.  Hi sweetie!  Why?! Why not?!  Okay.  Ahhh, I think you look great! That bag is gonna get you that part.  Ooh, Pheebs, what are you gonna say? Are you gonna tell him who you are?  What?! Why? Joey you were so ready for it!  …I just don\\'t know if the world is ready for you and your bag.  Oh, hi.  Well, there was a disaster in shipping and I’ve got to get this order in. Honey, I’m so sorry, but it looks like I’m gonna be here all night.  No-no-no, no, honey please, I’ve got, I’ve just have so much to deal with.  Ross honey, this is very nice, but, but I-I got a crisis.  Honey, honey, I’m sorry, I know it’s our anniversary but I told you on the phone I don’t have time to stop.  Ross you’re not listening to me, I don’t have time to stop.  I don’t have ten minutes!!  Hey, Ross!!! I told you I don’t!  Good bye!  Hi. Look um, about what happened earlier...  You had no right coming down to my office Ross. You do not bring a picnic basket to somebody’s work! Unless maybe they were a park ranger!  But I told you, I didn’t have the time!  Wh, Ross what do you want from me? You want me, you want me to quit my job so you can feel like you have a girlfriend?  Just a job!  Ross do you realise this is the first time in my life I’m doing something I actually care about. This is the first time in my life I’m doing something that I’m actually good at. I mean. if you don’t get that...  Well neither do I!  Oh my God. I cannot keep having this same fight over and over again, Ross, no, you’re, you’re, you’re making this too hard.  I don’t know, I don’t know. Urrrgh! Look, maybe we should take a break.  No! Sorry, I just thought you were somebody else. Hi!  Yeah. Well, umm.....  No! Really, no, please, please, that’s, that’s okay.  Oh, yeah, I’m not, I’m not hungry.  Oh. Okay, bye.  Oh, and then, we got into this big, stupid fight. I just, it was awful. I told him he treats me like a park ranger, or something, oh and then I told him I wanted to take a break, I don’t want to take a break.  Oh, thank you that’s very helpful, I’m glad you came over.  Hello.  Hi! Oh, I’m so glad you called.  Nobody.  Umm, honey, look he just came over to....  Um, Mon, Chandler�s not here.  Okay, well that�s now the third sign that I should not leave Emma.  Well, let�s see. The first one is: I don�t want to. And, you know, I�m not going.  She is?  Ish. I just don�t think I can bear it.  Uch.  Oh-A.  You need to learn some new slang.  I was just going to say that I left my keys.  No. Uch.  Alright, I can�t, I can�t wait that long. You have to do something�knock that door down!  What if she jumped out the bassinet?  Oh my god, I left the water running.  Ah, did I leave the stove on?  Is the window open? Because if there�s a window open, a bird could fly in there.  Ubb.  Boy, are you gonna be sorry if that�s true.  Oh no. I mean it. After what just happened, I�m never leaving her again.  We got locked out of the apartment, we �  N-it wasn�t easy, but it�s your birthday and I did what I got to do.  Oh honey, this is for the best, thus I�m not distracted, worrying about Emma, how she�s doing at home and I�m being completely here with you and, oh, she spit up!  Oh, ooh, everything looks delicious. What should I ha-ave? What should I have?  Yah, I�ll have the soup and the salmon.  Y�guys ever heard the story about when Rosses mom went to the beauty salon?  N-no, Emma dropped her sock.  Ross, she still has not noticed that the baby�s sock is on the ground.  Phoebe, hi, we�re so sorry. You�re totally right. We are here one hundred per cent and we love you and we are ready to start your birthday celebration.  What?  Oh thank god, if Phoebe�s going, can we please take Emma home?  Yeah?  May fifth, why?  Ross, you guys went out once. You took your kids to Chucky Cheese, and you didn\\'t even kiss her.  Well, have fun!  Yeah, she\\'s...  You love her.  Ross, didn\\'t you ah, play soccer in High School? Oh no wait, that\\'s right. You just organized their game schedules on your Commodore 64.  I know, isn\\'t he great? It\\'s so nice to finally be in a fun relationship, y\\'know? There\\'s nothing boring about him, and ah, I bet he\\'s never set foot in a museum.  Y\\'know what else is really great about him, oh, what is the word for the adult that doesn\\'t have dinosaur toys in their bedroom?  What was that?  I think he\\'s stealing from me.  Because he\\'s stealing from me!  Well where\\'s Amanda?  I mean y\\'know, I\\'m thinking. You could bring her, and you guys could go up to your old room, and not make out.  Why don\\'t you just marry her? Oh no, wait a minute you can\\'t, I\\'m sorry I forgot, she\\'s not a lesbian.  Sorry.  Y\\'know...  Yeah.  No!  Nooo Way! The most romantic song ever is The Way We Were.  What song was that, Pheebs?  Hey Mon!  No, it\\'s been three nights in a row.  What?!  Monica, you broke up with him for a reason.  Well, you know I\\'m not surprised. I mean have you seen them together, they\\'re really cute.  Yes, Joey, I remember, she\\'s annoying, but you know what she\\'s-she\\'s his girlfriend now. I mean what can we do?  Do you still have that, um, Navy uniform?  Hmm.  You remember not having sex in high school, right?  Well honey, what about you?  I mean do you have any fun, you know, fantasy type things?  Come on you gotta have one!  Ross, you know what...  ...if you tell me, I might do it.  Yeah.  Oooh!  Really!  Did you ever do the-the Leia thing?  Really! That-that great huh?  Hi you guys!  Mon. Hi!  Why aren\\'t you at work?  Why?  You really, really need to get some sleep, honey.  Hi.  What?  Oh, really, let me see, let me see.  Ross, I didn\\'t think it would that big of a deal.  Okay, who are you talking to when you do that?  Okay, Ross, Phoebe is my girlfriend, okay, we tell each other everything. You know, I mean, come on, guys do the same thing, I mean, what about all that locker room stuff.  Were both of those Joey?  Not even with your best friend.  That is so sad. Your missing out on so much, Ross. I mean, the bonding and the sharing, you know. And-and knowing that someone else is going through the same thing you are.  Pretty much.  Uh, honey, yeah that was with Carol.  Okay, here we go. I\\'m Jabba\\'s prisoner, and you have a really weird look on your face. What? Honey, what is it? Did I get it wrong? Did I get the hair wrong? What? Did you just picture it differently? What? What?  Hello  Oh that couldn\\'t have been pretty. but you know guys do that.  Nooooooooo!  well watching sharks? Are you sure that\\'s what he was doing?  man sharks. I always knew there was something weird about that dude. But you promised to love him no matter what.  Ah! You know what honey guys are just different, they like things that we can\\'t understand, you know I once dated this guy who wanted to pretend he was an archeologist and I was a naughty cave woman that he unfroze from a block of ice.  yeah I didn\\'t disguise that very well did i.  so basically you\\'ve slept with all the woman in New York and now you\\'re just going around again.  what, how do we know, we never slept with you.  yeah your both so slutty you don\\'t even remember who you\\'ve slept with, you\\'re made for each other.  Hi!  Hey, do you guys have any extra ribbon?  I, uh, think you already are.  Yeah, yeah I like him a lot.  Yeah, otherwise I’m not going.  This is such a great party! 35 years. Very impressive, do you guys have any pearls of wisdom?  Hmmm….  Thank you…we’re so excited  Yeah, if you’re going to do the ears, you might as well take a pass at the nosal area.  No, I know I don’t either, but ya know what, it’s their party, and it’s just one night. And we don’t even have to lie; we just won’t say anything. If it comes up again, we’ll just…smile. We’ll nod along.  Oh…  Open it! Open it! Open it!  But it was beautiful. I mean it was small, but kind of spectacular.  On a cliff, in Barbados, at sunset, and Stevie Wonder sang Isn’t She Lovely as I walked down the aisle.  So would I. You wouldn’t think that Annie Liebawitz would forget to put film in the camera.  What? I’m not you. This may be the only wedding I ever have. I want it to be amazing.  Okay, Ross, it has to be realistic.  And my veil was lace, made by blind, Belgium nuns.  Well, not at first, but it was very intricate work and they said even though they lost their sight, it was all worth it.  Well, I don’t know about that, but some said that I looked like a floating angel.  Oh yeah. That’s a great story.  Shhh! I want to hear the rest!  Ross, it just wouldn’t have been feasible.  It was really fun being married to you tonight.  Okay Ross, can I uh, can I ask you something?  That proposal, at the planetarium…  Are you kidding?! With the, with the lilies, and-and the song, and the stars! It was…really wonderful! Did you just make that up?  Well, that would’ve been very hard to say no too.  Goodnight  I will think about it.  What\\'s going on?  Oh okay, hey guys, would you flip mine too?  Oh yeah! I know.  Oh my God, Le Poo, our dog!  It\\'s Le Poo.  What?  Sorry. Sorry.  Yeah, I know. It\\'s ridiculous! I can\\'t see you either.  Hi!  Okay, what\\'s up?  Yeah, I told you to give Emily whatever she wants.  Yeah?  Ohh! Lucky me! Oh my God! That is good news, Ross! I think that\\'s the best news I\\'ve heard since Le Poo died!  Oh yeah, really? Is it Ross? Yeah? Okay, well let me make this a just a little bit easier for you.  Storming out!  Yeah, well that\\'s how mad I am!!  Look, I know you guys heard about the whole thing with me and Ross but y\\'know, I\\'ve been obsessing about it all day and I\\'d just love not to talk about it. All right?  That\\'s not Ross!  Oh my God, its happening. It\\'s already started. I\\'m Kip.  See? Yeah, you told me the story. He and Monica dated when they broke up they couldn\\'t even be in the same room together and you all promised that you would stay his friend and what happened? He got phased out!  Honey, come on! You live far away! You\\'re not related. You lift right out.  Wherever I go. Come on you and me, we\\'ll-we\\'ll start a new group, we\\'re the best ones.  Hi. What are you doing here? Isn\\'t this against the rules?  Oh, Ross…  No, it\\'s not better. I still don\\'t get to see you.  Well, for starters I would\\'ve said the right name at my wedding!  I know.  I know that too.  Uh-huh!  What is that noise?  Well, I’ve been up since six. Thanks to somebody’s dumb-ass rooster.  Yeah! Especially not with all of these knives and cookbooks around…  What?  I’m so not impressed. Everybody snacks when they shop.  How many guesses do you get?  No! There’s no orange juice in there! We win!!  Okay, well, we won that one.  Yeah, and none of these stupid grocery questions, real personal questions.  Fine! We’ll ask Phoebe.  I know! I know, it’s such a huge, life-altering thing.  Tails!  We’ll take Literature!!  Chandler gets it! It’s Chandler Bing!  Monica, I don’t want to lose 200 dollars.  Monica?!  Okay, so let’s play for some pepper! Stop spending my money!  Oooohh that’s interesting.  Throw in the duck too!  Well, he gets the other one all riled up.  Monica, betting the apartment, I don’t know about this.  Why? Do you have the answers written on there?  All right, let’s do it.  All right!  14?  Space cowboy!  Oh gosh, it has something to do with numbers.  He carries a briefcase.  Oh-oh-oh, he’s a transponce—transpondster!  Oh my God.  Well I-I-I’m not moving.  No, it was a stupid bet! We were just playing a game!  Noooo.  What?!  I don’t care, I’m not going anywhere.  That’s right! You do what the hand says!  How did it go?  Y’know what, you are mean boys, who are just being mean!  That is not true. She did! She forced me!  Well it stupid, unfair question!  Will you stop calling it your apartment!  No it’s not!  Oh, I think I saw some in here.  I don’t know! But maybe if we keep that drawer shut, it’ll die.  Ohh, are you setting Ross up with someone? Does she have a wedding dress?  Hey.  Yeah.  Well, sure, but they might think it’s kinda weird considering I don’t work there anymore.  I-I, got a job at Ralph Lauren.  But, Pheebs, you can still use the copy machine where I actually work. But, just come by at lunch so my boss doesn’t see you. Cause Kim will just freak out and she already doesn’t like me very much.  Sure.  Oh my God. Did you talk to him?  What? What!?! You kissed him?  Phoebe, I mean, you do know he’s married?  Phoebe…  So you know, I…I handed in that marketing report and I never got to hear what you thought.  Ahh….So…Wow…The spring line, it’s really going to be great this year, huh?  Yeah I know. She ran into him at my office and they just…made out. And the craziest thing is, now my boss likes me because I told her about it and she said it was the best gossip she’d heard all year.  What?  Oh My God, Phoebe, that’s not Ralph Lauren. That’s Kenny the copy guy.  Oh..Go..Oh..and I told my boss that someone made out with Ralph Lauren. If she finds out that I lied to her, she is going to hate me even more. Phoebe!!  To get you to make out with him!!!  Ohh, hi, Kim.  Yeah, remember that thing I told you that happened yesterday? Well it didn’t happen.  Okay, two things didn’t happen. Remember I told you that someone made out with Ralph Lauren in the copy room? Well, it turns out that’s not true.  No.  Oh no, no, no. Oh God, you think I made out with him.  Now, she thinks that I made out with him and I did it to get her job.  I did but she doesn’t think anyone would be stupid enough to confuse Kenny the copy guy with Ralph Lauren.  You were with Kenny today, weren’t you?  Ohh, Phoebe, what am I going to do?  I’m not going to sleep with Ralph Lauren. I mean, I could, but I wouldn’t.  That wouldn’t help me.  Kim, hi.  Okay..Okay.. Look. I’m sorry that I lied to you before. You were right. Ralph and I were an item but were not anymore.  Of course it’s true and it hurts so bad.  You and Ralph?  Yeah, kicking a guy in the crotch all morning really takes it out of ya!  Yeah!  Isn’t that a kind of sushi?  Ohh! I would kill for a salmon skin roll right now!  Well, Valentine’s Day was like two weeks ago, so I wouldn’t get her a calendar!  Aw, I love that.  Hey, wait a minute! That is my sock!  What the hell was that?!  All right, so we weren’t prepared!  Yep!  Oh, of course!  Definitely! Phoebe, you will not find a single game show host, who’s ass I cannot kick.  Say it!  Say it!  Oh my God! Why is he jumping on those women!  I… Well, I don’t think they need any help.  Yeah, whoosh!  So uh, what are you guys doing for dinner tonight?  Do you guys ever get the feeling that um, Chandler and those guys just don\\'t get that we don\\'t make as much money as they do?  For Ross, Ross, Ross.  Hey.  What?  Oh, you know what, we haven\\'t even looked yet.  Yeah, these are pretty ch-ching.  Uh, I don\\'t know. Why don\\'t you put it right here next to my water?  Um, everyone?  Ok, look you guys, I really don\\'t want to get into this right now. I think it\\'ll just make everyone uncomfortable.  That\\'s \\'cause you have it.  Basically, there\\'s the thing, and then there\\'s the stuff after the thing.  Ok.  Thank you.  Ross, you have to understand that your nice thing makes us feel this big.  Ok, we never shoulda talked about this.  Me neither.  What? Come on, you do what you want to do. Do we always have to do everything together?  Fine.  Happy birthday.  Oh, well, it pretty much sucked. How was yours?  Oh yeah. I used to babysit him. Hey, how\\'s his dad?  On someone\\'s lips? Where\\'d you get the hickey?  What party?  Who gave you that hickey?  Oh!  What, as part of your poor friends outreach program?  Oh!  Oh... Oh, I\\'m sorry! I\\'m not... I was just-I was just reading to Emma.  Yeah, yeah... It\\'s... \"climax your way to better skin\".  Yeah...  Oh, well...  Ok, uh-uh... Let\\'s-Let\\'s shop!!  Which you\\'re not, because you\\'ve totally hung up on him!  And you\\'re gonna want him to eat his heart out so you\\'re gonna have to look fabulous!  Hey Pheebs, I\\'m-I\\'m taking Charlie shopping, why don\\'t you come and I\\'ll help you find something.  That\\'s not what we\\'re gonna do!  Hi! Ok, you\\'re ready to go pick up Phoebe and go shopping?  Not gonna find any clothes in there!  Hi.  Oh... you\\'re not gonna do a magic trick, are ya?  I\\'m there!  Pheebs, that\\'s for men!  On Melanie Griffith in \"Working girl\". I think what you want is over here.  Really?  Oh, I can\\'t. Because I-I\\'ve seen them.  Yeah! I\\'m a big fan! Of the movies, you know. Motion pictures. The Talkies!  Sure!  You know that depends on what it is! I\\'ve done a lot of stuff.  She\\'s ok, I just don\\'t get a really good vibe from her!  I don\\'t know, you know, just the way she waltzed in here all smart, and tall! You know, and just swept Joey off his feet... I mean, nobody else has a chance!  Anybody! You, me, you know, Monica\\'s mom...  Shhhhh! Phoebe! All right, look. I have a little thing for him.  It\\'s just physical and I have it totally under control! Ok? It\\'s just, when I see them together, sometimes I just get a little jealous!  I know, I know, so it is just not a big deal.  So can we keep this between us?  Ok, great, because I gotta get out of here, the smell of beets is killing me!  Oh, God, do you think she heard? It would be so bad if she heard!  Ok, great!  Oh, thank God I can\\'t hear a word that you\\'re saying!  Ok well, I heard that! Which means that she heard it too!  Oh! What are we gonna do?  Oh my God!  Alright! Let\\'s just do it. Let\\'s just go over there and see if she heard.  Oh God. You did. You heard. Ok, listen, let me explain.  Yeah! That\\'s Phoebe. That\\'s Phoebe. You know, she just wants them all! It\\'s like she\\'s a nympho!  Yeah...  No, that\\'s David.  Yeah, so let’s get started on the wedding plans!  Yeah, we got a lot to do! We gotta think about the flowers, the caterers, the music…  Oh wait Chandler, too many cooks…  Okay.  Aw.  What?! The duck?! What the hell did the damn duck do now?!  Joey, there is a perfectly good couch across the hall!  What?!  Now Joey, what did the duck do?!  Hey Joey, what ‘cha doing?  No.  Joey, did you my face cream?  Joey, what-what are you doing going into my bedroom?!  Well what happened at dinner?  Wait, but there’s no money! Well this is terrible! You guys are gonna have to get married in like a, rec. center!  Do you even understand what off the rack means?!  Well what?! How-how much is it?!  Uh-huh, I get it, smoke, chimney, chimney sweep, very funny, ha-ha.  Well no, I don’t smell anything.  Nothing!  Y’know, I can not believe you told him, Joey!  Who are you supposed to be?  Do you even know what a vicar is?  All right! Y’know what? That’s it! You wanna do it?! Let’s do it!  Yeah that’s right! Come on Joey; sex me up!'},\n {'character': 'Tag',\n  'concatenated_lines': \"I just did them.  What?  Yeah, I filled them out last night?  Good morning.  Oh yeah! We went to the Knicks game.  Then we went to this bar and he hooked us up with all these women!  Well kinda old, like 30.  And I never used to be able to just talk to girls in bars, but I got like 20 phone numbers last night.  A little.  Hey Joey, you wanted to talk to me?  Oh, yeah, this is from Rachel.  Really?  Good morning Rachel.  Went out with Joey.  No. We had a really good talk. I don’t think I’m gonna do that bar scene anymore.  It’s just not really who I am. Y'know, I’ve always been happier when…Why am I telling you this? You don’t care about this stuff.  When I’m in a relationship, I love having a girlfriend.  Someone I can spoil, y’know?  Uh-huh! Let me ask you something?  Do you believe that there is one perfect person for everyone?  And if that person is already in your life, you should do something about it right?  All right then, it’s settled.  I’m gettin’ back together with my ex-girlfriend.  What?  I, uh, wanted to see if your offer to spend Thanksgiving with you is still good.  We kinda broke up this morning.  Yeah, so she went back to Ohio.  You don't like puppies?  Hey.  Not bad.  Thanks.  A year. On and off. I kinda thought we'd end up together. I don't anymore.  Yeah.  It's weird. I always used to assume, that I would meet someone and fall in love and be happy and all that was just a given. But lately it's like what if it's not. Do you ever have that feeling?  Why?  You have all the answers, don't you?  Hey, thanks for talking to me.  What?  What did Joey say? I like you back?  Wait-wait a minute; that doesn't make any sense.  I'm okay. I gotta go down to the police station and look at mug shots.  Thanks for having me over, you guys.  Colorado.  Okay.  Um, I'm not.  No, you didn't. The only thing that freaked me out was you saying that nothing could ever happen between us.  Hey, I wonder if you can see my apartment from up here.  What?  Sure.  What contracts?  Like what?  Rach, I’m sorry, but you didn’t give me any contracts!  I’m telling you, you never gave them to me.  No, I would see you looking embarrassed because they are not on my desk!  You wanna go down to the office right now?  Okay! Feel free to look, but I’m telling you those contracts are not on this desk.  It’s my sister.  So when do you imagine you gave them to me? In the morning or in the afternoon?  It’s not here.  How could I have left them in the copy room?  Fine.  Still no luck.  Do you want me to check again?  Well, it’s not out here. Is there any chance it could be in your office?  I did not!  How did you know they were in my bottom drawer?  That’s it. That’s my whole name.  I know I haven’t worked in an office before, and I really don’t have a lot of experience, but uh…  It’s lame, I know. But I’m a goal-oriented person, very eager to learn…  Anyway, I’m guessing you hired somebody.  What?  I am?!  I can’t believe it!  Hi! Rachel Green’s office.  Phoebe! That’s a great name.  Do you have a minute?  I got asked out twice today when I was at lunch…by guys.  Yeah. Did you tell someone that I was gay?  But I’m not gay. And I especially wouldn’t want you to think I was gay.  I don’t think I should say.  Okay.  Well…  I’d love to ask out your friend Phoebe.  Hey Rach.  So, what’s this about?  What’s going on Rach?  I’m ready for more.  Come on Rach, let’s give it another try.  Good! Good, long time no see.  Like your sweater.  Oh, it’s crazy about Rachel huh?  So whose is it?  Okay.  Yes, at 4:00.  I’d better get back to my desk.  My what?  Are you serious?  No! It was marked confidential I just sent it down to Human Resources.  A joke they would appreciate?  What did you say?!  No, not my touchie.  That’s kinda sad.  Got it!  No, don’t worry about it.  Are you kidding me?! With a cute butt like this, I’d find work.  Y’know what?  Look Rachel, I know what you’re going through. I’m totally freaked about turning 25.  Why? What you’d do?  It wasn’t on your list, but hopefully you’ll think it’s really fun.  Hey.  How are you doing? Are you feeling any better?  What’s up?  Rachel, don’t do this. This is just because you’re turning thirty.  Twenty-four actually.  Me too.\"},\n {'character': 'Melissa',\n  'concatenated_lines': 'Hey Rachel!  Umm, is Tag here?  Oh, I was gonna talk to him about doing something tonight.  Well, we’ve been flirting back and forth, but I was hoping that tonight it would turn into something a little more than that.  Oh no!  Hey! Isn’t that Tag’s backpack.  You have been M.I.A for the past seven sorority newsletters, what’s up with you?!  Shut up!  Oh shut up more! Now, are you friends with Ralph?  Listen, we-we have to have dinner. What-what are you doing tomorrow night?  You do now. You’re having dinner with me.  Oh no, that’s-that’s an old card. Umm, I wanted to get out of that and-and do something where I can really help people and-and make a difference.  Hmm Phoebe, were you ever in a sorority?  What one?  Yeah?  Oh wow, Ray-ray I have no idea what you’re talking about.  I don’t know. I don’t remember a lot of things that never happened.  I’m sorry Ray-ray. I mean if I thought it happened I would say it. Maybe I passed out and you did stuff to me while I was sleeping.  She didn’t.  My God! You love me!'},\n {'character': 'Joey',\n  'concatenated_lines': 'All right, I guess this will be fine.  Nothing, why?  Huh, Rach I got to say it’s gonna take a lot of money for me to go out on a date with a dude.  Really? ‘Cause I could kinda use the money.  Yeah, okay.  All right, all right, all right, all right, you wanna know what I do when I take resume shots?  Hey!  Yeah! That guy’s all right!  What?  Hey well, you can’t teach someone to be good with women. Y’know, that’s why I never had any luck with Chandler.  Hey! No-no-no-no, you can’t take him away from me! I got a great partner to pick up girls with! Finally!!  I know, Monica told me.  I don’t know Rach.  I don’t know. You uh, you got something for me?  Ten. Okay. Now Tag there’s such a thing as to many women.  Yeah, for you!  Yeah, we look great together.  Y’know, we don’t have to imagine.  We’ll just see.  Oh no, I\\'m sure the Xerox machine caught a few.  Shut up!  Thank you.  There was chocolate on the three. It looked like an eight, alright?  Yeah, we just don\\'t happen to know any women that know how to play poker.  About what?  Heh... I was bluffing.  You know what, you guys? It\\'s their first time, why don\\'t we just forget about the money, alright?  No, I don\\'t think so, see Ross, because I think you love her.  Alright now listen, you guys, we talked about it, and if you don\\'t want to play, we completely understand.  But hey, thanks for teachin\\' us Cross-Eyed Mary. You guys, we gotta play that at our regular game.  What?  That\\'s fine. I\\'ll just have a Tic-Tac to hold me over.  Uh... Phoebe? Phoebe?  Me too. Alright, whattaya got.  Look, Rachel, we don\\'t have to do this.  Check.  That\\'s OK, Ross, you can ask me. What?  Oh!  Say hello to the new champ of Chandler\\'s dumb states game.  Fifty-six!  Hey! How is New England not a state? Huh? They have a sports-team!  46. Wow! Who\\'s well educated now, Mr. I-forgot-ten-states?  But the drawer full of take-out menus is okay, right?  Don\\'t worry, Chandler, it\\'s not a globe of the United States.  What the hell is in there?  Yeah that dog left!  Look, Chandler, I told you, never tell anyone about this dog thing. It\\'s like Ross not likin’ ice cream.  All right, Rach, the big question is, does he like you? All right? Because if he doesn\\'t like you, this is all a moo-point.  Yeah, it\\'s like a cow\\'s opinion. It just doesn\\'t matter. It\\'s moo.  Fine! Take their advice. No one ever listens to me. When the package is this pretty, no one cares what\\'s inside.  So? Bring the dog back, you\\'re a hero.  Chandler, it\\'s like a big gerbil.  Ross, you need some help?  Hey! Tag\\'s still talking to the police.  If you said it like that, you probably did, yeah.  Oh No-no-no-no-no-no-no! He went over to Ross\\' to bring the dog back here!  You think?  Oh, I got it! How about saying something like, \"Monica…  \"…when I look back over our time together…\"  Well, I can’t do everything! Look back over your time together.  Hey!  How is \"Monica, I love your sweet ass,\" inappropriate?  Hey, it\\'s me! I\\'m comin\\' in!  Ahh, I\\'m gonna go get some chicken. Want some?  Okay.  I know! I mean it’s not like we weren’t cool about it.  How?! When?!  IN LONDON!!!  But it is a big deal!! I have to tell someone!  All right! Man, this is unbelievable!  Yes, but y\\'know what? It doesn\\'t matter who knows what. Now, enough of us know that we can just tell them that we know! Then all the lying and the secrets would finally be over!  Well I didn\\'t tell them!  Uhhh, Phoebe and Joey.  And Rachel. I would\\'ve told you but they made me promise not to tell!  No.  They know you know.  I couldn\\'t even if I wanted too.  Ooh!  It\\'s not my first time.   So that\\'s it! It\\'s over! Everybody knows!  I don’t want them to move to a Volvo dealership!  I’m sorry, I just…I like things the way they are.  Ooh, look-look-look-look-look! I got Monica naked!  Hey.  Yeah, you can get a Volvo. If that’s what you really want.  Hey!  What? I don’t get it.  If he goes first he can!  Yeah, we know, but there\\'s a baby suckin\\' on it.  Uh, does it hurt?  Chandler?  Ok, I got one, I got one. Uh, if he blows into one, does the other one get bigger?  Monica what\\'re you doin\\'? You can\\'t go shopping with her? What about Rachel?  Who?  What\\'s he doin\\' in my section?  Listen, I know you\\'re new, but it\\'s kinda understood that everything from Young Men\\'s to the escalator is my territory.  Yeah. Bijan for men?  Yeah, it\\'s kinda sweet, sorta like, uh...  Exactly.  Yeah I guess you\\'re right.  Yeah, I\\'m ready.  These new kids, they never last. Sooner or later, they all...stop lastin\\'. Listen, uh, what do you say I buy you that cup of coffee now?  Well, I was thinking about that and I, I think the best way would be, to not.  It’ll kill him. I mean it’ll, it’ll just kill him.  What did they do?  Hey-hey, Ross?  I’ve got a science question.  If the Homo Sapiens, were in fact ‘Homo-sapien’, is that why there extinct?  Hey-hey, I’m not judging.  I’d really prefer a mountain bike.  Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait, whoa. Do you ah, want to get her something speacial, get her flowers, get her candy, get her gum, girls love gum.  Oh, you want something serious. Y\\'know what you should do, you should get her one of those um, barium enemas. Those are dead serious.  Oh God. Uh, okay, here’s the thing, this is the thing, okay, the thing is...  Okay. I went down to the ‘Mattress King’ showroom and, and I saw Janice, kissing her ex-husband.  They were in his office.  I’m telling you man, I saw it.  I’m not wrong! I wish I was. I’m sorry. Bet that barium enema doesn’t sound so bad now, huh?  You said number two.  Uh.  I’m tellin’ ya, he hasn’t moved since this morning.  Well, there is one way. His window’s open, I say, we poke him.  Hey! Y\\'know how we ah, save all those chopsticks for no reason we get when we get Chinese food?  Well, now we got a reason.  Well, we’re fashioning a very long poking device.  Hey uh, what’s a matter?  Oh my God, is she going back to him?  What are you ah, what are you gonna do?  Well, it doesn’t matter what I would do.  They have a kid together, y\\'know. They’re like, they’re like a family, and if, I don’t know, there’s chance they could make that work, I know I wouldn’t want to be the guy who stood in the way of that. Are you okay? Do you wanna ah, come poke a nude guy?  All right now remember, something this big and long is going to be difficult to manuver, fortunately I have a lot of experience in that area.  Okay, retract the device, retract the device.  Hey, that’s never gonna make it all the way over here, buddy!  Don\\'t you put words in people\\'s mouths, you put turkey in people\\'s mouths!  Three tickets to today\\'s Rangers game!!  Oh.  Yeah, they\\'re great seats too!  Center ice.  So we\\'ll leave before it\\'s over, we\\'ll be back in time.  Dude, two times that happened!  Right, I guess. Alright, so see you at four.  Yeah!  Oh, Bob, get off the guy!  I know, yeah.  Ohhhh! These seats are great!  I don\\'t know...  Okay.  How late are we?  Oh, no, no, no, no, no. You just want to put it on your hand!  You are not at Thanksgiving?  Yeah, where were you!  Wait a second, wait a second, where have I seen that cowgirl outfit before...  All right. Hey Rach, while you\\'re in there, throw something on Alicia Mae.  I hate that thing, it\\'s like a... bolt of lightning.  That\\'s fire. Beats everything.  Ooh! Well played, Phoebe Buffay, well played.  Oh! It all looks so beautiful: the turkey, the stuffing...  Hey! I\\'m getting a little tired of this okay? We said we\\'re sorry. It\\'s Thanksgiving for Pete\\'s sakes! A day of forgiveness!  Fine! Let\\'s just go. I don\\'t need your stupid dinner.  Sorry!  Yeah! You three have a nice Thanksgiving.  Yeah! You, Chan, and the vein!  Ha!  Oh-oh! I\\'m stuck!  No seriously... I\\'m really wedged in here.  Alright, hurry up, you gotta do something.  I just wanna say that I\\'m sorry I referred to the vein as a seperate person...  Oh, that smells good!  Okay.  It isn\\'t working.  Well hurry, I can\\'t feel my ears!  Interesting...  I left them at the park.  It\\'s really starting to hurt.  Ooh! Stop putting things down my pants!  Yeah! Come on!  Oh, I know how you feel...  Sure. I went through the exact same thing with Alicia Mae Emory... The waiting, the wandering... Then one day... I get that call from Toys \"R\" Us... She was in stock!  There’s the waitress. Excuse me, Miss. Hello, Miss?  No, no... how come you are working here?  I’m sayin’ I see a difference.  I don’t care. Phoebe’s Phoebe. Ursula’s... hot!  Yeah.  Hey Pheebs, guess who we saw today.  Nope.  Nope.  Not from where I was standin’.  I went back to Riff’s. I think Ursula likes me. All I ordered was coffee, she brought me a tuna meltt and four plates of curly fries.  She is so hot!  Pheebs?  You think it would be okay if I asked out your sister?  So that if we went out on a date, she’d be there.  Cool, thanks.  Hey.  Phoebe, could you do me a favour? Could you try this on? I just wanna make sure it fits.  Oh, no no no. It’s for Ursula. I just figured, you know, size-wise.  Yep. Ice Capades.  I don’t know. I like her, you know. She’s different. There’s uh, somethin’ about her.  Hey, Phoebe, I asked you, and you said it was okay.  Okay... Well maybe now I’m not okay with it not being okay.  Out.  Well, not that it’s any of your business, but, no, we haven’t, okay?  You meant sex, right?  Hey. Y\\'know with that goatee you kinda look like Satan.  Hey I was crying because, because nobody believed Quincy’s theory. Okay?  Saw a girl with that vest.  I got you something! Open it! Open it!  It’s cute, huh?  Hey.  How’s she doing?  Well yeah, don’t-don’t you think it’s a she?  Well, anyway, I got to go change, I’m ah, meeting some of the cast for drinks.  What?  Hey! Who was up from 2 o’clock this morning until 5 o’clock this morning trying to get her back to sleep?  Ohhh, here it comes.  Hey!! I need to relax! Okay? I was working all day!  That’s not what I said. Okay, I just meant...  I don’t know, maybe we weren’t ready to have a chick.  Do you think we’ll get our three bucks back?  Well, the brown one brings out your eyes, but your butt looks great in the blue one.  Okay, good, good, good, ‘cause, good, ‘cause I was kinda having second thoughts too.  That’s horrible! Well, you did the right thing man.  What ‘cha doing?  What about the chick?  Are you sure?  Sure.  Well, that’s really a different question.  Well, there was that one time that Monica and Rachel got together.  Okay, but let’s say there was. How might that go?  Hey, there’s a dog out there!  Don’t you ah, don’t you wanna ask me any questions?  Well, ah, I’m an actor. I’m fairly neat. I ah, I got my own TV. Oh, and don’t worry I’m totally okay with the gay thing.  Ah, y\\'know just in general people being gay, thing. I’m totally cool with that.  Hey!  Whew! Stood up to fast, got a little head rush.  That’s a uh, that’s a tough combination.  Gotcha.  Oh, you bet I am!  You said, you wanna come in for some lemonade?  Whoa, ah!! We’re you just gonna give me some lemonade?  Oh right, right.  Well usually...yeah! Well, not just lemonade, iced tea, sometimes juice. Well, sorry, I just, I thought you liked me. I’m such a jerk.  Baywatch.  Lifeguards.  Nicole Eggert. You\\'ll like her.  They do that a lot. Hey, you want a beer?  No, no, no, don’t get up, I got a cooler right here.  Cool!!  Whoa, wait, Pheebs, wait a second! Don’t you wanna stay here and talk about it?  Oh no! No!! My hole!!  Yeah, and I’m a little tired from digging the hole.  Well, there’s really only one thing you can do.  You’re gonna have to pee on it.  Don’t blame me, I saw it on The Discovery Channel.  If you want some privacy you can use my hole.  Me too.  No?  It’s between us and the sea, Ross!  Nope.  Well, we have to say something! We have to get it out! It’s eating me alive!! Monica got stung by a jellyfish.  And I was tired from digging the huge hole!  I’d seen this thing on The Discovery Channel...  That’s right I stepped up! She’s my friend and she needed help! And if I had too, I’d pee on anyone of you! Only, uhh, I couldn’t. I got the stage fright. I wanted to help, but there was too much pressure. So-so I uh, I turned to Chandler.  Maybe I could give thanks for you shuttin’ up, eh?  Well maybe I love ya’.  Yeah! Yeah, why? What’s up?  Ye-ye, we go to yours!  How you got three women to marry you, I’ll never know.  Oh, ooh the food smells great, Mon!  Yeah, hey hey, Happy Thanksgiving everybody!  Well, this has been great!  Uh, some of her friends, yeah.  Yeah, yeah, and the Indians taught the Pilgrims what it meant to be hot in the new world!  Rach, you’re killin’ us here, will ya serve the dessert already? Those drunken dancers are waiting!  Y-sure!  I know, and only one layer of jam?! What is up with that?  Just let her serve the beef-custard thing?  Did-did it make you wanna walk around in your underwear?  Well you’re whippin’ so slow! Can’t you do it any faster?  Oh I am!  Ross! Can I talk to you for a second?  Okay, look, I think we have to tell Rachel she messed up her dessert.  Look, when everyone eats that...that...Banana-Meat thing, they’re all gonna’ make fun of her, do you want that?  Just kiddin,’ I’ll talk to them, you distract Rach.  Rachel, there you are! Come on, let’s serve that dessert already!  I like it.  What’s not to like? Custard? Good. Jam? Good. Meat? Gooooood.  No it isn’t, I ate that.  All right! Here we go! 1999! The year of Joey!  What\\'s the matter?!  All right, I\\'ll take care of it.  Ross! Ross! Ross, listen! Who are you kissing at midnight, huh? Rachel or Phoebe?  Well you gotta kiss someone, you can\\'t kiss your sister.  Chandler.  Dude-dude, who would you rather have kiss your sister, me or Chandler?  Yeah.  Okay, great!  Pheebs! Pheebs! Ross wants to kiss you at midnight!  Rach! Rach! Listen, I\\'m gonna kiss you at midnight.  So? Who would you rather have kiss you, me or Chandler?  Yeah!  So did that do anything for ya?  All right, my New Year\\'s resolution is to learn how to play the guitar.  Well, y\\'know those special skills I have listed on my resume? I would love it would be great if one of those was true.  Really? Who-who have you taught?  Yeah that\\'d be great! Thanks Pheebs!  Nice!! Yeah! Is that part of your resolution, your new thing for today?  You all right Chandler? Is there something funny about that name?  See ya! All right Pheebs, I am ready for my first lesson.  Umm, okay.  Yeah listen so, I thought I was getting better, so on my way home today I stopped by this guitar store and…  No.  Yes!  You look like a freak.  Yes! Yes, I did.  What?! I didn\\'t touch a guitar!  Your other student, was you!  Uhh, Chandler\\'s not here.  Okay.  Nice!  Oh. That is quite a situation. Uh, do you see any like, powder?  Good-good, okay, sprinkle some of that on your legs, it\\'ll absorb some of the moisture and then you can get your pants back up.  Umm, do you see any—oh, Vaseline?  Yeah, sure, spread some of that on there.  Ross? You okay?  Really?! Uhh, what color is it?  Well, I\\'m just—if the paste matches the pants, you can make yourself a pair of paste pants and she won\\'t know the difference!  Oh well, you\\'re timing couldn\\'t be better. I am putting out fires all over the place.  What-what is it, what is it?  Oh no, no-no-no-no! I don\\'t want to know!  I don\\'t care, Rach! Look, I am tired of being the guy who knows all the secrets but can\\'t tell anyone!  And you\\'re not supposed to be gossiping!!  I\\'m not listening to you!  Hey, Pheebs?  Howdy partner!  Umm?  Well, then it wouldn\\'t be a secret. So yeah, that would be okay. Yeah. Yeah!  Now? You want me to go over there now?  Do you know something?  I might know something.  What\\'s the thing you know?  I can\\'t tell you what I know.  Okay, fine.  You don\\'t know!  Yeah, I know!!!!  Oh, I am going to go for a walk in the rain.  I’m not telling, you’ll have to see it on TV!  No, couldn’t care less.  Hey you too!  What? You weren’t in it.  Oh sorry. Uh-uh, Kash?  This is my friend Rachel. Rachel, Kash, Kash, Rachel.  Hey!  Oh you know uh Kash, really liked you the other day. He said he thought you were charming.  Hey, I’m with you. He even asked me if I thought you’d go out with him.  I said no.  What? I…I just figured since you’re pregnant you’re not gonna be seeing people.  I didn’t tell him. I didn’t know if you were telling people. This is back when I thought Kash was still people.  Rach look, I really don’t think that’s such a great…  Hey!  No. No. But I’ll go see a normal person movie with ya.  It’s no Ukrainian film.  I set her up with this actor on my show.  No  Well, I was thinking that it’d probably be okay because Ross hasn’t gone out with Rachel in five years!  Are we talking about one of those big boats that carry cars that go like five miles an hour?  Hey Kash. Uh hey-hey this is Ross. Ross, this is Kash.  So what movie do you want to see—And not another one I have to read. Okay? I get enough of that from books.  All right, car magazines, cereal boxes, but it’s like enough!  And just wait for Rachel to come back from her date?  Dude! What is going on?!  Why?  They go on one date and you’re worried about them getting married?! He’s not you!  Well Ross, what did you think she was gonna do?  What do you mean?  That’s a nice picture. Maybe you can still have that!  Hey, can I ask you something? In this, in this picture of you and your wife, is your wife Rachel?  Good call. Yeah. But, the face Ross, the face isn’t Rachel.  I know, but I don’t think that’s what she wants.  That’s okay Ross maybe you need a new picture. Okay? It’s not gonna be what you thought, but no matter what there’s gonna be a brand new little baby, your baby. Who cares what the picture looks like?  Hey, I tell you what. Let’s you and me go out and have some fun. Huh? Whatever you want. Come on!  No, I said fun!  I can’t believe she would say that too you.  Well, I’ve just never seen a guy stare so hard at a piece of paper that didn’t have naked chicks on it.  Oh-ooh-ooh! Y’know what’s a good visual aide?  Why not?!  Hey! Any good mail?  Ooh, it’s probably a residual check, hey can you open it for me, I’m kinda….  Hmm that’s weird. I don’t remember being in a move called benefits lapsed.  Let me see that!  All right well, I guess I gotta go get a job. I’m gonna go see my agent.  What are you talkin’ about? I never left you! You’ve always been my agent!  Yeah!  Estelle, you gotta get me some work. I-I lost my health insurance.  Why?  Bastard!  What?!  Nothing! Well, I-I got this blinding pain in my stomach when I was lifting weights before, then I uh passed out and uh, haven’t been able to stand up since. But um, I don’t think it’s anything serious.  Dude! Hernia operations cost like, a lot probably. Besides it’s getting darker and more painful, that means it’s healing.  Thank you, but it would take me forever to pay you that money back and I don’t want that hanging over my head. Okay? Besides, as soon as my insurance kicks in I can get all the free operations I want! Yeah, I’m thinking I’ll probably start with that laser eye surgery too.  Hey!  Sure, now I’m scared.  Yeah, but I don’t wanna die!  Exactly.  Yes!  Yeah! And hey, thanks for coming with me. And thanks again for helping me take a shower.  Ah, just one thing umm, is it all right with you if I, if I scream right up until you say action?  Hey-hey-hey!  Cool.  Well, you might wanna make a little extra, y\\'know you’ll probably be hungry after the sex.  Hey.  Check the freezer. If there’s none in there, then we’re probably out. Are you just getting in from work? It’s late.  I discovered I’m able to count all of my teeth using just my tongue.  Oh, I was reading it last night, and I got scared, so.  Well, safer. Y\\'know, I mean I never start reading The Shining, without making sure we’ve got plenty of room in the freezer, y\\'know.  Haven’t you ever read the same book over and over again?  The question should be Rach, what is not so great about The Shining. Okay? And the answer would be: nothing. All right? This is like the scariest book ever. I bet it’s way better than that classic of yours.  All right, you got it.  Okay.  Ah, now Rach, these ah, these little women.  How little are they? I mean, are they like scary little?  These little women. Wow!  Oh yeah! Amy just burned Jo’s manuscript. I don’t see how he could ever forgive her.  No wonder Rachel had to read this so many times.  Hey Robert, could you ah, ha, pass me those cookies?  Hey, Rach, how you doing with The Shining?  Oooh, the next part’s the best, when that dead lady in the bathtub...  Oh, all blank, and no blank, make’s blank a blank blank. Oh no-no-no, no, the end when Jack almost kills them all with that blank, but then at last second they get away. Aww!  Hey! Mine was by accident! All right, the boiler explodes and destroys the hotel, and kills the dad.  Beth, Beth dies?  Is that true? If I keep reading is Beth gonna die?  Then why would you say that?!  Beth is really, really sick.  Jo’s there, but I don’t think there’s anything she could do.  Yeah.  I gotta get the before shot!  Ooh, something hurts!  Are they? I didn\\'t know I cared that much.  Oh my!  Not in my head.  Oh, a couple of nurses asked them out. Maybe they\\'re with them.  Yeah, I was bummed too.  Umm, well, what else could it be?  Or?  Well, maybe a little. I wish you hadn\\'t seen me throw up.  Ohh, get these things out of me!  Argh!  Argh!  Oh my God.  Look, I told ya, I’m not going to any clinic! I don’t have a problem, you’re the one with the problem! You should go to a \"Quit being a baby and leave me alone\" clinic!  Yeah, they do! Quit being a baby and leave me alone! There, you’ve just had your first class!  Ohhh, yeah!  I gotta do what I gotta do, you gotta do what you gotta do, you just do it.  That’s not whipped! Whipped is wh-tcssh!  You can’t do anything!  This sucks! I didn’t know I had to stay up all night before I went to this stupid sleep clinic! I’m so tired!  Yeah, well…  Yeah, Rach, I think you’re handling that really well.  Joey Tribbiani.  What?!  Hey everybody! Uh, I\\'d like you to meet Janine. She\\'s-she\\'s gonna be my new roommate!  Yeah, she\\'s gonna live with me!  I didn\\'t know that! Well, what a pretty last name!  You\\'re a dancer? She-she\\'s a dancer!  Of course I did.  \"When can you move in?\"  Ugh, I cannot wait to ask her out!  Oh God, yeah.  Oh, Oh, you\\'re right! I don\\'t want that. I can\\'t date her!  Well, that\\'s gonna be tough Mon. I mean it\\'s hard for me to be around an attractive woman and not flirt.  You a little sad about that sweetheart?  Boy, it was so hard not to laugh, I tell ya. Hey, hey, the place looks great!  No-no-no I\\'ve seen it happen, you-you get a rapport going with a woman but somehow you manage to kill it. What\\'s your secret?  This is great, this is great, what else, what else?  Uh, don\\'t you mean \"for whom?\"  Pizza, heh, its not like I never had that before...ba dum bum cheshhh.  All right, All right, let\\'s just get this out in the open okay? You\\'re hot. I\\'m lovable. Clearly there\\'s a vibe going on between us. But, we\\'re roommates and it\\'s a huge mistake for us to continue down this road.  No, no, no, I\\'m telling ya. Imagine yourself living in a supermarket and you will understand okay? So the question is, what do we do?  Oh!  Oh! I see what happened. It\\'s because I was trying to repel you. Right? Believe me, you\\'d feel a lot different if I turned it on.  What?!?!  Oh dear God!  Ross, did you really read all these baby books?  I love babies, with their little baby shoes, and their little baby toes, and their little baby hands...  Need a new table.  That\\'s the rule.  How\\'d you get to that?  You knew about that?  Ok, ok, How about if we split it?  Yeah  Why not?  Why, are you moving out?  You\\'d tell me if you were moving out right  Aw, I know all about Kip!  Well, let me ask you something, was Kip a better roommate than me?  Or an uncle...  Hey, Chandler, that table place closes at 7, come on.  Whoa, store will be open tomorrow!  Feminist issue. That\\'s where I went!  So what, like people are gonna come in and think, \"Uh-oh, I\\'m outside again?\" Of course!  I don\\'t know, birds just don\\'t say, \"Hello, sit here, eat something.\"  All right, how about the ladybugs?  Fine, you want to get the birds, get the birds!  Who cares, we\\'ll eat at the sink! Come on, let\\'s play!  No-no, she kicked our butts. You could be on the Olympic standing-there team.  Yes, now is when you swoop! You gotta make sure that when Paolo walks out of there, the first guy Rachel sees is you, She\\'s gotta know that you\\'re everything he\\'s not! You\\'re like, like the anti-Paolo!  Wha-  Hey!  Uh, it\\'s 2:30 in the morning!  Oh yeah!  Oh my God! You’re pregnant!  God, it’s gonna so weird like when I come home and you’re not here. Y’know? No more Joey and Chan’s. No more J and C’s. \"You wanna go over to Joey and Chandler’s?\" \"Can’t, its not there.\"  Yeah but we won’t be able to like get up in the middle of the night and have those long talks about our feelings and the future.  Hi.  Hey! I did not cry my eyes out!! Come on! It’s like the end of an era! No more J-man and Channie’s!!  So, Ross and Rachel got married, Monica and Chandler almost got married, do you think you and I should hook up?  Really?! Well, when?  Wow.  Great!  Oh-oh, what about Ross?  Hey!  What, what!? it\\'s for her hot friends!  And starting to think about settling down!  I\\'d love to! Yeah!  Oh, yeah! How was I supposed to know?  Hey Mr. and Mrs. Geller! Let me help you with that.  Oh man, this is great, uh? The three of us together again! You know what would be fun? If we gave this present to Emma from all of us!  Hey Pheebs, you know what? I was thinking... since you wrote a song, maybe I could do something for Emma using my talents!  No, no, no! My talents as an actor!  You know, I could like maybe... I could do a dramatic reading of one of her books!  Hey, I think Emma might like it!  Um, my present!  Actually we prepared performances.  But equally real!  Hey, I do it every week with three cameras pointed at me and a whole crew waiting!  I will be doing a dramatic reading of one of Emma’s books.  I\\'m so confused!  Well, that one did not have Emma\\'s face on it.  No.  Nighty-night!  Bye, bye.  Hey, hey, hey, hey! I\\'m not gonna mess with Jack, he\\'s a great man, he fought for our country.  Oh! I forgot you used to live here!  Hello?  What? You never said anything about an audition!  Oh! I got it! Ok, everyone pick a number from one to ten. Alright? Whoever gets the highest number gets to go first.  Okay, Monica picks ten, I call nine! Anyone else?  Or.. we could flip a coin, and then multiply the..  Right.  Come on robot!  Way to go robot!  Hey, good race you guys.  Okay, if Ross and Rachel ask, I\\'ve been here the whole time. THE WHOLE TIME!  What is wrong with me. It looked more delicious when it was a penis.  Yeah. We figured when we couldn’t find you, you’d gone home to make up with Rachel. Which is probably what you shoulda done. Huh?  Look, Ross look, I’m on board about this totally honesty thing, I am, just not about stuff that’s gonna get you in trouble.  Yeah, and there won’t be a relationship left to rebuild.  Yeah, I-I think that women just have a lower threshold of pain than men, that’s all. I mean, come on, it’s just a little wax.  Okay, fine, so now what, I just pull it off?  Don’t answer that.  Awful! Horrible!  She was nothing compared to you.  Ewwwww!  Yeah, we’ll be fine.  You think I need a new walk?  Well y\\'know, I’ve been walking the same way since high school. Y\\'know, y\\'know how some guys they walk into a room and everybody takes notice. I think I need a ‘take notice’ walk.  Maybe she killed him?  Yeah, but then the guy opens his beer and those girls run at him, so, everything seems to work out OK.  Hey, hey, check it out, guess what I got.  No, my first fan mail.  Oh my god, I got my very own stalker.  Hey, whaddya wanna do for dinner?  Ah, the stalker.  Let\\'s get out of here.  OK, we\\'ll just leave, and when we pass her on the stairs, she won\\'t know it\\'s me \\'cause we\\'ve never met.  She\\'s comin\\'.  Uhh, this is it, this is how we\\'re gonna die. Ready?  Erica.  Yeah it is. . . what?  Yeah, that was a tricky one. In reality, that operation takes like, over 10 hours, but they only showed it for 2 minites.  No one.  Uhh, cause, uhh, I\\'m a neurosurgeon and that was clearly a case of, uh, uh, foodal chokage. Alright, look, I got to tell you something.  But that\\'s what...  Oh my God, quick turn off the TV.  Uh, I get Leslie out of the coma and then we make out.  Hey Erica, c\\'mon in.  Right, they uh, they choppered me in. What\\'s up?  Who?  It\\'s not what you think, that was...  Alright look, that\\'s it. I don\\'t think we should see each other anymore, alright. Look, I know I should have told you this a long time ago but I am not Drake Remore, OK. I\\'m not even a doctor, I\\'m an actor. I just pretend to be a doctor.  Somebody wanna help me out here?  \\'Cause it\\'s a television show.  I\\'m not Drake.  Yes, I\\'m afraid it is. You deserve much better than me Erica. You deserve to be with the real Drake, he\\'s the one you fell in love with. Go to Salem, find him, he\\'s the guy for you.  Right. Goodbye Erica, good luck in Salem. Take care  OK, alright, the people who threw the water.  This is amazing.  I finally get a part on TV and the monkey\\'s makin\\' movies.  Woah, dude, burn.  Uh, excuse me. Jerry is the director, which one\\'s he?  Gotcha. Phoebs, walk with me.  Well, we\\'re, we\\'re just goin\\' over here so that we can get away from the horrible flesh eating virus, for the love of God woman, listen to me. Is he lookin\\', is he lookin\\'?  Oh man, she\\'s so smokin, she has got the greatest set of. . . no guys around, huh.  You\\'re blowin\\' me off for a monkey?  Yeah, unless you hook up with a bunch of pigeons.  Oooh.  Yaaahhh. Ahhh, candles. What\\'dya thinks gonna happen here tonight?  Forget about it.  So, assistant to the director. That\\'s a really exciting job, I mean, you must have a ton of cool responsibilities.  So what\\'re you guys gonna eat?  Ma?  Chandler? What\\'re you still doin\\' here, I though you guys took off.  Are you naked in there?  Huh, you uh, you always wear panties?  Wow, talk about your bad luck, I mean, the first time you try panties and someone walks off with your clothes.  Well, let me see.  Chandler\\'s wearing panties.  Can\\'t help you, I\\'m not wearing any.  Oh, I\\'m gettin\\' heat from the guy in the hot pink thong.  Hey, hey, and I\\'m in the movie.  One of the virus victims called in sick, so Cathy recommended me and boom, I\\'m dying on the gurney. Oh Ross, Marcel just finished his last scene if you want to go down there and say goodbye.  Aaaaagggghhhhh.  Aaaaagggghhhhh.  Aaaaagggghhhhh. Mommy  Yeah, in my third drawer on my dresser. You don’t want to lose that.  Woo-hoo!!  London baby!  Bye, Pheebs!  Come on! Do something!  Really? To what?  Hey!  Oh, I embarrass you?  Thanks.  Hey.  Me too.  Noo!! I’ve had the best day ever! Dude, check this out!  That’s Fergie baby!!  That just cost me four bucks. But uh listen, I just called to see how the chick and the duck are doing?  Kinda, but I’ve just been having way too much fun.  No, I don’t think so.  Who’s seven?  Ahh, the babies miss me?  What? You ordered pizza without me?!  Two pizzas?!  Wait, well, where did you get it from?!  What’s in it?  Hello?  Hey. I spent the night out. I met this cute bridesmaid. She is so...  Ahh Pheebs, you know you’re still my number one girl.  Ohh great!!!  Okay.  Right!  Hey.  Have you seen Monica?  Look we’ve got to find her. Phoebe just called!! Rachel’s coming to tell Ross she loves him!!  I know! That’s why we got to find Monica!! You know where she is?  Hey, Felicity.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  No, but it’s okay. She just came in and gave him a hug, that it.  No.  How long do you have to go for?  A year?!  Wait a minute, you can\\'t go to Tulsa. Maybe you forgot, but we\\'ve got tickets to the Jets game next week.  We were gonna go see the Jets!  I can\\'t believe you guys are moving.  Uhuh.  Actually, you know what? I am. That whole thing with Rachel made me realize that maybe I\\'m ready for a more serious relationship. You know? Like I\\'d like to meet a nice mature commitment-minded lady. And looks aren\\'t as important as...Nah, she\\'s gotta be hot.  I can do that, yeah. How is Friday?  Yeah!  Hey!  Yeah, so you found someone for me. You didn\\'t forget?  No.  Mike.  Damnit! Is there no mystery left in romance anymore!?  MIKE!!!  Everything is gonna be fine. Just follow my lead, okay? All you have to do is pretend to be Mike.  Atta boy!  Okay, look...  Mike, \\'attorney at law\\'!  What? That\\'s the kinda thing you usually run by me.  Which is why I waited until now to introduce you to Mike.  No, no, that\\'s not what I meant. Let\\'s get you a cocktail.  Yeah, that\\'s because we had a bit of a falling out. Mike hit my mom with a car.  That\\'s okay Mike, I have forgiven you. And now we\\'re friends again everything\\'s great!  What?!  Because I forgot about our date, I\\'m so sorry.  Good night!  Look at this. My two best friends!  I\\'m mad at you for leaving! You\\'re nothing but a big leaver. Big leaver with a stupid suitcase.  He had to board.  Why’re you so tired?  You know what you should’ve done, you should have told yourself that little story.  Hey so where’s Ross?  Is he still mad at us?  That’s not fair! I can’t do that.   Fine, fine okay.  But I gotta say technically, I didn’t even do anything wrong.  I said I didn’t technically.  No, look, I don’t know what else to do. I said I’m sorry!  You should scream at me, or-or-or curse me, or hit me.  Why not?  You’ll feel better!  I’ll feel better, and you know you want to. I can see it in your eyes.  A little bit.  Little bit.  No, hit me  Hit me.  Hit me!  I’m sorry! It was a reflex!  You were supposed to duck!!! Why didn’t you duck?  Hey, so how is it?  You, you want me to help you with that?  It’s pretty, Okay date of birth?  Sure, May...tember.  Occupation? Dinosaurs.  Alright, who do you want as your emergency contact?  Okay, relationship, boy this could take a while.  Come on, you guys are more then that! I mean, you’re gonna get together right?  But you two were supposed to be together.  Come on, Ross, that didn’t mean anything! She just had the baby, she was all freaked out about doing it alone, she would have said yes to anybody.  So?  Wow.  Really?  And you’re Okay with that?  You know, ah, I’ve been thinking about this and I gotta tell ya, it’s not my fault. It’s a natural instinct.  Oh, it was a lot of fun right up until Chandler got a finger in the eye!  Rachel... let\\'s be clear on this, ok? I do not love Hugsy. I like him a normal amount...  Why wouldn\\'t she? He\\'s a wonderful person!  It\\'s okay, it\\'s okay Rach, it\\'s me. Put down the scrunchy.  Well, I heard Emma stirring, so I came to make sure she could reach Hugsy.  Hey, look who\\'s here! It\\'s Joey, and he brought home a friend.  No, no, it\\'s not a girl, it\\'s... a brand new Hugsy!  No, no, Emma has one Hugsy, the new Hugsy, huh? The other Hugsy, I don\\'t know, I guess I\\'ll just take it back.  Oh, no don\\'t worry about that, I swallowed that years ago.  But he\\'s the same.  But he\\'s the same.  He\\'s the same!  Original or crappy?  No, sorry haven\\'t seen him.  It\\'s Monica, ok?  Alright!! Fine! It\\'s original Hugsy! No, now I know that Emma wants him but he\\'s mine and I need him..  ... she\\'s being unreasonable!  It does?  Really? She... she loves me?  Ok, wait wait wait wait a minute wait a minute, I mean Rach, I mean if if... . If Hugsy means that much to Emma then... well she can have him.  Look forget it forget it... I can\\'t do it.  How do you think I got him in the first place?  Hey, Chan, can you help me out here? I promise I\\'ll pay you back.  I will, really. I\\'ll pay you back this time.  Well... I\\'m helping out down at the N.Y.U. Med School with some... research.  Oh, just, y\\'know.... science.  Alright, come on you guys, it\\'s not that big a deal. Really... I mean, I just go down there every other day and... make my contribution to the project. Hey, hey, but at the end of two weeks, I get seven hundred dollars.  We make fire. Cook meat.  Oh, OK.  I don\\'t know, she\\'s, uh.... she\\'s pretty great.  What, you think I\\'m gonna tell a girl I like that I\\'m also seeing a cup?  Well, the tough thing is, she really wants to have sex with me.  Yeah, well, I still got a week left to go in the program, and according to the rules, if I want to get the money I\\'m not allowed to conduct any... ersonal experiments, if you know what I mean.  Hey!  The country?  Oh no! How can she do that when she\\'s never shown any interest in you?!?  He\\'s right, man. Please. Move on. Go to China. Eat Chinese food.  Listen, buddy, we\\'re just looking out for you.  Like the three musketeers, only with fruit.  Well, not so good. She definitely thinks tonight is the night we\\'re gonna... complete the transaction, if you know what I...  Then you do. Heh, heh.  What do you mean?  Not following you.  Well, given that he\\'s desperately in love with you, he probably wouldn\\'t mind getting a cup of coffee or something.  The country.  He\\'s right, cause if you\\'re just gonna, like, break his heart, that\\'s the kind of thing that can wait.  Heh, heh. It was nothin\\'.  Sure! Why not?  How do you mean?  Shhhh!  She\\'s still asleep.  Oh, it was amazing. You know how you always think you\\'re great in bed?  Well, it\\'s like, last night, I couldn\\'t do the thing that usually makes me great. So I had to do all this other stuff. And the response I got... man, oh man, it was like a ticker tape parade!  It was amazing! And not just for her... uh-uh. For me, too. It\\'s like, all of a sudden, I\\'m blind. But all my other senses are heightened, y\\'know? It\\'s like... I was able to appreciate it on another level.  I know! Neither did I!  Seven hundred bucks!  Man, hell of a two weeks, huh? Y\\'know what, though? I really feel like I learned something.  Hey!  Whoa-whoa-whoa! Before you start handing out wedding rings and planning bachelor parties, don’t you have to decide who your best man is gonna be?  What?! He got to do it at your first wedding!  Come on Ross! Look, I-I don’t have any brothers; I’ll never get to be a best man!  I can’t believe you’re not picking me.  Do you guys have like a big bowl I can borrow?  Oh, it’s Ross’s bachelor party.  Are you bachelors?  Are you strippers?  Oh-whoa, what party?  This is what I’ve got going for the party so far, liquor wise. Get a lot of liquor.  Okay, now uh, in terms of the invite list, I’ve got you, me, and Chandler and I’m gonna invite Gunther ‘cause, well, we’ve been talking about this pretty loud.  All right—oh! Listen, I know this is your party, but I’d really like to the number of museum geeks that are gonna be there.  Okay! We’ll need a six-pack of Zima.  You got it.  Well, there’s gonna be strippers there. He didn’t say anything about no strippers.  Oh, I chose not to hear that.  Yeah?  Oh, hey, don’t forget your shirt.  Yeah!  Oh thanks. Thanks. It was great meetin’ ya. And listen if any of my friends gets married, or have a birthday, or a Tuesday…  Oh unless you uh, you wanna hang around.  Yeah. I’ll let you play with my duck.  The ring is gone!  Dude, this isn’t funny! What am I gonna do?! I go to bed last night, everything’s cool! I wake up this morning, the stripper’s gone and the ring is gone!  Ugh! I don’t know what I’m going to do! I called the company that sent and th-they don’t care! Then I called 9-1-1 and they laughed at me, if this isn’t an emergency, then what is?  Hey…  So uh, hey, that uh, that wedding ring, huh? Man, that’s nice!  I was uh, I was thinking I might want to pick one of those babies up for myself, I might want to get one of those…  Dude, I screwed up, you don’t have to turn me in!  Oh, yeah, well I already did that! They said they’re gonna look into it right after they solved all the murders.  I did that too! They wouldn’t give me her real name or her number. They said, \"If I bothered them again they’d call the police.\" I said, \"If you talk to the police, you tell them I’m missing a ring!\"  Look Ross, I am so-so sorry. I-I-I…  Oh, that sounds like fun, but we’ve got a ring to find!!  There was a ring, in a box, on my nightstand, after you left, it was gone!  If anything should happen to him…  So! Things can go wrong! You don’t know! What if he doesn’t make it?!  Yeah, but what if he doesn’t? He’s such a good duck.  I’m so worried about him, y’know?  H-h-h-how’s the duck?  Ohh, great! Oh hey, listen Ross, thanks for being so cool about this.  No, it’s not. I mean you-you made me your best man and I totally let you down!  Now, don’t argue with me…  Really?  I call it!!  Does calling it not mean anything anymore?!  So, did you uh, find anyone to marry you guys yet?  Well then let me do it!  No-no-no! Look, I’ve been thinking about it. I’m an actor right? So I won’t get nervous talking in front of people.  No-no-no-no look no! I won’t spit, and I won’t stare at Monica’s breasts! Y’know? Everyone knows I’m an ass man!  Yeah and the most important thing is that it won’t be some like, stranger up there who barely knows you. It’ll be me! And I swear I’ll do a really good job. Plus, y’know I love you guys and-and it would really mean a lot to me.  So I can do it?  All right!!! Okay!! All right! Okay-okay, I gotta get started on my speech! Oh, wait a minute, Internet ministers can still have sex right?  Okay.  Yeah, I just got off the Internet! Man, there is a lot of porn out there!  Anyway, I started working on what I’m going to say for the ceremony, do you wanna hear it?  Okay you guys, I got a little more written. Are you ready?  Yes!  Ooh, like the time you and I went to Atlantic City and I made you laugh so hard you threw up your whole steak?! Remember?  Oh. Okay. Ooh! Ooh! Okay, maybe I’ll talk about London! Y’know when you two hooked up! Only, only I won’t say hooked up. I’ll say, \"Began their beautiful journey…\"  \"…by doin’ it.\"  Okay. All right. Umm, so uh, so how did it happen? Did your eyes meet across the room? And then the next thing y’know you’re in the bathtub together and she’s feeding you strawberries?  Yeah!! I call that London style.  Oh.  Yeah baby!  Oh.  Yeah baby!  Hey!  Oh, dude I’m so sorry!  Hey no-no-no-no! It’s cool! It’s cool! I-I’ll only be a second, I’m still with my bride’s maid, I just—Where are those condoms you brought?  Hey listen, why don’t you come downstairs with me? There’s some really nice girls down there.  That’s what that was?! ‘Cause that other thing? I thought you were on to something, but it did nothing for me.  This is crazy.  Hey.  Chandler, come on nothing even happened!  No-hey-no! If you don’t want me to do it, I except that. I don’t care about that. I just…I don’t want you to be upset.  Yeah for like a half an hour one night! Chandler, she wants you for the rest of her life! You’re so lucky! Look what I missed out on by not being there! Although you know what? It could never have worked like you guys did, ‘cause you guys are perfect for each other. Y’know, we look at you and-and we see you together and it just…it-it fits. Y’know? And you just know it’s gonna last forever.  What?  Really? I can do it?  Well I don’t know remember exactly but, it’s-it’s pretty much about having and giving and sharing and receiving.  Hey!  So are guys doing okay?  Here you go.  Good for you!  I know, I know, but look at the knobs on her.  Why?  Hey, you can stay with us! We\\'ll take care of ya!  Yeah.  Okay.  Ross?  Not a problem. And listen, hey! Since you\\'re gonna be here for a while, why don\\'t—I was thinking we uh, put your name on the answering machine.  Hey, all right!  Hey.  Nothing.  Dude, you should\\'ve gone out once and a while.  Come on, Chandler, Ross is our friend. He needs us right now, so why don\\'t you be a grown up and come and watch some TV in the fort!  Sorry.  Ahhhhhhhhhh…  Hey! Wanna play some foosball? Please?  No-no, no! We have to move the table into my room, yeah! \\'Cause of all the boxes. Come on!  No, the quiet down thing!  Um-hmm! Look, I-I-I don\\'t know how much more of this I can take! Did you know he taped over my Baywatch tape with some show about bugs! My God! What if that had been porn?  All right, I guess I can hold out a little longer. Let\\'s have a game.  YES!!  Um-hmm.  You guys got anything to eat? I just went down to Johnos for some chicken and it was closed!  Pheebs, if this guy keeps closing down all of our favorite places, where are we gonna eat?!  Umm, yum!  But it\\'s available now! Isn\\'t it?  Okay!  Yeah!  Somebody was using his head. Hey, let\\'s check out the rest of the place.  But hey, Ross, this place is available now!  Yeah.  Oh, it\\'s perfect!  Maybe, maybe we did a good thing, helping Ross get back on his feet!  Yeah!  Yeah!  I don\\'t know. Maybe pizza?  Oh! Oh!  Hey!  You\\'re kidding!  But you can\\'t stay with Phoebe, Ross! We\\'re-we\\'re roomies!  Definitely!  All right!  Dude, stop talking crazy and make us some tea!  I’m sorry, do I know you?  Nothing, I’m just practicing blowing you off because I’m gonna be a big movie star!  Well, no not yet. But the audition went really good.  Oh, it’s this big budget period movie about these three Italian brothers who come to America around the turn of the century. It’s really classy! Oh, and the director is supposed to be the next, next Martin Scorcese.  They want me to be totally naked in the movie!  I know! My grandmother’s gonna see this!  I don’t know! It’s not like it’s porn! This is a serious, legitimate movie. Y’know? And the nudity is really important to the story.  You’re right. Maybe I shouldn’t even go on the call back.  Well that’s true. And I am only naked in one scene. Plus it sounds really great. My character’s catholic and he falls in love with this Jewish girl. Who run away together and they get caught in this big rainstorm. So we go into this barn and undress each other and hold each other. It’s really sweet and-and tender.  Hey, I’m back!  Uh so, will-will I be reading the same scene again?  And scene! Huh? Wasn’t that fun? We did a little improv there. Yeah! Okay! So you-you-you-you were saying?  Wow! Sure! That’s great!  Yeah! Yeah sure, just long as it’s handled tastefully and that barn is not too cold.  So…What?  Yes!  No. What?  Barmifsaed?  Nope.  Yep.  That’s right.  I don’t know! I really want this part! And they tell you no matter what you get asked at an audition you say yes. Like if-if they want you to ride a horse, you tell ‘em you can! And just figure out how to do it later.  I kn-I know! I know! Okay? And apparently tomorrow when I go in to meet the director I have to take off my clothes so that they can see what my body looks like.  Unless what?  Like what?  Wow! This looks great!  And-and-and-and-and the toothpicks?  Thank God!  Ah.  Thanks, you are such a good friend. And this is so weird.  Ow!  Yeah.  The fruit roll up.  Delicious.  Wait a minute! Wait a minute! We have a winner!  The Silly Putty! It’s not so silly anymore!  And what’s cool is, the character is from Naples, right?  My whole family’s from Naples!  Oh, it’s a poster for that World War I movie that I’m in, check it out.  Uh-huh! I know. I’m coming soon to a theater near you! I’m in THX! I’m unsuitable for children!  Yeah, yeah, it’s already generating Oscar buzz.  Sure! Why not?!  Hello?  One guest? You told me I can have six tickets!  Oh my God. So that’s it?! I only get to bring one guest?  You said you didn’t want to go.  Definitely not invisible.  Well uh…I think I want to take Chandler.  Yeah! Yeah! I mean I’m sorry, I wish I can take everybody, but y’know Chandler always supported my career. He’s paid for acting classes and head shots and stuff and well this will be my way of paying you back.  It’s not just the stuff he paid for, I mean it’s-it’s everything. Y’know? He read lines with me. He-he went with me on auditions when I was really nervous, and then he consoled me after I didn’t get parts that I really wanted. You always believed in me man. Even, even when I didn’t believe in myself.  Thanks. That means a lot to me.  A little tall.  You liked it? You really liked it?  Which part exactly?  Oh no-no-no, give me some specifics.  Hey, what about the scene with the kangaroo? Did-did you like that part?  Hey! Sleeping beauty!  Uh-huh look, the only reason I can over here was to settle things between us! Okay? You’ve done a lot for me and my career, I wanted to pay you back so I took you to the premiere but you missed it! Okay, so how much do I owe you?  Give me a number, I don’t want to owe you anything!  Ah-ah-ah! We’re doing this! Okay, now you got me my first set of head shots. Right, how much were those?  Okay, five hundred dollars. What else?  Please!  All right, what else?  Which we’re still keeping under our hats!  Yeah. Okay, what else? Rent!  Okay. Okay, so I’m writing you a check for…So you fell asleep during my movie. Big deal right? How do you clear this thing?  I can\\'t believe you said woowoo. I don\\'t even say woowoo.  C\\'mon, she\\'s your mom!  Uhhhh.... I\\'ll just pee in the street.  Yeah.  Right. No big deal.  In Bizarro World!! You broke the code!  You don\\'t kiss your friend\\'s mom! Sisters are okay, maybe a hot-lookin\\' aunt... but not a mom, never a mom!  Yeah, well, you don\\'t have your racket.  Yeah, well you didn\\'t call and leave your grip size.  Ross, how could you let this happen?  You don\\'t think my mom\\'s sexy?  I\\'ll have you know that Gloria Tribbiani was a handsome woman in her day, alright? You think it\\'s easy giving birth to seven children?  He forgot to leave his grip size!  So are you gonna tell him?  How about \\'cause if you don\\'t, his mother might.  Uhhhh.... he\\'s not even wearing a jockstrap!  Uh... y\\'know, knowledge is a tricky thing.  Hey, hey, hey, you\\'re lucky I caught them when I did, or else who knows what woulda happened.  Me neither, y\\'know what-  What are you mad at me for?!  C\\'mon! Just try to picture her not pregnant, that\\'s all.  Shh. He did it. He told her off, and not just about the kiss, about everything.  No, no. He said \"When are you gonna grow up and start being a mom?\"  Then she came back with \"The question is, when are you gonna grow up and realise I have a bomb?\"  That makes more sense.  Hard to tell, they\\'re so tiny and upside-down. Wait, wait. They\\'re walking away... they\\'re walking away... No, no they\\'re not, they\\'re coming right at us! Run! Run!  You usually find them on the \\'heaving beasts\\'.  Then why are you wearing Monica’s jacket?  Come here, check this out!  What?! All right—Hey! Don’t look at me! You’re the one who wanted to come up and look for some stupid Burger King comet!  Come on!  All right well, y’know…I guess we know what we have to do to get down.  All right, it won’t go down any further. It’s stuck.  Oh whoa-whoa wait a minute! I have to do it?!  What if I smack my head on the concrete?  No.  What? No! No Ross! No-no! Stop! I’m not jumping! Okay, look I have an audition tomorrow and I can’t go if I break my leg.  Well all right so, it looks like we’re even!  Man, I’m starving! What the hell was I thinking at dinner?! \"Do you want soup or salad?\" Both! Always order both!  Yeah? Really? No one’s home?  Yeah!  All right! Just hurry up!  I think face to face.  Face to face, yeah!  All right.  Y’know, when we talked about face to face, I don’t think we thought it all the way through.  Well, just shimmy down me and drop!  Hi.  It’s not that far! Just drop!  Ross, you should know that my pants are startin’ to come down and I’m not wearing any underwear!  Hey you guys.  I like her so much!  I know. And she’s so sweet. I just wanna feed her grapes and brush her hair.  Totally! I would love to spend New Year’s with you.  Did she just ask me out on a date?  Oh. Maybe. But hey I know how I can find out. We’re going to a New Year’s Eve party, right? So at midnight, I can kiss her. And if she kisses me back, great! Y’know? But if she says ‘Dude, what the hell are you doing?’ I can say ‘It wasn’t me, it was New Years!’  OK, listen I’ve been on sets before, so let me give you a little advice, alright? It’s a show, but we’re just dancing, OK? It’s no big deal. The important thing to remember – stay cool.  Ross! So when is it gonna air?  Really?  What do you mean?  Uh-huh.  No-no-no-no-no we came together!  No-no hey buddy, please let me dance with that girl, I really like her and I think I have a shot.  Hey! Tall guy! Hey, listen, I wanted to talk to you about that girl that you’re dancing with.  Yeah, yeah, okay. Uh, look buddy, I came with that girl, and I had this plan to kiss her at the new years countdown – I’m trying to win her over, so I was wondering if..  Oh come on man, you can dance with my partner, she’s real, uh, mellow!  Well, I was hoping after tonight that maybe I could you know…  Uh, take a look at the guy’s pants! I mean, I know you told us to show excitement, but don’t you think he went a little overboard?  Yeah, take a hike wetpants!  No! Year! Happy No Year!  Home sweet home, huh? Nice to, uh, get back to reality. Plus we know how the New Year’s gonna go off. I guess there’s no reason for all that Y2K panic, y’know? Anyway, g’night!  Yeah?  Oh, yoii. What was that for?  Really? In the moment, I really wanted to kiss you too. In the moment.  But only in the moment. So do ya wanna kiss again?  No.  3, 2,  Uh, yeah, okay. Except I sorta felt like I needed a couple of seconds to get ready.  Hey!  What are you guys doing up?  Aww, you guys are so cute!  All right, I\\'ll see you in the morning.  Well uh, it\\'s just that uh, y\\'know if-if you\\'re gonna be wearing someone\\'s sweatshirt shouldn\\'t it be your boyfriends--and I’m not him.  No-no! No! I mean it\\'s gonna be all smelling like Monica!  Yeah, I didn’t know you guys were going to be here.  Nothing!  Well, it involved Monica.  Don\\'t worry, there wasn\\'t any sex in it or anything. I haven\\'t dreamt about her like that since I found out about you two--ish.  Well, okay. You were my girlfriend and we were doing the crossword puzzle. Y\\'know like you guys were doing last night. So, that\\'s it. I\\'m in love with Monica and I\\'ll be moving out.  It-it doesn’t?  That kinda sounds like your dream dude.  In the dream I did enjoy the closeness.  No, I don\\'t think it\\'s just about just getting a girlfriend. Y\\'know? I mean, yeah, I can get a girlfriend! Yeah, we could sit in the chair and do crosswords, but y\\'know are we ever going to have y\\'know the closeness like-like you guys have?  Friends first? That\\'s interesting.  No, never done that either.  Uh, hey, Rach let me ask you something. Uh, I was just over there talking to Monica and Chandler, boy they are really tight.  Yeah that\\'s not such a bad situation they got going over there. I\\'m thinking of getting me one of those.  Well, the reason I think Monica and Chandler are so great…  …is because they were friends first. Y\\'know? So I asked myself, \"Who are my friends?\" You and Phoebe, and I saw you first. So…  I\\'m saying maybe you and I crank it up a notch.  Won\\'t-won\\'t that take longer?  Uhh, well, she\\'s…really good in bed.  Closeness-shmoshness! There was three of us for crying out loud!  Uhh, just a minute officer!!  No.  Yeah.  Oh, we’re supposed to just get him a ticket?! That guy is always mooching off of us!  Oh wow that’s a great idea! And I still have his credit card.  All the time!  Oh hey listen I got us tickets to a Knicks game tonight.  Come on! It’ll be fun! Me, you, and Ross, and… Paul probably…  No! He blew us off!  I know!  Can I tell you something? Me too.  Ooooh! Freeze him out.  I like it!  Oh my God!!  And-and-and-and-and-and, and we’re gonna be friends again!  Oh it’s water under the bridge, forget it!  I think I’m gonna cry!  Tongue?  Cool.  You got all that from saline solution?  Hey, Julie, I didn\\'t know you wore lenses.  Ross, listen. I got two words for you. Threesome.  Ok, let\\'s start with the cons, \\'cause they\\'re more fun. All right, Rachel first.  You could say that.  Oh, her ankles are a little chubby.  He broke up with Julie. Well, go hug her, for god\\'s sakes.  Hey, uh, why don\\'t you read it to her?  Hey, cut him some slack. It was Chandler\\'s idea.  Oh, yeah, I do.  I can’t tell you that, no.  Man, I remember the first time I saw that girl Katherine, after we broke up. She was just walking with her friend Donna, just laughing and talking. God, it killed me.  Sorry, I just, any excuse to tell that story y\\'know....  I don’t know, Chandler is supposed to be passin’ ‘em around...  Chandler!  Oh my God! How many of these things did you have? These are pure vodka.  No, only for sex.  Hey!! Hey-hey-hey!  I just got off the phone with my sister.  Mary-Angela.  Yeah.  Why don’t you ask Chandler, ‘cause he’s the one that fooled around with her. She told me you said you could really fall for her. Now is that true? Or are you just gettin’ over Janice by groping my sister.  Really? That’s great! You and my sister, sittin’ in a tree.  Waiting for my Grandma to finish my laundry. What about you?  What’s goin’ on?  What?! How could you do that, how could you think she was Mary-Angela?  Well, that is usually what I would do. But I just never thought you’d be on the receiving end of it. How could you do this?!  No! No! No! No, I’m not going to punch Chandler.  All right.  Cookie, now you can punch him!  Guggly worm.  Glow-pop giggly jammer.  Look, there’s nothing I can do for him right now, he’s still in his sweat pants, that’s still Phase One. Y\\'know? I’ll be back for Phase Two, I would never miss Phase Two.  Gettin’ drunk and going to a strip club.  Which helps him get to Phase Three, picturing yourself with other women.  Yeah.  Oh my God, you guys have no idea.  Yeah, three days on the lake without a shower. Plus! I fell in that big tub of worms at the bait stand! Hey, how-how’s he doing?  Look, I know I feel asleep before I could shower and now I don’t have time! They’re just ten blocks away, if I run, I can make it.  Look at that, Charlton Heston eating a liquorice whip!  Y’know, I can see why you think that, but ah, actually, you know who I think it is?  No-no, it’s uh, it’s Heston.  Yeah, the man wreaks! Smells like he went on a three day fishing trip and then ate some liquorice.  Really, a shower huh? And uh, which-which room might that be?  Interesting.  How ya doin’?  I guess you wouldn’t believe me if I said I was Kurt Douglas, huh?  No-no-no, no, no, wait. You see, I’m an actor, Joey Tribbiani, I’m doing a scene with you today, and well, I stink.  Yeah-yeah, I’m one of the cops that won’t work with you ‘cause you a lose cannon. Anyway, look, I’m really sorry, but I stink!  Yeah.  Oh no-no-no, you don’t understand…  Oh yeah, yeah.  Yeah. Oh, yeah.  I don’t wanna.  I wanted to go to the strip club!  I need something sweet.  Ooh-ooh, I! I am thankful for this beautiful fall we\\'ve been having.  I mean, it\\'s not so much an underpant as it is a feat of engineering. I mean, it\\'s amazing how much they can do with so little material! And the way they play with your mind! Is it there? Is it not there?  Oh, come on! I wanna hear it! It wouldn\\'t be Thanksgiving without Chandler bumming us out!  Man, it must be so cool remembering stuff like that! I don\\'t have any past life memories.  Hey, it\\'s not like it sounds.  Phoebe?  I know! It\\'s stuck!!!  I put it on to scare Chandler!  Well then help me get it off! Plus, it smells really bad in here.  It\\'s Joey.  I can\\'t! It-it\\'s stuck!  Sorry! Sorry.  Hey, I wasn\\'t the only one who looked like an idiot. All right? Remember when Ross tried to say, \"Butternut squash?\" And it came out, \"Squatternut buash?\"  You\\'re a dork.  Hey!  It\\'s my house-warming present for Monica and Chandler.  Uh-huh. And I named them Chick Jr. and Duck Jr.  Yeah, I figure they\\'ll love it at the new house, you know? It has that big backyard. And then, when they get old, they can go to that special farm that Chandler took the other chick and duck to.  Yeah. It\\'s a shame people can\\'t visit there.  Yeah, Erica went into labor last night. Monica and Chandler are at the hospital right now!  Uh, I think she\\'s still asleep. Hey, hey, how did it go with you guys last night? She seemed pretty pissed at you.  Oh my God. You and Rachel?  So what does that mean? Are you guys getting back together?  So, so is she still going to Paris?  Okay.  I bet you did!  Sure, yeah. Will you just keep an eye on the chick and the duck?  Oh my God! What did you say?  You can\\'t just give up! Is that what a dinosaur would do?  Dude, I\\'m just trying to speak your language.  Hey!  Oh, you\\'re not taking her with you tonight?  Ross, wait!  Could you get me a muffin?  Hey, you know what might help?  It\\'s a... It\\'s a \"welcome home\" sign for the baby.  No, I sat in the paint.  Why not?  Yeah, I know what you mean. I mean, sometimes...  Damn it!  You know, the baby can\\'t read, Mike!  Monica just called from the cab. She said they should be here any minute. And apparently, there\\'s some big surprise.  Oh, they\\'re so cute! Now, what, what kinds are they?  Hey, that pregnant girl\\'s name was Erica.  Hey, maybe that\\'s for the best.  Yeah. You know? You just... Look, you gotta... You gotta think about last night the way she does, okay? Maybe, maybe sleeping together was the perfect way to say goodbye?  Maybe now you can actually do it. You know? You can finally get over her.  What?  Really?  Yeah, you are!  This is so cool!  But Ross, Ross. What do you, what do you think she\\'s going to say?  Good luck, good luck!  Oh, hey, hey, can I give you guys your house-warming present now?  Alright!  Ah... Chick Jr.? Duck Jr.? Don\\'t hide from mama!  Quack, quack, tweet, tweet, quack, quack, tweet, tweet, quack, quack, tweet, tweet, quack, quack, tweet, tweet, quack, tweet, quack...  Okay, I wanted to surprise you, but for your house-warming gift, I got you a baby-chick and a baby-duck!  Yeah, yeah, they must have jumped off the table, \\'cause now they\\'re gone!  Oh!  You stepped on my egg roll?  Just put it on a plate and leave.  Alright.  Wait, wait. Do you hear that?  Oh! They\\'re in the table!  We gotta get them out of there!  Oh, oh! Maybe we can lure them out. You know any birdcalls?  Well, maybe we can just tip the table a little.  Oh!  Oh God! So what do we do?  Okay.  Does that mean we have to bust it open?  Oh my God!  All right, you know what? We don\\'t have a choice. It\\'s like I would have said in that sci-fi movie if I\\'d gotten the part. \"Those are our men in there, we have to get them out! Even if I have to sacrifice the most important thing in my life; my time-machine.\"  It did not.  Okay. Here goes.  I need to say goodbye to the table first.  Okay. Table, you have given us so many great times. And you guys, Jordan, Victor, Joel... All of you guys. What can I say? You guys make us look good. You wanna say anything?  Okay, here we go. I can\\'t do it.  Yeah, they\\'re stuck inside the table!  Yeah, you didn\\'t even use the tools for most of it!  Yeah.  Probably not. Nah. I don\\'t know how much I\\'m gonna wanna play after you go.  Yeah.  I\\'m gonna miss these little guys. It was nice having birds around again.  What?  I could get a goose!  Thanks man. Did you hear that, you guys? You\\'re gonna get to stay here! And, and it\\'s good, you know, \\'cause, \\'cause now you have a reason to come visit.  Uh, lame cool guy handshake, yeah.  Yeah. Uh, does this mean there\\'s nothing to eat?  I love you!  Hey!  So did you guys make it in time?  Has it always been purple?  Yeah. I guess so.  Maybe he found you flip-flop.  Whoa! Is this porn? What did I do? I must’ve hit something on the remote.  No, we didn’t even pay our cable bill—maybe this is how they punish us.  Yeah, so no one touches the remote. And no one touches the TV!  Imagine a protective porn bubble if you will, okay?  Hey.  Pheebs! You’re blocking the porn! Look out!  Yeah right.  Yeah, he likes porn.  Hey!  Yeah, what were you trying to get her to do?!  You play hard to get.  Then you go to Tokyo.  Way to be strong, man!  Oh yeah, sure, that makes sense. Yeah. ‘Cause you already told her you love her and she didn’t say it back, then she called you and told you that there’s another guy, so yeah, go to London that’ll scare her!  Hey.  Same kind of thing happened to me! Woman pizza delivery guy come over, gives me the pizza, takes the money, and leaves!  Noo! Nothing!  I think you’re right.  One.  That’s kinda nice.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah!!  Hey, what is with the secrecy Phoebe? Huh? And what about this Denise, is she cute?  Hey Rach, listen I was thinkin’ uh, I’m gonna have an extra room over at my place…  Yeah, why don’t you move in with me? It’ll be great! We could stay up late, watch movies, and you know about Naked Thursday’s right?  Hey, what’s up?  Whoa!! Now look, don’t be just blurtin’ stuff out. I want you to really think about your answers. Okay?  Oh don’t listen to him, he’s just some guy who really wants the apartment, but I don’t think he’s gonna get it.  Umm, listen, Ross do you really think this moving in with Rachel is a good idea?  Yeah well, maybe you should go back! Okay? Rachel moves in, and before you know it you’re right where you don’t want to be! Back together!  That’s not gonna work out! Then she’s gonna come home all weepy and you’ll be tellin’ her, \"Oh that’s okay. You’ll find someone.\" And then, bamn! She finds you!  I am telling you Ross, she is definitely gonna fall in love with you again! Now, is that what you want?  Here she comes. Hold on, I’m gonna make your life much easier.  No-no-no-no-no-no-no-no… It’s okay, I mean I—look Rach, I know I scared you off with that whole Naked Thursday’s thing, but we don’t have to do that!  Thursday’s clearly not good for ya, pick a day!  Come in. Thanks for comin’ back, umm, okay there have been a lot of people interested in the room, but I have narrowed it down and you are one of the finalists!  Okay now, before I make my final decision I uh, I just want to make sure our personalities match. Okay, so I made up a little test. Now, I’m gonna say a word and then you say the first thing that comes to mind.  Okay! Here we go. Pillow.  Very good! Okay. G.  Excellent! Okay umm, doggy.  Whoa-whoa, Treeger made you cry?  I’m gonna go down there and teach that guy a lesson.  Hey! You hold on pal! Now you made my friend, Rachel, cry. So now, you’re gonna go up there and apologize to her, unless you want me to call the landlord.  Have you heard about a little something called, Not Making Girls Cry.  I have actually not heard of that.  He said that he wasn’t gonna apologize because you guys are living here illegally, so instead what he’s gonna do is have you evicted—I’ll see you later.  Well he made Rachel cry!  All right! I’ll try! But if I can’t, you can stay with Chandler and I until you get settled.  Please don’t kick Monica and Rachel out, this wasn’t there fault, it was mine.  No you can’t do that, where would the chick and the duck live?  Noo-no-no, no, those are nicknames. I’m the chick and Chandler is the duck.  Come on man, just-just let the girls stay, I’ll do whatever you want.  Yeah-yeah, absolutely.  What, what is it?  That’s not, prison lingo, is it?  Yeah, there’s this superintendent’s dance, the Super Ball. I don’t know, and he wants to impress Marge, this lady super that he’s a crush on.  Well, he’s too shy, he doesn’t thing he’s good enough to dance with girls yet.  Aww, man, now we won’t be bank buddies!  Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Like-like when I’m doing something exciting and I don’t wanna get too excited, I just ahh, y’know try to thing of other things like ah sandwiches, and ah baseball, and ah Chandler!  No-no, thank you.  All right, I’m here, let’s ahh, get this over with.  Whoa-whoa, don’t we need to do some kinda preparation first? Like ahh, get really drunk?  No, it’s okay, but if I’m Marge, my breasts are coming out my back.  Come on man, you’re not a potato.  What?  No I didn’t.  No, I’m not! And it wasn’t a hop it was a pademarie.  All right, well maybe I’m enjoying it a little bit. I mean I’m getting pretty good at it.  Hey-hey, hold on, this isn’t some kind of like girly dance. All right, it’s like a sport, it’s manly!  All right.  I don’t know how to lead.  What?!  Look, you wanna use our place?  We did it!!  I know, it was amazing! I mean, we totally nailed it, it was beautiful.  Oh well, okay, good luck.  Unless you wanna practice the Foxtrot again? Or-or the Tango?  Okay.  Go get ‘em Treeger.  No, I’m good.  Hey!  Ross and Rachel left us a message saying they were getting married! Isn’t that why you guys are here?  Well! What happened?! Did we miss it?  Nah, I’m too depressed to eat. I’ll probably eat in like 5 minutes. So I guess I’ll just fly home with you guys, what time’s your flight?  I don’t need that anymore.  It’ll be great! We-we could talk, and play games! Huh? This could be our chance to like renew our friendship.  Sure?  Hey.  Where is the waitress?! I’m starving!  Oh! Tell her she’s not marriage material.  Girls say it to me all the time! And believe me, if she’s anything like me, she’s just gonna be relieved.  They let you get married when you’re drunk! Most people who get married in Vegas are drunk!  An annulment? Ross! I don’t think surgery’s the answer here.  All right. All right.  Really? I don’t…  Don’t you think I asked him that before he got in?!  Ooh, I’ll play! I’ll play!  Pheebs, I am so sorry! I know I promised you a fun road trip with your friend and I didn’t deliver. But-but-but now I know that you think being awake is an important part of friendship! So, so, so I will strive to-to stay awake for as long as I know you.  Well, thank you. So, can we play 20 Questions now? I’ve got a really good one! I’ve been thinking about it since Kansas.  Yes.  That is incredible! You are the master!  What are you doing?  I’m not finished.  Hey, it\\'s me! I\\'m comin\\' in!  Ahh, I\\'m gonna go get some chicken. Want some?  Okay.  You sure? Some extra crispy? Dirty rice? Beans?  All right!  Mornin\\' Pheebs!  Oh, he was this cab driver we had in London.  Yeah-yeah-yeah, and they had that beer! That uh…  Hey, Ross, Bodington\\'s!  That was good beer.  Y\\'know, I\\'d walk back to London for another frosty one of those bad boys.  Hey, Pheebs!  I\\'ll kick that door in if you give me a little sugar.  Uh, okay, Pheebs?  Umm, y\\'know how the other day you were talking about how you didn\\'t get to go to London and how you were kinda feeling left out?  All right, well, we felt really bad about that so we decided we should all take a little trip together!  Yeah, all of us! All day!  Phoebe!  Mine!  Nooo, I said we needed a new plan.  Which, is the new plan!  Uh, Pheebs, you\\'re leaking?  Ohh-oh, wasn’t he cheating on you with her?  So Monica, still going out with Dr. Boring huh?  Hey.  Hey man, look sorry about that Archie thing. Do uh, do you need me to give you some money?  Really?  That’s great! That would be great! Let’s do that!  Oh right great! Welcome aboard!  All right! Now hey, I need to use the bathroom. Since I don’t need any assistance in there, take a break!  Well, it’s always nice to meet the fans.  All right, and over there is Brady’s Pub where I like to unwind after a long day of surgeoning.  All righty, what do you say we head back to my place?  Okay, you watch too much TV.  I thought we talked about this. I don’t like pulp. No pulp. Pulp isn’t juice. All juice, okay?  Fresh squeezed orange juice, with pulp! Just the way you like it.  Oh my God! That’s great! Congratulations! What’s the story?!  Are you kidding me?! I love Archie! And the whole gang!  Wait a minute. That sounds a little familiar! Did they already do that one? ‘Cause I think I read it!  Pretty cool, huh? But if you’re thinking you can put a fish in there and it wouldn’t get sucked up into the mechanism, well you’d be wrong.  Yeah, life’s pretty great isn’t it?  Well, with Dr. Drake they always tell me what to say. And with Joey, I pretty much have to make it up on my own.  Yeah you did.  Here you go. Let me ask you a question.  When was the last time someone told you just how beautiful you are?  Come, come here.  Yeah.  Well he actually saw you a little bit too.  No! No! No, not after seeing that.  Wh-why?  That’s ridiculous! I’m not a \"Star,\" just a regular famous actor.  Rachel, would you stop saying that?! Hey-hey look, remember on the show when-when Caprice was dying and she gave me…  Sure! As long as they don’t find out you can keep whatever you want! And I want you to have it.  Yes! Yes!! And every time you look at it, I want you to remember that you are a good person. Okay, you’ve had the chance to cheat, and with me, but you didn’t. And that’s what this ring stands for.  Look, do you want the ring or not?!  Hey!  All right!  Whoa-whoa-whoa! You’re not gonna use the pay phone to call work, are ya?  You?  Wow!  All right! So, was it amazing?  Just okay—Did you do it right?!  Huh. But still Ross, you’re worst day with two women, pretty much better than any other day! Y’know what I mean?  But you got to be with both of them, right?  Not the other one?  Yeah, you don’t want that.  Well hey, at least you got to see a lot of stuff, right?  You got a little bored?  Yeah? What did ya have?  Sounds good.  Yeah?  Is it the shampoo? It’s guava.  Hey, what have you guys been up too?  Wow! You guys seem to be having a good time.  Hey that’s what all my relationships are like.  Hey, but at least you got that cool, pregnant lady glow.  Yeah, what’ going on?  Awwww!  What-what-what is so funny?  Now that’s a thinker.  A little salami.  Pastrami.  Oh! I know how you can get him, take off your bra.  There was a seen in Footloose...  Yeah-yeah, yeah, with that-that uh, plumber girl…  What? Were you like in the movie, or… Anyway, she takes off her bra under her shirt and pulls it out the sleeve. Very sexy, and classy.  If you didn’t want to play, why did you come to the party?  Phoebe, what-what are you doing?!  All right look, y’know how-y’know how when you’re dating someone and you don’t want to cheat on them, unless it’s with someone really hot?  Feel better now?  Hey, what if I said, I could even things out for ya, meatwise.  Well, I eat a lot of meat right?  Well, suppose until the baby’s born I laid off it. No extra animals would die, you-you’d just be eating my animals.  Absolutely! I could be a vegetarian. There’s no meat in beer, right?  Oooh, what you got there?  Oh-ho-ho, yeah! Hey! Y’know what goes good with that?  Ooh, I was gonna say bologna, but that’s much better. How about a little of that smoked turkey?  Ugh. Now if a cow should die of natural causes, I can have one of those right?  What?  Eyes! No, no. Your eyes! No. Chandler’s eyes!  Feminine.  Great! I’m finally getting into this sailing stuff.  Why would I do that? It took three guys to get the thing in there!  You could?  All right.  Uh, boat rope.  Uhh, rub it?  I’d say, come again. No-no, wait I-I-I know this one, I know this one, uh…  And deaf!  Yes.  I want to make a ship to shore call to Chandler.  Oh uh, I don’t know the boat way to say this, but uh never!  Because! You’re mean on the boat!  Well, lesson learned! Rachel is mean!  Does a good teacher say, \"Put down the beer pinhead!?\"  Six and a half! You knocked that last one out of my hand! Remember?  Well it hit me anyway! And it would’ve hurt a lot less if I had finished that last beer.  You won’t boss me around anymore?  And you’ll be nice?  And you’ll be topless?  Do you want me to learn?!  Ohh yeah.  Nope.  I don’t know why you just don’t say left.  Huh?  Uh, wow, you just said a bunch of stuff I didn’t know there.  Oh, y’know, when we did that was when that bird was flying overhead with the fish in his mouth. Did you see it? It was gross!  All right that’s it! You’re yelling and I don’t see you taking your top off! I quit!  Why not?!  Greens? I’m a Tribbiani! And Tribbianis quit!  Yes! Yes! You did and you’re still yelling at me!  Well, hey I did learn.  Yeah! Come on.  Damnit!  Just pull on it.  What else?  Thank you.  What are you doing?  What you—don’t hold it like that! You’re lettin’ all the good stuff fall out.  Hey!  No.  Cool!  That\\'s great! Hey, can you cast me in it?  Oh! Any word on casting yet?  What do you mean? Rach, don\\'t I seem like a professor you\\'d buy some kind of e-crap from?  Just watch it, and if you don\\'t like it, you don\\'t pass it on to your bosses!  Just pass it to your boss!  What\\'s up?  Look, it\\'s one thing not to cast me, but to lie to me?  Keep going Pinocchio!  You still here?  I got it from Monica. She sold it to me for a very reasonable price.  But it\\'s an original Buffay...  Hey? what? what? wey! whoo! what? what!?  GET THAT LEGLESS WITCH OUT OF HERE!  That\\'s not the point Chandler. The point is that you lied.  Now, what do you say?  And?... AND?  Gladys?  You\\'re mean!  Ooh, sorry. Sorry. You finish, go.  I’m gonna be on two TV shows!  Oh, you weren’t finished?  Uh Rach, if you’re gonna start another story, at least let me finish mine.  Well, these really are the days of our lives.  Well, since you ask. They want me back on Days of Our Lives!  I’ll be playing Drake Remoray’s twin brother, Stryker!  Hey Terry!  It’s been a while, huh? Wow, it’s funny these halls look smaller then they used to.  So! Stryker Remoray huh? When do you want me to start?  Okay.  Well, I was Dr. Drake Remoray, Stryker’s twin brother. I mean, who looks more me than me right?  Hey.  Was she happy you gave her the job?  Why would they do that?! It was a good show right?!  How could this happen to me?! Yesterday I had two TV shows! Today, I got nothin’!  Uh, well they might be a little mad at me over there.  Well maybe I got a little upset and maybe I told them where they could go.  Because they wanted me to audition!  Hey! Terry.  Wait! Terry! Wait—Look—Wait I-I… Look, I’m really sorry about before. I was an idiot thinking I’m too big to audition for you. You gotta give me another chance.  Wait! Terry! Please! Look, I just lost my other job. Okay? You have no idea how much I need this. Please, help me out, for old times sake.  Nothing! It was something.  Yeah, that’s sad. Mashuga nut?  Oh my God Pheebs! You’re gonna have a baby?  Whoa, wait a minute. Who’s the father?  Well who is this guy?! Huh? Who is he? ‘Cause I will track him down and kick his ass!  Okay.  Oh good, uh you’re here. Uh Pheebs? Listen uh sit down. I-I got something I want to say.  Why?! Why can’t she marry me?!  Oh my God.  Ohh… I wonder if that dude.  Yeah.  The guy left this.  Well, I don’t know. I think it does something to salami.  Yeah. What-what did Tag say?  Hey Rach listen, no matter what this guy says I want you to know you’re not gonna be alone in this.  Pheebs, give me the ring back!  Uh yeah. Pheebs, listen about that. I only offered…  There you go!  Well, I know what I’m giving you for Christmas.  Ohhh!  Hey, Mon! I’m not doing anything, why don’t you fire me?  Good enough to get fired.  Hey! That must be why I got fired last week! Does this Orson Wells guy direct Burger King commercials?  What are you talking about? Lots of things rhyme with Rachel. Bagel. Mail. Jail. Bail. Able. May-pole.  Sure! Where are the seats?  Now, wait a second! You make food and robots?  Yeah, lady, I do! I got a problem with that!  Oh, what are you gonna do? You’re gonna fire me?  It’s still a tiny bit on fire there.  Yeah. Listen uh, I’d prefer it if you didn’t call me Joey. Since I don’t know anyone here, I thought it’d be cool to try out a cool work nickname.  No ma’am.  And I gotta pay rent! Look, how-how about this? You don’t fire me, instead I stay here, I gain their trust, and they’ll start listening to all the nice things I’ve been saying about you.  Well nothing yet, they really hate you and I want to fit in.  You bet I do! I just ah, wasn’t listening then, that’s all.  What are you gonna do? You’re gonna fire me?  Well I guess I should’ve thought about my wife and kids before I talked back to chef Geller!  Yep! Looks like it’s gonna be a leeeeean Christmas at the Dragon house this year.  We have a half hour.  Relax Ross, we\\'ll be ready. It only takes us two minutes to get dressed.  Hey, Ross, want some cider?  Glass of fat?  What\\'s a matter Ross? What you\\'re nervous about your speech?  Am I in it?  Whoa!  What?  How is this your seat?  But then you left.  What\\'s the big deal, sit somewhere else.  All right! You can have the chair.  I\\'m so sorry.  Me too. In fact, I think I might be a little too comfortable.  Monica, how are you gonna do that?  Hey, you can\\'t say you\\'re breezy, that, that totally negates the breezy.  Now she sounded breezy.  You said I had to give you the chair, you didn\\'t say anything about the cushions.  That\\'s right! I\\'m taking the essence.  Because, I\\'m not wearing any underwear now.  It\\'s a rented tux. Okay. I\\'m not gonna go commando in another man\\'s fatigues.  Okay, you hide my clothes. I\\'m gonna do the exact opposite to you.  Okay, buddy-boy. Here it is. You hide my clothes, I\\'m wearing everything you own.  Look at me! I\\'m Chandler! Could I be wearing any more clothes? Maybe if I wasn\\'t going commando...  Yeah, Ross, way to ruin it. I was just going to get dressed.  You could drink the fat.  Yaaaay!  Let\\'s see what else he\\'ll do!  Right! And when is that due?  And that’s every month?  Ahhh.  No-no! No way! Joey Tribbiani does not take charity…anymore.  No! Forget it! Okay—I mean thanks, but I’m done taking money from you. All right, I can take of myself. Now, what’s next? Come on.  This is how much we pay for electric?!!!  Hey!  I don’t know Ross, not if you’re gonna talk about how you gave up a career in basketball to become a paleontologist.  Here it is! Our last pizzas together as roommates.  Oh that’s okay. Hey, actually in a way it’s kinda nice. Me, bringing the food of my ancestors, you, the food of yours!  What, are you crazy? You haven’t beaten me once since my injury plagued ’97 season. It would be easier if you just give me your money.  Okay, you’re on.  You serious?  Okay, get ready to owe me!  Okay, here we go. Ready?  This sucks man! The last night you’re here and I lose the two most important things in my life, the foosball table and $500.  Nah, not my game.  Well, what’s it called?  I don’t know how to play Cups.  All right.  A two and a five.  Really?!  A four and a nine.  No. Why?  Damn! I am good at Cups!  Well, what did you have?  Yeah.  What?  Really?  Hey!  Ross and I were helping the girls pack, took a little break, I lost $1,500 to him in Cups!  The same way you lost. I started out with a King and a Queen, bamn! Ross gets a 2 and a 3. Then I get a Jack and a King, boom! Ross gets a 4 and a 5! Ross was getting the Cup card, the D-Cup, the Sittin’ Down Bonus! Meanwhile, I didn’t even get half a cup! Nothin’!!  And he never played before either! Y’know what I think? I think beginner’s luck, very important in Cups.  It’s him, not it!  Wait a second, I see what you’re trying to do here! You-you’re trying to give me money again!  I will be okay! Look Chandler, you gotta get it out of your head that I can’t take care of myself. Okay? Look, I’m not gonna miss you helping me out with money. The only thing that I’m gonna miss…is you. And now the dog.  Okay listen, how are you gonna ask her?  That sounds perfect!  You’re gonna mess it up let me do it.  Hey!  Hey Rach!  Where are you going?  Hey, y’know what? I’ll come too. I’m making money now; it’s about time I give something back.  Okay. Have a benefit.  It’s the big night! We wanted to wish you good luck!  Hey!  I won! That was my guess!  I guessed 20,000!  What?! I don’t have 20,000!  I didn’t know it was an auction!  I figured, take a guess, help a charity, free boat!  I don’t know! Charity?  Oh hi!  Just out of curiosity, how-how much is that boat worth?  Well, what am I gonna do Rach?! I don’t have that kind of money!  Okay.  Look, I don’t know why the kids need a youth center anyway! Y’know? They should just watch TV after school like I did and I turned out fine!  Rach! Rachel! Okay, the next highest bidder is at table one.  Uhh, excuse me is there a Mr. Bowmont at this table?  You-you have to pay that! It’s not just a guess.  Are you kidding me?! She’s gonna this boat!  Aw-awww!  Oooooh…  No way! It’s mine!!  All that stuff you just said? I want that!  Who cares?! I-I’ll make payments, whatever it takes, I want the Mr. Bowmont!!  Oh my God, you’re back!  Yeah.  We didn’t ruin it!  Glove salesman!  That guy’s still doing that?!  Hey!  Hey uh, have you guys scene Chandler?  Hey Monica!  This is for my boat, pretty cool huh?  Whoa-whoa, what’s the matter?! Talk to the captain!  Chandler giving you a hard time huh?  Well, you know Chandler.  Maybe you changed?  Maybe that’s the problem.  Chandler is a complex fellow, one who is unlikely to take a wife.  Monica face it, Chandler is against marriage. And-and always will be!  There are?  Chandler loves marriage!!  You got that from what I said?!  Where the hell have you been?!  Richard told Monica he wants to marry her!  I know! They suck!!  I know!  Look, Chandler I don’t think us getting our asses kicked is a solution. Okay? Just go and find Monica!  Yeah!  Okay.  Dude-dude-dude!  Let me know about that coconut phone, it might great for the boat.  No we weren’t!  Pick me!!  This is crazy! Hey look, I wanna switch to Rachel!  Okay that’s fair.  Yeah.  Dude!  She’s gone.  She’s gone. She had a bag and she left.  She was all crying. She-she said you guys want different things, and that and that she needed time to think.  I-I did! I told her everything, Chandler! But she wouldn’t believe me.  To her parent’s I think and she said you shouldn’t call her. But if I were you I would.  I am so sorry man.  Yeah!  Hey you guys. Hey, you all know my dad, right?  Since then?!  ...I d\\'know.  Oh man. Please tell me one of \\'em is Ma.  What\\'s the matter with Rog?  Night, you guys.  Hey. Can, uh, can we help you?  I\\'m Joey Tribbiani.  Dad, Ronni\\'s here.  Who-ah-ho.  No you won\\'t.  If you go to a hotel you\\'ll be...doing stuff. I want you right here where I can keep an eye on you.  That\\'s right, mister, and I don\\'t care how old you are, as long as you\\'re under my roof you\\'re gonna live by my rules. And that means no sleeping with your girlfriend.  Now dad, you\\'ll be in my room, Ronni uh, you can stay in Chandler\\'s room.  Okay. Now this is just for tonight. Starting tomorrow, you gotta make a change. This has gone on long enough.  Well, either you break it off with Ronni  Then you gotta come clean with Ma! This is not right!  I don\\'t wanna hear it! Now go to my room!  Just trying to get comfortable. I can\\'t sleep in my underwear.  I\\'ve been thinking. Y\\'know, about how I\\'m always seeing girls on top of girls...  Y\\'know what I mean, about how I\\'m always going out with all these women. And I always figured, when the right one comes along, I\\'d be able to be a stand-up guy and go the distance, y\\'know? Now I\\'m looking at my dad, thinking...  No.  You really think so?  Ma! What\\'re you doing here?  Oww! Big ring!  Hold on, you-you knew?  So then how could you I mean, how could you?!  Ma, I don\\'t mean to be disrespectful, but... what the hell are you talking about?! I mean, what about you?  I\\'m...happy...for you?  Ma, I\\'m sorry. I just did what I thought you\\'d want.  Yeah. You\\'re ten times prettier than she is.  Yeah. He\\'s gonna keep cheating on my ma like she wanted, she\\'s gonna keep pretending she doesn\\'t know even though she does, and my little sister Tina can\\'t see her husband any more because he got a restraining order...which has nothing to do with anything except that I found out today.  Yeah, I guess. It\\'s just parents, after a certain point, you gotta let go. Even if you know better, you\\'ve gotta let them make their own mistakes.  Sorry. Wrong boobies.  Yeah. It\\'s actually our first official date  Naa, no. This is the part I\\'m actually good at.  Well, I... I know exactly what I\\'m gonna do!  No, no no no no. See. Each woman is different.You have to appreciate their uniqueness.  No, I do six things! First, I look deep in her eyes. Then, I kiss her. Next I take my hand and I softly graze her thigh.  More foosball?  Yeah.  Hey what do you say, we move this onto the likes of the couch?  What’s the matter?  I don’t get it, Chandler loved it!  Ok.  Rach, you sure you wanna do this?  Ok. Well, how, how can we make it easier?  Ok, yeah, got it.  This thing welded shut?!  All right, turn around, I got to get a look at this thing.  Sorry!  Then I blame you! Yeah! That\\'s right! You threw me off with all your slapping!  Yes ma\\'am, ready to Power through!  Ok, you\\'re scaring me a little bit.  Oh! yeah!  uh uh!  No, no, no! You kneed me in my misters!  Well, I know what\\'s the matter with me.  I don\\'t know.  Yeah, was there a part of you that... felt like it was... really wrong?  Yeah, yeah... Absolutely. I mean, just because something\\'s difficult doesn\\'t mean that you quit.  Yeah, so we just keep trying and trying until we... do it.  That\\'s a... pla-an.  I don\\'t get it. I mean, I was so sure this was what I wanted.  I guess they weren\\'t as good friends as we are.  So...  I love ya.  Yeah, me too.  Ooh, yeah, I\\'m not going anywhere for a while.  Yep. Hey, what do you say we make it a double feature?  Die Hard 2.  Oh, well we watch it a second time and its Die Hard 2!  And?  What are you talking about? Bitch.  Well, I don’t know!!  Yeah. Yep. Yeah. All right, well uh, I’d better go.  Yeah. All right, I’ll talk to you later.  Hey! What’s going on?  Hey-hey-hey-hey, I can help you decide who should do it! Yeah, we could have like uh, like an audition and see how you’d handle maid of honor type situations.  Like when I want a job, I go to an audition and if I’m the best of the people they see, they give me the part.  Oh uh, me and Ross can be the judges.  Hi.  Uh hey look uh Ross, look I think we need to talk about before.  Yes we do! Now look, that was the best nap I ever had!!  Come on! Admit it! That was the best nap you ever had!  Okay! When?!  Uh-huh!  I want to do it again.  Why not?  Fine! Do you want something to drink?  Okay, all right, this is how it’s going to work. We’re gonna give you hypothetical maid of honor situations and you will be scored on a scale of 1 to 10, 1 being the highest.  Why is 10 the highest?  I’ve got cold feet.  No, one man for the rest of my life? I don’t know if I can do it! This means I’ll never get to sleep with Joey!  Okay, Phoebe…  We’re now in the ceremony, Monica is about to say, \"I do\" when her drunk uncle starts yelling. What do you do? Go!  Yes! Excellent! Perfect score!  Yeah.  And she’s back in the game.  All right, well first of all I would like to say that you both performed very well. Okay? You should be proud of yourselves. And-and I would also like to say that in this competition there are no losers. Well, except for Rachel—Damnit!  Boy I tell ya, that judging stuff took a lot out of me.  No reason, I’m just saying that uh… That’s where I’ll be.  Great nap.  Whadja think?  C\\'mon, you guys, it wasn\\'t that bad. It was better than that thing I did with the trolls, at least you got to see my head.  The Estelle Leonard Talent Agency. Wow, an agency left me its card! Maybe they wanna sign me!  Who\\'s Rick?  I couldn\\'t do it.  When I\\'m with a woman, I need to know that I\\'m going out with more people than she is.  Can you believe this? Al Pacino! This guy\\'s the reason I became an actor! \"I\\'m out of order? Pfeeeh. You\\'re out of order! This whole courtroom\\'s out of order!\"  \"Just when I thought I was out, they pull me back in!\"  ...I\\'m his butt double. \\'Kay? I play Al Pacino\\'s butt. Alright? He goes into the shower, and then- I\\'m his butt.  C\\'mon, you guys. This is a real movie, and Al Pacino\\'s in it, and that\\'s big!  Okay, okay, fine! Make jokes, I don\\'t care! This is a big break for me!  Here. I need to borrow some moisturizer.  Whaddya think? Today\\'s the big day!  Uh, listen, I just wanna thank you for this great opportunity.  Me?  Well, I\\'m- I\\'m showering.  Oh. Well, the way I see it, the guy\\'s upset here, y\\'know? I mean, his wife\\'s dead, his brother\\'s missing... I think his butt would be angry here.  I was going for quiet desperation. But if you have to ask...  Nope.  I got fired.  Yeah, they said I acted too much with it. I told everybody about this! Now everybody\\'s gonna go to the theatre, expecting to see me, and...  My mom will.  Y\\'know, I\\'ve done nothing but crappy plays for six years. And I finally get my shot, and I blow it!  Hard to tell, I was naked.  So I just talked to one of the DOOL writers today, and…  Days Of Our Lives. Anyway, you’re not gonna believe it! My character is coming out of his coma!!  And-and-and not only that, I’m gettin’ a new brain!!  Oh well, they’re killing off one of the characters on the show, and when she dies her brain is being transplanted into my body.  Well, I think it’s ridiculous that you haven’t had sex in three and a half months.  Uh Cecilia Monroe, she plays Jessica Lockhart.  Nice.  Oh, tell me about it. And she’s been on the show forever, it’s gonna be really hard to fill her shoes.  That was a great scene! And-and-and that slap looks so real! How do you do that?  Oh anyway, I just wanted to say how wonderful I think you are.  Say what?  No. No, I’m Joey Tribbiani; we did a scene together yesterday. I-I’m the guy in the coma!  An-an-anyway I-I just wanted to say that since I’m getting your brain when you leave the show, I was wondering if there was any tips you can give me…  Oh uh, one of the writers.  Umm…  Okay.  So you like the nachos uh? Myself I’m partial to…  I’m so sorry. Look, if it was up to me you would never leave the show.  No I mean it! I can’t believe they would do this to you! And to your fans! I mean they are going to be devastated! Heart broken! They love you so much!  Joey.  Uh yeah-ye-ye-ye-ye-ye—l-l-l-l-l-look the-the-the only reason that I, that I came up to you before was because well, I’m really nervous about-about being you. Y’know if you can help me capture the essence of the character. Y’know? Help me keep Jessica alive. Please?  Oh that’s great! Oh thank you so much!  Yeah.  Oh well—Hey-hey! Maybe, maybe uh, maybe this is a good thing. Y’know? It’ll-it’ll give you a chance to shake things up, play different characters. You’re so talented.  Hey that’s not true! Look at uh, look at Angela Lansb—Angelina Jolie!  Like-like what?  Yeah-yeah, I noticed that! Is that ‘cause she’s so passionate?  Actually I rent the whole place and, I just got what you meant. Thank you.  Hey!  That uh, that is my roommate Rachel.  Okay, bye-bye.  They sent me today’s script! They never send the script!  Yeah well, I’m guessing after this she’s not going to be crazy about electricity either.  Oh noo…  Thanks!  Great! Hey! All right! Well-well what is it?!  The airport?  Ohh. Wow! Well how-how, how will you be gone?  That’s a really long time.  Good luck.  All right, all right, all right, let\\'s play one more time, ok? And remember, if I win you do not move to Paris.  Just flip!  Damnit!  Hey!  You guys hear a ringing?  Hey! Handcuffs! And fur line, nice! I didn\\'t know you guys had it in ya!  Mhm, maybe she used them with another boyfriend. Maybe Richard!  Oh, she\\'s putting Emma down, she\\'ll be over in a second.  Now it just hit her that she\\'s leaving and she\\'s kind of emotional so no one say anything to set her off, ok?  What did I just say?  I forgot to pick up my dry cleaning!  Huh, if I had to guess I\\'d say Rachel is putting on the bubble wrap and Phoebe is doing the punching.  I really made you think about that thing uh?  All right, let\\'s think about this. I mean, there\\'s got to be an explanation. Uh... did you do anything to make her mad?  I\\'m sure he\\'s not more bummed out than I am.  Who\\'s that dirty old lady?  Come on here, have a seat.  Chandler, wait, wait, wait...  If you get a second, find out where she got that cheeseburger.  A little more.  Yeah. All right, now give me your best shot.  Okay, Ross, I realise that you didn\\'t expect to walk in and see that, but.. Let me explain, okay?  Rach, he just saw us.  But what you saw, that is the extent of it, okay? One kiss.  Look, we probably should have talked to you about this before it ever happened, but..  Yeah, but it did happen, so...  Ross?  No, no, no!  Probably.  No, no!  Really?  Ross..  Look, don\\'t you think that will be a little weird?  I do like fajitas.  Ah, can I just say I know we\\'re doing this for Ross, and that\\'s cool, but if it was up to me, this is not what we\\'d be doing on our first date.  I\\'d take you out for a romantic night. Some champagne, fancy dinner, feel you up on the carriage ride home...  In a carriage!  Hey, Charlie!  So, did you bring a little something for Ross?  Oh. Oh, thanks.  Yeah, I didn\\'t throw any of that out..  Uh, actually, that\\'s..  Okay, listen, hey, Ross. Why don\\'t you try to relax, okay? Maybe have a drink.  Dude, are you okay? And when are the fajitas gonna be ready?  Dude, are you okay?  You know what? I think I\\'m gonna stay here and make sure he\\'s okay.  Yeah. I\\'ll see you in the morning.  It doesn\\'t look good, does it?  Morning. Here you go.  Yeah.  No, no, no. You actually did that when you were dancing to the Chicago-soundtrack. Look, Ross, about, about Rachel and I. Listen, you don\\'t have to worry about that, okay? Because nothing is gonna happen.  Well, she and I said from the beginning that we weren\\'t gonna do anything unless you were okay with it. And clearly..  It\\'s okay, Ross, alright? I totally understand. Of course you\\'re not fine. You\\'re.. You\\'re Ross and Rachel.  That\\'s what I hear, yeah.  Come on, I mean, you know me, you know...  I\\'m crazy about her.  I think so.  Yeah, but, Ross, I mean, you\\'re not okay with it.  No, no, no, no, that was - that was just for me. Are you sure about this?  And we\\'re okay?  The guy still won\\'t put out, huh?  Maybe he, uhh... drives his car on the other side of the road, if ya know what I mean.  Maybe he\\'s. . . gay.  Woah, woah, woah, you have a date?  But uh, uh, what about uh, Ross and uh. . .?  What?  Phoebe, that\\'s crazy. When I first met you, you know what I said to Chandler? I said, \"Excellent butt, great rack.\"  Phoebs look, if you want to know what the deal is, you\\'re just gonna have to ask him.  Hey Phoebs.  And?  All right Phoebs, way to go.  So, so how did it happen?  And what did he say?  Wow.  Let me get this straight. He got you to beg to sleep with him, he got you to say he never has to call you again, and he got you thinking this was a great idea.  This man is my God.  Am I psyched? The lead in my own TV series? I’ve dreamed about this for years! Why have I not been preparing?!  But I got to act with a robot Pheebs, and-and I don’t know anything about technology! I can’t even use Chandler’s computer except to find porn! And-and that’s only ‘cause it’s right there when you turn it on!  Okay. Hey uh, when do I get to meet the robot?  Okay.  Well, I-I just, I just it was going to be like a really cool robot, y’know? Like the terminator or uh, when I first saw you.  I’m sorry, it just—I don’t know it doesn’t really look like it can do anything.  Hey!  Pretty great! Except I did get a little attitude from the robot.  Anyway, it wasn’t the robot, it was the guy who controls him. Yeah, he doesn’t like me. He had C.H.E.E.S.E. knock over the sandwich right when I was reaching for one! Ohh!  Wow!  I’m the lead in Mac and C.H.E.E.S.E.!!  Apparently, there’s like a million guys out there that can play Mac, and there’s only this one robot and this one guy who controls it! I didn’t know he could get me fired! What am I going to do?  Thanks, but I kinda have a problem to deal with here.  I can’t believe I’m going to lose this job!  Yeah! Help me get this mini-fridge past the security guard.  Yeah?  What are you in love with her or something?  Well, it turns out you were right C.H.E.E.S.E.  Rach, I told you everything I knew last night! Look, it\\'s not that big of a deal, so Monica and Chandler are doing it.  Sorry. Monica and Chandler are making love.  I don\\'t know.  Ohh, I know one thing!  They did it right there on the couch.  Hey Ross!  Really?  Oh. Are you sure you don\\'t want to come? Tom Hanks, Meg Ryan, they get mail and stuff.  All right, let\\'s go Pheebs.  Maybe we should check the trash chute.  That\\'s right, he almost could. Which is exactly how I got stuck there.  He hooked up!! Tell us about her!  All right, hold on! Hold on. Hold on. This is Ross, okay? He\\'s our friend. He obviously went crazy. He obviously lost his mind.  Phoebe! Don\\'t put ideas in his head!  Damnit Phoebe!!  All right, put your 20 bucks down. First one to find the tasty treat wins. Okay?  Judge rules, no violation.  Yeah!  What?!  And the duck gets the Nutter-Butter!  Judge rules, Nutter-Butter.  Yeah.  Oh well, Chandler and Monica are over there and it\\'s kinda hard to concentrate.  Umm, hi.  Y’know what? Why don’t you just give us our souvenirs and get the hell out of here?  Hm-mm! Yeah nice necklace!  You’re welcome buddy.  Yeah! You gotta tell a girl before you tape her. Such a rookie mistake.  Yeah! Ask them if they brought their friends any souvenirs!  Hey, hang up! You get food poisoning just talkin’ to that place.  All right! I’ll have a sandwich!  Oh I think we do.  Y’know what? Don’t worry about it, you still got me and Phoebe.  Personal thing? What personal thing? I don’t know.  Hey.  Sure. What? About uh, you showering with your mom?  Whoa, for like months?  Six months? Whoa that’s rough.  The sky’s blue Ross and I had sex yesterday!  Okay. Okay. Umm…Ooh! Oh-oh, I got something. It’s this story I came up with, very romantic. I swear any woman that hears it; they’re like putty.  Okay. Now you’re gonna want to have sex with me when you hear it, but you have to remember it is just the story.  Whoa! What are you doing here? How did your date go?  Hey! Look, if it didn’t work it’s because you didn’t tell it right! Show me how you did it.  How long since you’ve seen a girl naked?  I’m not feeling it.  No! No! No Ross! I’m not hot! Are you hot?  Well you’re not selling the story! It’s like; it’s like you don’t believe it! Look, I gotta go. I got a date, but try this. Do what I do when I’m preparing for an audition. Okay? I’ll set you up with my video camera and you can record yourself and-and see what you’re doing wrong.  All right now… All right, you’re all set up. You’re good to go. Just hit record. All right?  Good luck.  Yeah?  Y’know what? This is not fair to her. Let’s just forget the tape!  Y’know, if they knew what they were doing they probably didn’t give you real names either.  Uh no Rach, he’s gone. But listen, he told us what happened and it does, it sounds like an honest mistake.  How do you know about that story?!  Um, this?  What up?!  Needs some clothes altered?  Whoa, whoa. And the fact that you dumped him because he hit on Phoebe?  Hey, Chandler, when you see Frankie, tell him Joey Tribbiani says hello. He\\'ll know what it means.  Can we see her?  How\\'re you doing?  Ooh, that bad, huh?  Look, I can sense when women are depressed and vulnerable. It\\'s one of my gifts.  You gotta tell Ross how you feel.  What about her? They\\'ve only been going out for two weeks. Ross has been in love with you for like 10 years.  Look, Rach, Rach! I\\'ve been with my share of women. In fact, I\\'ve been with like a lot of people\\'s share of women. The point is, I\\'ve never felt about anyone the way Ross felt about you.  Frankie? What\\'re you talking about?  No way. I\\'ve been going to the guy for 12 years.  Hey, when the doctor does that hernia test...  I swear to god, Dad. That\\'s not how they measure pants.  Mmh-mmh.  Barbados!  All right, let\\'s do it! 5 hour flight with Charlie, have a couple of drinks, get under that blanket and do what comes naturally.  That... never happens...  No, God, no! No! No no, I\\'m an actor. You\\'d probably recognize me from a little show called \"The Days of Our Lives\".  You don\\'t own a TV? What\\'s all your furniture pointed at??  Yeah! How you doin\\'? Yeah alright!  Hey, hey! You said you\\'re gonna wear a thong, where\\'s the thong?  You really should have been more clear about that!  Hey!  Oh! ah! eh... Britney Spears!?  Wha...? You\\'re gonna go now? I thought we could hang out?  Oh... you got yourself a very weird deal!  Yeah, yeah. I\\'ve got tons of stuff I could do. I\\'m gonna hit the beach, go swimming...  No, why?  Oh man!  Oh! Hey! Thank God you guys are here!  Everything is upside down here! It rains all day long, nobody watches tv and Ross is famous!  Hey guys!  Damnit!  It\\'s really gone?  I could teach you a speech that I memorized for auditions.  Hey don\\'t worry about that! I mean, Ross needs you! And Rachel and I will stay and help anyway we can.  I\\'m so bored! Stupid rain, we... we can\\'t do anything.  Hey, it hasn\\'t come to that yet.  Hey Rach, do you feel like going to a convention?  Well, who knew? Pharmacists are fun.  Not enough pills in the world, Rach. What about you, you\\'re the single one, seen anybody in there you like?  But what about back home, anything going on there? Anybody you like?  There it is, you\\'re blushing!  Tell me who it is.  Come on who? Who do you like? Tell me. You\\'re not getting away that easy. Who do you like, who?  What? Why not? Rach, who can you not get?  Yeah.  Right, of course. Hey, did you guys finish the speech?  Alright, hey look, and this isn\\'t over, because I really wanna know who...  Night.  He said \"erectus\"!  No, he really said it.  Erectus?  Yeah, and so funny!  Yeah! A little bit, yeah...  Uh... Charlie and I broke up.  Oh well, she said we have nothing in common.  No, it\\'s not, we have nothing in common!  I mean, she should be with someone like... Ross! You know what I mean, he uses all those big words too! Man, smart people are dull!  I feel so stupid, you know? Why... why do I keep going after the wrong girls?  Ok! All right, well... I\\'m gonna see if I can get a room for the night and I\\'ll... I\\'ll see you later!  What... for how long?  Uh, am I curious? I mean, I am as curious as... as... George!!  Yeah, he had a paper route.  No, I know, yeah I know we\\'re great but Rach no... this... this can\\'t happen!  NO! No-no-no-no-no-no! Hey! Hey, we\\'ll be fine! Li... hey, like you said: no big deal!  NO BIG DEAL!  Yeah! I\\'ll see ya later! Yeah!  Oh, so you’re playing Adrienne, huh?  Oh, no. Ah, I playing your husband, Victor. I’m Joey Tribianni.  So the ah, play’s pretty great, huh?  Oh, forget about it. She rocks!  Dr. Drake Remoray. Days of Our Lives. Voted most datable neurosurgeon by Teen Beat.  Hey, I’ve done plays before. I’m a serious actor.  See, I actually can pour milk, but I got you believing that I couldn’t. Now, see, that’s acting.  Yeah, that was real.  I hate this woman!! I hate her! She told everyone in the company about that info-mercial, and now they all keep asking me to open their drinks. Okay, and whenever I can’t do it, they’re all like-like laughing at me.  Wow, what-what do you think she wants?  Oh, oh, I got it! Pete-Chicago.  Oh, and Mississ-Pete is?  Yeah.  Oh, hey, how about this one. Ah, it’s says so in the script! Y\\'know ah, I-I don’t know why my character likes you either, I mean it says in the script here that you’re a bitch.  It does in mine!  Just because she went to Yale drama, she thinks she’s like the greatest actress since, since, sliced bread!  God, I just, I hate her! I hate her!! With her, ‘Oh, I’m so talented.’ and ‘Oh, I’m so pretty,’ and ‘Ooh, I smell so good.’  Hey, Chandler, can we please stay focused on my problem here?! Y\\'know?  Oh, yeah?! Then how come I keep thinking about her in all these sexual scenarios and stuff huh?!  Better?  Ah, Kate?  You ah, you forgot your shoes.  Hey, listen you ah....  ...feel like getting a cup of coffee?  Yeah, yeah sure, goodnight.  Wow, Pheebs! That sounds great!  Hey!  Ooh-ooh, Pheebs, you want a strong name? How about, The Hulk?  Oh, want a good name, go with Joey. Joey’s your pal. Joey’s your buddy. \"Where is everybody?\" \"Well, they’re hanging out with Joey.\"  Oh well, hey, Joey’s loveable too! But the thing about Joey is, if you need him, he’ll be there.  What do ya say? What do ya say?  I knew I shouldn’t have mentioned it! That’s what I wanted to name my kid!  Hey!  No, but I’m gonna!  Oh! Oh-oh, you gotta pick Joey! I mean, name one famous person named Chandler.  Someone you didn’t make up!  Yeah, that guy really hurt us.  All right look man, I didn’t want to bring this up, but Chandler, is the stupidest name I ever heard in my life! It’s not even a name; it’s barely even a word. Okay? It’s kinda like chandelier, but it’s not! All right? It’s a stupid, stupid non-name!  So I guess it’s Joey then!  Dude, I am sorry about what I said!  It’s not that bad.  So, you’re just Bing?  No way are you cool enough to pull of Clint.  See you later, Gene.  What’s up with Gene?  Nah, you’re not tall enough to be a Mark, but you might make a good Barney.  Hey!  Why?  You can pee here!  We\\'ve only been going out for a couple of weeks, do you think I gotta get her something?  Oh, I know...  It\\'s two gifts in one. It\\'s a pen that\\'s also a clock! Huh?  Why not?  Sure it is! She needs a pen for work, she\\'s writing, she turns it over.... \"Whoa! It\\'s time for my date with Joey!\"  She didn\\'t have a birthday while we were going out.  Thanks, man. And oh, while you\\'re at it, could you get her a card?  Or... just get a card that has a poem already in it.  So, you just left? Her place was really that bad?  Yeah.  Wow. Thanks. So, uh, what happened?  All right, so... next time, you take her to your place.  What kind of smell?  All right, listen, Ross... you like this girl, right?  You wanna see her again, right?  So you\\'re gonna have to do it in the mess!  Yeah.  Yeah!  Our place, the hall! I...  Wow. That\\'s almost as much as a new book.  Hey!  Oh, man, she loved it! She\\'s over there showing Monica and Rachel right now.  Hey, listen, I gotta tell ya, I feel kinda bad taking credit for this, because man, am I gonna get a lot of credit for this!  Hey!  Yeah, he did, look... look, it\\'s right there on the counter! Ha-ho-ho!  Cool.  Goo, goo, goo, waaah!  Are you ok, Ross?  Is he gonna be ok?  What? I have seven Catholic sisters. I\\'ve taken care of hundreds of kids. Come on, we wanna do it, don\\'t we?  Hat, milk, got it.  Consider it done.  Yeah, my uncle Sal has a really big tongue.  It\\'s gonna be worth it. It\\'s a known fact that women love babies, all righ? Women love guys who love babies. It\\'s that whole sensitive thing. Quick, aim him at that pack o\\' babes over there. Maybe one of them will break away. No, no wait, for get them, we got one, hard left. All right, gimme the baby.  No, seriously.  You wanna smell him?  Oh, yeah. He\\'s got that great baby smell. Get a whiff of his head.  Hey, hey, look at that talent.  Oh we\\'re not out. No, no. We\\'re just uh, two heterosexual guys, hanging with the son of our other heterosexual friend, doin\\' the usual straight guy stuff.  Yeah.  Get outta here. This is our stop too.  Oh, yeah, yeah, sure. We live in the building by the uh sidewalk.  Hey, look, since we\\'re neighbors and all, what do you say we uh, get together for a drink?  Hi, here\\'s the deal. We lost a carseat on a bus today. It\\'s white plastic, with a handle, and it fits onto a stroller. Oh, and there was a baby in it. He wants to talk to you again.  I\\'m him.  Well, well that one has ducks on his t-shirt, and this one has clowns. And Ben was definitely wearing ducks.  Or clowns. Oh, oh wait. That one\\'s definitely Ben. Remember, he had that cute little mole by his mouth.  Yeah.  Ahh!  Uh, uh, we\\'ll flip for it. Ducks or clowns.  You got a better idea?  Heads.  Yes! Whew!  Right. Ok, ok, uh, ducks is heads, because ducks have heads.  Yes! There\\'s still pie.  Oh, yeah, he rode the bus today.  Morning!  Pretty good.  Okay, really good. Anyway I gotta go; I’m late for work.  Yeah—Hey, don’t worry, she’s a terrific girl. And hey listen, could you do me a favor? When she comes out could you just mention that I’m not looking for a serious relationship; that’d be great.  Just casually slip it in, y’know lay the groundwork. Tell her uh, I’m a loner—No! An outlaw! Tell her she doesn’t want to get mixed up with the likes of me.  Hey, I’m gonna call her later! Honest! Oh come on, Chandler used to do it! He’d even make the girl pancakes! Plus, he’d make extras and leave ‘em for me.  Hey! What’s up?  Erin! Still here!  Why wouldn’t ya? Erin is great! Then-then there’s you guys.  Yeah. I’ll uh, I’ll call ya.  Bye-bye.  So, system kinda broke down huh?!  What?!!  No idea? Who do you think brought her here?  Man, do you know what guys want!  My beers?! Look you guys, she’s a very nice girl. Okay? We had a good time, but I just—I don’t see it going anywhere.  Look I’m sorry you guys, I-I just don’t think so.  Now hold on a second, fifth floor against that back wall?  All right, so we should go catch our movie.  Hey!  Erin.  Who’s birthday party?  Hey.  Oh, unbelievable! We had the best time!  No! No! No! You guys were totally right! This is so much better than the first time we went out. Y’know? That was so awkward, we were really nervous.  Yeah that really calms me down. And! We have so much in common! She loves sandwiches, sports, although she is a Met fan, not much of an issue now but if were ever to have kids, well that’s a…  Okay.  How can you say that?! The Mets have no closer!  What about Game 1 of the Series?  Okay. See you guys later.  Hey!  Oh, it was great! I mean we walked all around the village. We went to this ice cream place, split a milkshake, 70/30 but still… And guess what, I’m thinking about taking her upstate to one of those bed and breakfasts.  No-no-no-no-no! It’s a surprise, but it’s gonna be tricky thought because she said she was gonna be pretty busy at work for a while.  Where are you gettin’ this?  Oh. Oh.  No! No. Don’t do that, just next time make sure she really likes me.  Yeah?  Question. Was ah, ‘Egg the Gellers!’ the war cry of your neighbourhood?  Booo!!  Guess what?  I got a gig!  Well, it’s not a part, no. I’m teaching acting for soap operas down at the Learning Extension.  Yeah, yeah. It’s like my chance to give something back to the acting community.  Hi!  Oh it was great. Yeah, you get to say stuff like, ’Hey, the bell doesn’t dismiss you, I dismiss you.’  Oh, and guess what, I got an audition for All My Children.  Yeah, it’s this great part, this boxer named Nick. And I’m so, so right for it, y\\'know, he’s just like me. Except he’s a boxer, and has an evil twin.  Hey, Monica bought a bed from the Mattress King?  You want me to lie to Chandler?  No.  Hey, you’re ah, pretty good at this.  Ahh!  Hey now!  Hey!!! Oww!! And I’m bleeding.  Okay, great.  Okay.  All right. I can’t see.  Hey-hey.  Awww, one of my students got an audition. I’m so proud.  You bet! What’s the part?  Whoa. That was really good.  Well, I-I might’ve said supergay.  Because, Monica, the guy’s so good, and I really, really want this part.  All right, Jester man, look we wanna see the king.  What? What’s going on?  Oh my God! Is that why you guys had to get married?!  I can’t! I-I don’t have any other clothes here.  I’m sorry! Okay? I went down to the gift shop and it’s either this or a bathrobe! Look, what’s more important, the way I’m dressed or me being with you on your special day?  I don’t believe we’ve met, Joey Tribbiani.  Wow, I’ve admired your work for years. You-you’ve done some really amazing stuff.  Wow Dennis Phillips! That’s great! How did you guys meet?  Chandler. Will you see if your mom can give my resume to Dennis Phillips? ‘Cause if I can get in a Broadway show then I would’ve done it all, film, television, and theater. The only think left would be radio, and that’s just for ugly people.  Uh, eleven, eleven and a half.  Uh, I don’t even really know where I left those. Sorry.  Okay fine! I’m a seven! All right, I have surprisingly small feet. But the rest of me is good, I’ll show ya!  Hey! Did you talk to Dennis about me yet?  No-no! No! No! You don’t tell a Broadway guy that! Now he just thinks I’m a soap actor.  Hey!  So did you uh, happen to catch my toast up there?  Well, I’d like to think there was something for everyone. Look, I know you’re casting for this new show…  Oh, see that’s where you’re wrong. Whatever it is I can do it. And if didn’t see it up there, just-just try me.  Shh. Shh. Don’t try to talk, we’ll get you up to your room, we’ll soak your feet, you’ll be okay.  Yeah.  Tell me about it, I feel like I’m holding down the fort all by myself.  Yeah.  Oh, you have no idea. And-and when we’re on stage I get to-to kiss her and-and touch her, but then she goes home with the director, and it’s like somebody’s ripping out my heart!  Uh, Pheebs, you had a barrel for a dollhouse?  Hey, Kate!  Listen, I ah, went to that restaurant that you were talking about last week...  Oh, hey! Joey Tribbiani.  Get out of here, really?!  Yeah?  They gave me the shaft all right.  All right.  Come on baby, don’t go. Please? What do you say?  Hey, I’m not interested in her sweater! It’s what’s underneath her sweater that counts. And besides, since ah, since when do you care who I’m going out with?  Do you want me to want you to care?  What?  Come on baby, don’t go. Please? What do you say?  Hey, it’s gonna be all right.  What?  Oh, yeah, with the mug painting. Yeah. I was so listening to that. But ah, y\\'know what, I think I kinda need to work on my stuff tonight.  Okay.  I don’t know.  How do you mean?  Maybe he could slip her the tongue.  Yeah, yeah, and then Adrian, she maybe she could wrap her legs around his waist.  And then, then he could use his teeth, his teeth to undo her dress, and, and, and bite her!  Something like that?  Yeah.  Hey.  No-no, things ah, finally happened with Kate.  Hey.  So I ah, talked to Lauren, kinda told her how things were with us. Did you ah, did you talk to Marshall?  Y\\'know, about what happened with us.  What are you talking about? It was a big deal. I mean, come on you can’t tell me last night didn’t mean something to you. I-I was there, you’re not that good an actress.  Nooo.  Hi, Lauren.  Hey.  Seriously, you like it? This guy was sellin\\' them on 8th avenue and I looked at \\'em and I though, you know what I don\\'t have?  Fine, make fun. I think it\\'s jaunty.  Hey, I\\'ll be alright. I mean it\\'s not like I\\'m starting from sqare one. I was Dr. Drake Remoray on Days of Our Lives. Heh? I mean that\\'s gotta have some kind of cache.  Chandler gave me word of the day toilet paper. I\\'m gonna get some coffee.  Anybody want a croan.  So, you\\'re not mad at me for getting fired and everything?  No, can we get back to me?  Alright. Cab driver number two?  But I was Dr. Drake Remoray. How can I go from bein\\' a neurosurgeon to drivin\\' a cab?  But this is a two line part, it\\'s like takin\\' a step backwards. I\\'m not gonna do this.  I\\'m sorry. See ya.  What is it?  See, this is why I don\\'t date women who read. Uh-oh.  It\\'s my VISA bill. Envelope one of two. That can\\'t be good.  Oh my God.  Look at this, how did I spend so much money?  Ahh.  My animals. Hey the guy said they suited me, he spoke with an accent, I was all confused. I don\\'t know what I\\'m gonna do.  What?  That\\'s a two line part.  So what.  Hey, look, I don\\'t need you getting all judgemental and condescending and pedantic.  Yeah.  Well knock it off, you\\'re supposed to be my friend.  Well then tell me things like, \\'Joey you\\'ll be fine,\\' and, \\'Hang in there,\\' and, and, \\'Somethin\\' big\\'s fonna come along, I know it.\\'  Hey Ross, I\\'m aware of what I owe.  Look, I don\\'t wanna hear this right now.  Well don\\'t just say.  Ok.  I don\\'t need to think about it. I was Dr. Drake Remoray. That was huge. Big things are gonna happen, you\\'ll see. Ross, you still there?  Hey Gunther, let me get a lemonade to go.  Ah, it\\'s career stuff. I don\\'t know if you heard but they killed off my character on the show.  I fell down an elevator shaft.  What?  All the way to the airport huh? You know that\\'s over 30 miles, that\\'s gonna cost you about so bucks.  What?  Ohh, you know what it is? It\\'s smudgy \\'cause they\\'re fax pages. Now when I was on Days of Our Lives as Dr. Drake Remoray, they\\'d send over the whole script on real paper and everything.  And, and just so you know, if you wanted to expand this scene like, like have the cab crash or somethin\\', I could attend to the victims \\'cause I have a background in medical acting.  Oh hey uh, be careful with that 3-D last supper, Judas is a little loose.  They\\'re takin all my stuff back. I guess you were right.  Thanks Ross.  I went.  I didn\\'t get it.  What?  Huh?  I can\\'t watch this.  Uhhh, I was an impulse buyer, near the register.  Thanks Ross. I really like that bird though...I\\'ll take the dog though.  Hello.  I know I would.  Hey no problem.  Na, na I\\'m ok. Oh and uh, just so you know, I\\'m not movin\\' back in \\'cause I have to. Well, I mean, I do have to. It\\'s just that that place wasn\\'t really, I mean, this is...  A little foos?  What happened to the foosball?  He paid a lot of money for it.  Well, I had a whole ceramic zoo thing goin\\' over there but now, without the other ones, it just looks tacky.  Not me.  Twice?  You guys okay?  What?  No, it\\'s the pre-game. I\\'m gonna watch it at the reception.  Seventeen-fourteen Giants... three minutes to go in the third.  Ooh, look-look-look-look-look! I got Monica naked!  Hey, wouldn\\'t be cool if our duck and chick had a little baby? We could call it Chuck.  No, it\\'s too wrinkly to be a mole.  Yeah, right.  So Pheebs, do they know about each other?  Hey.  Well what is it?!  Oh! Maybe they\\'ll name yours after you! Y\\'know, they\\'ll call it, The Ross. And then people would be like, \"Awww, he\\'s got a Ross.\"  Whoa, that doesn\\'t necessarily mean that he\\'s breaking up with you.  Yeah, maybe he just cheated on you.  Or ha-ha, we could go over there and pee on them.  Whoa-whoa-whoa. What ah, what happened to playing the field?  Okay, good, so there you go. Go with Vince.  Oh sure, go with the sissy.  Oh no-no-no-no, I meant Chandler.  Whoa! For a rich guy he\\'s got, that\\'s a pretty small TV.  Look at this! A millionaire\\'s checkbook.  Hi, how ya doing?  Yeah, yeah. He’s got a, he’s got a really bad cough, and our vet, he can’t do anything about it. Is there something you can do?  Ooh. I-I don\\'t know Chan. I\\'m not so good with remembering lines.  Seriously? She actually said that?  Nooooo! Being funny is your thing!  Without that, you just got \"lame with women\".  Hey!  That\\'s like a woman wanting to be a...  Really? Do you not know Chandler?  Heeeyy! Hey!  Yeah....  Not knowing when to shut up...  Yeah! Allright! Hey, hey Ross. Check it out! Sandy taught me Hot-cross Buns.  Me! I\\'m up for puppets!  Allright. See you later!  Wow! You blow my mind...  Aaahh... How much do I owe you?  It\\'s like the cheapest college ever.  Man this is weird. You ever realize Captain Crunch\\'s eyebrows are actually on his hat?  What?  Yeah, so.  Well, that was only \\'cause I used the red one to unclog the drain.  Hey, why can\\'t we use the same toothbrush, but we can use the same soap?  Alright, well next time you take a shower, think about the last thing I wash and the first thing you wash.  Hey.  Well, you know that guy that\\'s on my show that\\'s in a coma? He\\'s havin\\' a brunch.  Wow, this is wild. What\\'re you gonna get?  So where you gettin\\' it?  Oh, is today the day you\\'re gonna tell them about you two?  Can you believe this place?  Ah, I was just in the bathroom, and there\\'s mirrors on both sides of you. So when you\\'re in there it\\'s like you\\'re peein\\' with the Rockettes.  Hey! We were just sayin\\', great apartment man.  Huh?  Yeah, can you see me in a place like this?  Can we drop this? I am not interested in the guy\\'s apartment.  Why would I want another apartment, huh? I\\'ve already got an apartment that I love.  Alright, you want the truth? I\\'m thinkin\\' about it.  I\\'m sorry. I\\'m 28 years old, I\\'ve never lived alone, and I\\'m finally at a place where I\\'ve got enough money that I don\\'t need a roommate anymore.  What\\'re you gettin\\' so bent out of shape for, huh? It\\'s not like we agreed to live together forever. We\\'re not Bert and Ernie.  Well that\\'s how I feel.  Well then maybe I will.  Great. Then you\\'ll be able to spend more quality time with your real friends, the spoons.  Hey.  Hey listen, I\\'m sorry about what happened. . .  I know. Yeah.  No, we\\'re alright.  Plastic spoons. Great.  These\\'ll go great in my new place. You know, \\'till I get real ones.  Well, I can\\'t use these forever. I mean, let\\'s face it, they\\'re no friend to the environment.  I\\'m movin\\' out like we talked about.  Well, it was a fight. . . based on serious stuff, remember. About how I never lived alone or anything. I just think it would be good for me, ya know, help me to grow or. . . whatever.  Hey, are you cool with this. I mean, I don\\'t want to leave you high and dry.  Woah. Why do you get to keep the table?  Yeah. And uh, I paid for the other half.  Alright, you\\'re on. I can take two minutes out of my day to kick your ass.  Woah, woah, woah, woah. Which sister?  Get out of the corner. Pass it, pass it.  Yes! And the table is mine.  Hey, you guys are still gonna come visit me, right?  Oh no-no, it\\'s uh, it\\'s not what you think. We uh, we used it to, you know, fling water balloons off the roof. Remember that, those junior high kids couldn\\'t even get theirs accross the street.  Naa, you keep it, you need the practice.  So, I guess this is it.  Listen, uh, I don\\'t know when I\\'m gonna see you again.  Right, yeah. OK. Um, take care.  What are you doing?  Why are you doing this?  Dude, you just described seven days worth of stuff. You’ve got to spread it out a little, you know. Haven’t you ever been unemployed?  But, I love you.  So Pheebs, where are you doing all, your bell ringing?  How could I not get the part? The play was about a 29-year-old Italian actor from Queens.  She’s a woman!  That part was perfect for me! I can\\'t believe I didn\\'t get it!  Come on Ross be realistic, y\\'know? If I did write something, what are the chances I could get those guys to star in it?  Wait a second, I could star in it!  I can\\'t write! Y\\'know I mean I-I-I\\'m an actor, I don\\'t have the discipline that takes, y\\'know? I can\\'t do it.  Really? You\\'d-you\\'d do that for me?!  Thanks!  Done!  It\\'s not.  Hey, how do you spell suspicious?  Because I think this character is going to be suspicious about stuff.  You\\'re driving me crazy with that!  Don’t stop! Move the bowl further away! Ross could make that shot!  Well, you suck! But at least you suck at a man\\'s game now.  Chandler, I can\\'t be playing games, Ross is gonna be home soon. And I have to write five whole pages if I\\'m gonna stick to his schedule.  All right, all we need is a little lighter fluid.  Yeah, I think we said good-bye to that when we invented hammer darts.  Yeah, that\\'s the uh, game we were playing.  You\\'re right, you\\'re right, I\\'ll get back to work.  Hey!  Yesterday\\'s pages did not reflect my best work.  Dude, if you think Fireball\\'s relaxing, you\\'ve obviously have never played.  Come on look guys, don\\'t fight.  Hey-hey guys, hey! How about we settle this over a friendly game of Fireball? Huh? I\\'ll go unhook the smoke detectors!  Oh, y\\'know the same thing happened to me one time.  Don\\'t you remember when we were jogging in the park and we saw that really pretty bird and wanted to take a picture—I didn\\'t have my camera!  Yeah, wow, sorry Rach.  They\\'re brother and sister!!!  No dude, Ross tore up the tickets!  Yeah, well, that\\'s fine, but the important thing is that I finished it. And uh, I think it\\'s really good, but y\\'know it\\'d really help me is if I could hear it. So would you guys read it for me?  Oh no! No-no, keep reading! The good part\\'s coming up. Keep going.  What?! Wait-wait-wait! The handsome man was about to enter!!  Morning, roomie!  Fifth day\\'s a charm.  Hey, it\\'s great having you back. You know, stay as long as you want, and when does she stop crying all night?  She\\'s probably exhausted from all that adorable screaming she did last night.  No, hey, it\\'s been great.  Yeah. And look, I just want you to know that with Rachel staying here and everything, all my feelings from before are totally over, okay? And even if they weren\\'t, when you accidentally walk in on a woman using a breast pump...  Wow! So, how are you?  Really?  Well, actually it...  Wow, really?  Sure, I know lots of girls.  Ooh, names?  Hey. I was just gonna get something to eat. You want something?  I\\'m fine, I\\'m fine, it\\'s just, it\\'s just weird what\\'s happening with her and Ross. You know, yesterday he asked me to fix him up with somebody.  Why are they doing this?  You know what\\'s crazy? These jars. What is it, like two bites in here?  I know, I know. And when they moved back in together, I figured y\\'know, that\\'s where things were headed.  Yes, and they should name one of their kids Joey. I may not have kids; someone\\'s gotta carry on the family name.  Yeah, because it is slim pickings. I had this date last night: Yuck! But we should probably keep it down; she\\'s still in the bedroom.  I know; that just pushes them further and further apart.  Ooh, that\\'s a great plan!  Shhh! Not so loud, we don\\'t wanna wake up, uh...  Hey.  All right! Who is he?  She\\'s this really boring woman. She\\'s a teacher!  Yeah, yeah, she\\'s really into history and foreign movies... And oh, oh, she loves puzzles. Huh? Come on, who loves puzzles?  Oh my god, you\\'re right!  She even reads for pleasure!  What? I\\'m not allowed to know smart women?  I met her at the library. I went in to pee.  Well, okay, I\\'ll - I\\'ll just call her and tell her the date\\'s cancelled, and find him somebody else.  Ooh...I hear that\\'s bad.  Yeah, you know, it\\'s not that fun.  Oh, great, pretty soon they\\'ll be back together.  Hello?  Emma? Hey! Hi!  How are ya? How are ya? Where are your babysitters, huh? Why\\'s the bedroom door closed?  You can\\'t have S-E-X, when you\\'re taking care of the B-A-B-I-E!  Because you two were having sex!  Hey! It is unacceptable that you two would have sex with Emma in the next room. I\\'m gonna have to tell Rachel about this.  Hey, I gotta! Unless...  Unless you name your firstborn child Joey.  Hey, I may never have kids, and somebody\\'s gotta carry on my family name.  Uh-huh.  It\\'s easy, you just walk in on them having sex.  We\\'re geniuses! Yeah, look at them, look at them, they\\'re really bonding.  Where?  Can you believe they\\'re still not here?  I know, I\\'m so bummed. Can we have our free crab cakes now?  Look, my agent hooked me up with six tickets to a great play.  It\\'s a one-woman play called \"Why don\\'t you like me: a bitter woman\\'s journey through life\".  You guys are gonna have a great time, I promise!  I wish I could but I just found out that I have to be at work really early the next day, so I can\\'t go, but, you know, take the extra ticket and invite whoever you want.  What\\'s happenin\\'?  Oh, I\\'d love to, but I gotta get up so early the next day and so, you know me, work comes first  Kinda have a... a thing for the Days Of Our Life\\'s people.  I do it every year.  I didn\\'t have to tell you that!! I\\'m stupider than Jane Rogers!!  Yeah...  Yeah...  You\\'re fine, ok? But everyone else acts like an idiot around famous people!  Ok, ok! Fine! You can come, but don\\'t tell anybody else. It\\'s up on the roof at 8.  What party?  Hey, that\\'s why I didn\\'t invite you. you have to calm down, alright... go, go get yourself a drink or something...  It\\'s a science.  Hey Ross, listen, Dirk was wondering about the woman that you brought and if you guys were together, or...  Monica!  Nothing major, it\\'s just that, you know, they\\'re not really good enough for you, and you deserve the best.  That\\'s true. But you know what, it doesn\\'t matter because I already know who you\\'re gonna go home with tonight.  Me.  Yes, \\'cause we live together, that\\'s a joke!  Gotcha.  Uh, hey.  So he can\\'t come?  Seriously?  I am pretty wisdomous.  Oh no, no, no, let your dad get this.  Hey, you\\'re Mike\\'s parents, right?  Ah, our little ones are growing up fast, uh?  You know, on the one hand you\\'re happy for them, but on the other hand it\\'s hard to let go.  Hey, I\\'m not that fond of you either, ok buddy? But I\\'m just trying to be nice for the kids!  So, you know I\\'m filling in for Phoebe\\'s step dad, tomorrow, right?  Strike two!  Strike three! You only get one more, Mike!  Oh, man! I wouldn\\'t have had breakfast if I knew there was going to be corsages!  May I have a word with you, please?  More back talk. And yes, I may be borrowing a few lines from my recent unsuccessful audition for \"Family Honor 2: Thissa Time Itsa Personal.\"  I want you to take this seriously! Phoebe is very very important to me, ok? And I wanna make sure that you are gonna take care of her.  I\\'m glad we had this little talk.  Hey, what are you guys gonna do?  I don\\'t think they are.  Yeah according to the news, most of the city did.  Uh, for your information, since they hired a very hot weather girl.  Oh hey, don\\'t worry. I\\'m still ordained from your wedding.  Yeah, you\\'d think I\\'d give up being a minister and start paying to ride the subway? Huhuh...  I had to read the Bible pretty carefully, but... yeah we do.  Friends, family, dog... Thank you all for being here to witness this blessed event. The cold has now spread to my special place... so I\\'m gonna do the short version of this. Phoebe and Mike are perfect for each other. And I know I speak for every one here... when I wish them a lifetime of happiness. Who has the rings?  Yeah?  Oh, okay. Phoebe, do you take this man to be your husband?  Mike, do you take this woman to be your wife?  I now pronounce you... husband and wife.  It was, yeah. I kind of don\\'t want it to end. Hey, you wanna come in for a drink and a bite of corsage?  Nice. Oh hey, what about Ross?  Exellent dream score.  I don\\'t know. What are you wearing?  Hey, hey, Chan. She could work for you.  What the hell does a paleontologist need a beeper for?  How young is young Ethan? Young?  Would you let it go Ross. It was just a dream. It doesn\\'t mean...  All right, relax, relax. Just relax, just relax. Be cool, be cool.  Hey, hey. How was the first day?  Oh... Yeah, you do.  So, tell me. Was it like you and Chandler, and then you and me, or you and me and Chandler?  What?  Listen, the next time you talk to him, can you ask him which one the strongest Power Ranger is?  Stegosaurus!  What about Andr�?  They\\'re here already?  Uh, moist, yeah.  For the ride.  All right, I\\'m going. I\\'m going.  Hey!  No. Y\\'know how we’re always saying we need a place for the mail.  Well, I started building one. But then I decided to take it to the next step.  No, an entertainment unit, with a mail cubby built right in. It’s a one day job, max.  Oh yeah. These are my old work pants, Sergio Valente’s.  Power saw kinda got away from me there.  Her what?  Hey, Monica, who would yours be?  Hey-hey!  I know.  Oh, I’m sorry. Did I get ‘ya?  Calm down, do you want this unit or not?  Well, you should’ve told me that before, I’m not a mind reader. Hey, we’re out of beer. I’m going to Monica’s.  Oh Monica, listen, I ah, I saw down at the hardware store, they got those designer tiles on sale. If you ever want to redo the bathroom floor.  Nothing. It’s just old and dingy, that’s all.  Eh! There you go.  Ooh, very official.  Why don’t we just go on two.  Because it’s faster.  All right, but in the future...  So we are going on two?  Wow, it’s big!  Maybe, my ruler’s wrong.  Look it’s not that bad. So what, it blocks a little of your door, a little of my door.  Yeah, listen, before I forget that side is still wet.  Y\\'know what?  Get out your checkbook, mister.  You are dogged man! I totally fit!  Hey.  Hey, how much did you guys tip the super this year?  You gave him cookies?  Oh my God.  Uhhh, I don\\'t think you\\'re gonna like this.  I can\\'t believe it\\'s Christmas already. Ya know, I mean, one day your eatin\\' turkey, the next thing ya know, your lords are a-leapin\\' and you geese are a-layin\\'.  C\\'mon show us what you bought. . . You know you want to.  So anyway, I\\'m trying to get my boss\\'s ex-wife to sleep with me. . .  Oh, but when Phoebe has a problem, everyone\\'s all ears!  Yeah, I know exactly what she\\'s goin\\' through.  She told us.  Monica, pigeons learn faster that you.  Phoebe here with the cab yet?  Well she better get here soon, the outlet stores close at 7.  Hey, here she comes.  Hey.  Hey.  Yeah, big stuff.  Sure is.  Good luck Phoebs.  How far\\'d ya get?  Phoebs, what\\'s goin\\' on?  Well, maybe he\\'s, maybe he\\'s this really cool pharmacist guy.  Phoebs, that\\'s OK. You took a big step today.  Yeah, and when you do, he\\'ll be lucky to have you.  Uh, listen Phoebs, I know you\\'re not goin\\' in there but do you think it\\'d be alright if I went in and used his bathroom? Oh, that\\'s fine, never mind. Cool, snow, kinda like a blank canvas.  Really, hey, you mind if I turn the heat down?  Hey, Monica, the knob was broken so I just turned it off from underneath, I hope that\\'s alright.  Rach, these are for you.  No, but with this new car smell, you\\'ll think you do.  Uh-huh.  And for Ross, Mr. Sweet-tooth.  They\\'re ribbed for your pleasure.  Hey.� How come you\\'re answering your own phone?� Where\\'s your crazy assistant?  Okay, what have we always wanted to do together?  No, no, no.� When you get home tomorrow night, you and I are going to be at the Wizzards-Knicks game . . .� courtside!  Yeah.� Maybe Michael Jordon will dive for the ball and break my jaw with his knee.  Hey!� How come the door\\'s locked?  Oh, I thought I heard a man\\'s voice before.  Dude, come home!  COME . . .� HOME.  I don\\'t know how to tell you this but, uh . . . I think Monica\\'s cheatin\\' on ya.� I told you shouldn\\'t have married someone so much hotter than you.  I heard him again!  Okay.� Great.� I\\'ll see you when you get here.� I\\'m gonna wait out in the hall in case the dude comes out.  Absolutely.� You\\'d do it for me.� Not that you ever have to because I know how to keep my women satisfied.  Wow!� That didn\\'t take long.� I thought you said Tulsa was, like a three hour flight.  I guess not.  Yeah, right Monica.� I\\'m so sorry.  What\\'s going on?  All right.  Thanks man.  Where are you going?  Hey Ross, is uh, is Staten Island really an island?  Ohhh. I thought it was like Long Island.  Hey, what time is it?  Wow! You realize that we\\'ve been throwing this ball, without dropping it, for like an hour?  Yeah. I realized it about a half-hour ago but I didn\\'t want to say anything \\'cause I didn\\'t want to jinx it.  Hey!  What the hell is that?!!  That, is not a cat! {I have to agree with Joey on this one.}  It\\'s not a cat!  It\\'s not a cat!  Uhh, the ball thing.  Hey Ross, wouldn\\'t it be great if we could go two straight hours without dropping it?!  Okay!  I have to pee. And Rachel\\'s in the bathroom!  Man, I didn\\'t think we were gonna make it!  Maybe this should be more of a quiet game.  Hi!  I don\\'t know.  Oh, I don\\'t know…. Yeah, can\\'t do it.  Oh, don\\'t worry, it\\'s not a cat.  That\\'s right baby.  Oh yeah, that\\'s right!  Whoa-whoa you guys, it\\'s not a cat!  Did you get your money back?  Man that was great! Huh? Can you believe how long we threw that ball around?  Okay, pick a card.  I\\'m always on the swings! What am I doing wrong?!  Luck!  Whoa-whoa, but her birthday isn\\'t like for another month.  Ross!! We\\'re having a surprise party for Rachel!!  Done.  They\\'re gonna do it together.  What, so I gotta shut it down now?  Whoa-whoa dad? There\\'s a dad in the commercial?  Whoa, hey, maybe I\\'ll go down there with ya and see if I can get an audition to play the dad. I mean who better to play Ben\\'s father than his godfather.  What?! Are you kidding?!  All right!  Hey! I\\'m in, they\\'re gonna let me audition!  I know! I know! It turns out that one of the casting ladies has actually seen me in a play, so I steered clear of her…  Oh yeah, yeah! He\\'s done tons of commercials. I\\'ve seen him in like Sugar Smacks, Playstation, and that one for the phone company. In fact he was so good in that one, he actually convinced me to switch phone companies. Chandler was mad….  That\\'s great. Listen, wouldn\\'t it be great though if I got to play Ben\\'s dad?  Well, unfortunately, I don\\'t get many callbacks so…  Who knows?  Oh this is great! I might actually get to play Ben\\'s dad!  Man, this is gonna be kinda weird.  Ross good, I\\'m uh glad you\\'re here. I wanna talk to you about something.  Well, I\\'ve been thinking about this whole commercial thing, y\\'know me going up against Ben, the two of us competing, and that can\\'t lead to anything good. So, I think I\\'m just gonna step aside. I\\'m gonna tell them that I won\\'t audition.  That\\'s it? You\\'re-you\\'re gonna let me do this?! This-this is my career we\\'re talking about here!  I just said that so you wouldn\\'t let Ben do it! Look Ross, if anyone should step aside it should be Ben!  What? Chandler! Tell \\'em!  At least I care about his feelings!  Do you know how hard this is gonna be on him when he doesn’t get it?  Oh, come on! Have you seen what my kid can do?! Huh?! I mean he dials phones! He-he-he eats tortilla chips! He-he plays soccer with the cartoon tiger!  You just give him a spoon baby!  Yeah! Because this commercial belongs to me and Mitch!  Yeah?! So\\'s yours!  Oh yeah, no problem.  Hi!  Uh-oh.  Well this is noodle soup and uh, I\\'ve been working with tomato. But that\\'s okay, no problem. No problem. Hmm, noodle soup.  Oh, what did I say?  Hmm, noodle soup.  Okay.  Hey.  What you do mean?  Wait-whoa-whoa, you lost me.  No, it\\'s just ah, I care so damn much about little Ben that uh, it was more important to see him succeed.  Thank you! So, did-did he get it?  Eh, what are you gonna do?  I think I know that girl.  Oh yeah, I definitely know her.  Really. And what do you mean you never have fun anymore? You have fun with me, remember that time we saw those strippers and you paid me 50 bucks to eat that book?  Well, why do you call him Gandolf?  No, I had sex in high school.  Will you calm down, he’s just a human guy.  Really?!  All right, I’ll see you guys.  I have an audition, but I’ll definitely hook up with you later. Where are you gonna be around noon?  Hey! What are you guys doing here? I thought you’d be out partying with Gandel-worf.  So you’ve been sittin’ around here all mornin’?  So what if he didn’t come! We can still go out and party ourselves!  Well, we could do that!  We’ll do it all, and better! Look, after tonight, Gandolf will want to party with us, dude! Come on!  Yeah!  Yeah!!  Yeah! All right? Let’s go!  All right, so we’ll get a little coffee, and get energized, and we’ll head back out.  So, we’re having fun, right?  We don’t need that wizard guy. We hit a couple of clubs, talked to some strangers, and uh, after this, we’ll head down to the docks and see about that boat thing.  Are you serious?!  Thank God! I’m exhausted!  Yeah, but uh, I don’t want to be up too late, so uh, I’ll have a decaf.  I can’t hear a word you’re saying, my ears are ringing so bad.  Yeah, I know.  Yeah! And I like to hang out in a quiet place where I can talk to my friends.  We’re 29, we’re not women.  Yeah you are baby.  No. They really like me over there. They want to do a big profile on me, but I said no.  Remember what happened the last time I did an interview for them? I said I write a lot of my own lines, and then the writers got mad and made my character fall down the elevator shaft. So who knows what I might say this time.  Fine! All right, I’ll do it. But hey! You guys have to be at the next table so you can stop me if I y’know, start to say something stupid.  Yeah.  Oh, not at all. Happy to do it.  And I’ll have all the muffins.  Thank you. Wait-wait-wait-wait, you see me again. Hang on, the guy\\'s butt\\'s blockin\\' me. There I am, there I am, there I am, there I am, there I am…  Well, there are so many things, it’s hard to pick just one.  Dude, stop talking crazy and make us some tea!  I think you’re right.  One.  That’s kinda nice.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah!!  Right.  Matter of fact, I do.  Uh, we stars just try to eat right and get lots of exercise.  Wow! You realize that we\\'ve been throwing this ball, without dropping it, for like an hour?  Yeah. I realized it about a half-hour ago but I didn\\'t want to say anything \\'cause I didn\\'t want to jinx it.  Yeah!  Nothing! Well, I-I got this blinding pain in my stomach when I was lifting weights before, then I uh passed out and uh, haven’t been able to stand up since. But um, I don’t think it’s anything serious.  I like it.  What’s not to like? Custard? Good. Jam? Good. Meat? Goooooood.  The fridge broke. I have to eat everything. Cold cuts, ice cream, limes—Hey, what was in that brown jar?  Not anymore.  Uhh, I don’t believe in these crazy diets y’know, just everything in moderation.  It was so stupid, I said some stuff in an interview that I shouldn’t have said. But believe me, that’s not gonna happen today.  You guys, this is Shelley, she’s interviewing me for Soap Opera Digest, and Shelley, this are my friends…  Okay.  No thanks.  How come you have two?  Get out.  Wow, is this friendship? I think so. Check it out, we\\'re bracelet buddies.  No that’s all right. Don’t worry about it.  Rach! Hey! It’s fine! You’re at Joey’s!  I know.  Wow, you are a good friend, \\'course the audition was this morning, and I didn\\'t get it. But that was a hell of a kiss. Rachel is a very lucky girl.  Judge rules, no violation.  And the duck gets the Nutter-Butter!  Judge rules, Nutter-Butter.  Yeah.  I’d seen this thing on The Discovery Channel...  That’s right I stepped up! She’s my friend and she needed help! And if I had too, I’d pee on anyone of you!  Umm, no. No best friend, no. Just a lot of close friends.  Really? Me? Wow! I don’t even know any huge gay people!  What? Are you referring to my man\\'s bag? At first, I thought it just looked good, but it\\'s practical too. Check it out! It\\'s got compartments for all your stuff! Your wallet! Your keys! Your address book!  I think face to face.  Face to face, yeah!  All right.  Y’know, when we talked about face to face, I don’t think we thought it all the way through.  No I’m not. Why would you say that? That’s just mean.  It’s not what you said. It’s the way you said it… Oh My God, I’m a woman!!!  Great nap.  Oh-oh-oh-oh, how I do it is, I look a woman up and down and say, \"Hey, how you doin’?\"  Hey! How you doin’?  Oh! I see what happened. It\\'s because I was trying to repel you. Right? Believe me, you\\'d feel a lot different if I turned it on.  What?!?! Oh dear God!  Not much to tell there I’m really shy.  Oh, I don’t watch soap operas. Excuse me, I have a life, y’know?  Yeah, I called the lady about that. I told her I was just joking. She was pretty nice about that.  Little bit, yeah.  Hey, you’re the one that loves the picture.  Look, just because I know about you two, doesn\\'t mean I like looking at it.  I can still hear you!  Hey!  Hey, Ross, you\\'re okay with that?  No! Everything\\'s gettin\\' all messed up, y\\'know? Emily won\\'t let Ross see Rachel, we\\'re not gonna stop seeing Rachel, hence Ross stops seeing us!  No! But y\\'know, I\\'m an actor, I\\'ll act cool.  I\\'ll take it!  What\\'s the matter Ross?  Uhh, like dark hair, bushy beard?  Yeah, you fogged Danny.  Dan just moved in downstairs. Yeah, he just got back from like this four-month trek in the Andes. Nice fella.  Uhh, are you saying that you\\'re not entirely happy about this?  You do have a choice!! Ross, why are you listening to her?! Are you, are you crazy?!  We all hate Emily!  Yeah!  Yes! Yes! Unreasonable!  I kinda feel like it\\'s my fault.  Look, Ross, I feel really bad. I mean, you\\'re going through all this stuff and I just acted like a jerk.  Look, we were way out of line, we totally support you.  Hey, y\\'know Ross, I think I kinda understand why I kinda lost it today.  RACHEL PLEASE!!! JUST HAVE DINNER WITH US!!!  All right, I-I\\'m sorry. I\\'m sorry. You see Rach I\\'m an actor…  It\\'s almost as if he knew.  Well uh, I don\\'t know about who\\'s here, but I can tell you for damn sure who\\'s not here and that\\'s Rachel!!  I think it\\'s going okay. Looks like he\\'s smiling.  What happened? What happened?  Oh! Hey Rach, listen umm…  I got a big date coming up, do you know a good restaurant?  Ooh, great! Thanks!  You sure are naming a lot of ways to postpone sex, I’ll tell ya…  Hey, y’know what?  Why don’t I take you out?  Yes I do! And we’re gonna go out, we’re gonna have a good time, and take your mind off of childbirth and c-sections and-and giant baby heads stretching out…  I’ll be fun.  Hey come on now, this is a real date. Uh, so…nice place you got here. Foosball, huh? Pizza box. Oh, a subscription to Playboy, my kind of woman.  I would like to meet him. He sounds like a stand up guy.  Ah… Hey, so this roommate of yours…is he good looking?  Oh yeah, it must be tough to keep your hands of him, huh?  No-no-no-no, he’s not! No! Why are you trying to ruin the game? Come on!  Oh whoa-whoa-whoa, no roommate stuff. Okay? We’re on a date.  Oh alright. Umm, well, okay, I usually start by having a bottle of wine sent to my table from a fan.  Well it does when you combine it with, \"This is so embarrassing, I just want to have a normal life!\"  Oh okay, how about this one. I was gonna wait until the end of the night to kiss you, but you’re so beautiful…I don’t think I can.  Alright, so…so tell me one of your moves.  That’s your move? Boy Rach, you’re lucky you’re hot.  Yeah, with my mom. Yeah, not so much with my dad.  I don’t know. I guess there’s just always been this distance y’know—I mean we both try to pretend it’s not there, but it is.  Yeah, it is. It’s really tough. Y’know sometimes I think—Wow!! Nice move!  \"Where’d you grow up,\" it’s so simple!  Yeah.  Yes I am! Again so simple!  Oh come on! Just pick one! Between Monica, Phoebe, Chandler, and Ross if you had to, if you had to, who would you punch?  Chandler?  Me too! Hey Rach, can I just say I think this is the best date I ever had!  I never laughed so hard—Did you see the wine come out of my nose?  I gotta say, I never knew I could enjoy the non-sex part of the date so much.  Huh. Huh.  Ah, well, if I want the girl to kiss me, first thing I do is make my lips look irresistible.  Now you can’t tell anyone, but uh…I put on shiny lip balm.  Yeah, like a moth to a flame, I’m telling ya. Okay all right, so now you go.  Why not?  Hey!  Oh yeah, I still can’t believe you haven’t seen Cujo. What is wrong with you?  Have you ever tried to sit through Citizen Kane?  Oh yeah? All right, let’s do it tonight.  Oh right!  Yeah.  Oh my God! You did too? It totally freaked me out, what was that?!  Oh yeah-yeah, the lobster.  Yeah me too, all night.  Yeah well that’s because uh…I stayed in my room. Yeah, you don’t want to look in my hamper.  No-no! I’m fine. It’s just… Hey, can I ask you something? Have you ever looked at someone that you’ve known for a while and then suddenly…suddenly see them a different way?  Yeah. Yeah, that…that’s exactly it. You’re right. Yeah.  Hey, did you get to the part where they’re trapped in the car and Cujo’s throwin’ himself at the windshield?  Oh uh, it didn’t work out.  Oh uh, okay. Yeah.  All right, I know! I know. Yeah, it’ll be okay.  Yeah! Yeah Monica! You listen to me, okay? And I’m not just saying this because I’m your friend, I’m sayin’ it ‘cause it’s the truth. You’re food is abysmal!  I thought you already have a job.  Wow! How do you know how to do that?!  What is it?  You cooked him?  Either eat it, or be in it.  Thata girl! Huh? We should get out of here; there’s a new class comin’ in.  Hi.  When you say used, do you mean eat as a pre-cooking snack?  Cheese makes me thirsty.  All right.  Yeah!  Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa! I don’t want to go. I’m having fun.  Well I had a great time! Learned how to bake, ate great food, that’s the first A I’ve gotten since seventh grade, and I didn’t have to sleep with the teacher this time.  What the hell!  No, thank you.  But no, it\\'s not close. You said it was in escrow? I couldn\\'t even find it on the map.  You know what? You are my friends, I wanna be supportive, I will come with you. SHOTGUN!  What? No, the only reason I\\'m going to their stupid new house, is so I can point out everything that\\'s wrong with it, so they don\\'t move. I\\'m gonna make them stay here.  Hey, hey... I can convince people to do anything, you know. I bet I can even get Mike to do that \"thing\". What is it?  Me too. Yeah, this place is great. I\\'m so happy for you guys. Although, you know, I hope you like fungus.  Fungus! Yeah. Place is full of it.  Okay. Then I guess I have dry eyes and a scratchy throat for no reason.  no... hmmmmm... it\\'s not... hmmmmmmmmmm  Oh, hi, I\\'m Joey. My stupid friends are buying this house. Who are you?  Woah, uh! Okay, let\\'s hear your great idea.  What am I gonna do, I feel like I\\'m losing my friends.  Oh, yeah, sure, easy for you, you\\'re young. Me, I\\'m set in my ways.  Yeah, yeah, I guess.  Oh, just er... you know, looking around. But you know what? This house... is great.  Oh well, the little girl who lives here made me feel a lot better about the whole thing.  That\\'s not funny! You know I\\'m afraid of little girl ghosts!  What? I get my own room?  Why not? I\\'ll keep the tank clean.  I mean, this soap opera is a great gig, but... am I missing opportunities? You know, I\\'ve always thought of myself as a serious actor. I mean, should I be trying to do more independent movies?  Hey bear, I need some career advice.  What is Rock \\'n\\' Roll about that?  Cage closed?  It is me! It\\'s a musical version of Tale of Two Cities. So I think I\\'m gonna sing New York, New York, and ah, oh I left My Heart in San Francisco.  What?  Who?  The what?  Really? Thanks.  Excellent, I\\'ll be there.  Ahhh! My ah, my agent said it wasn\\'t a dancing part.  Hey, everybody lies on their resume, okay. I wasn\\'t one of the Zoom Kids either.  Sure, it looks stupid now, there\\'s no music playing.  Get out! I couldn\\'t stop if a meteor hit me.  Well sure, you name a kid that, what do you expect them to grow up to be?  Whoa, I\\'m not done.  Done.  Mark\\'s a genius!  So, does that mean the audition is off?  What?!  It\\'s ah, step-ity, step and jazz hands.  I know, it was the best I could get out of them.  People, people, people.  Uh-huh. This and a bunch of bubble wrap. And, some of it is not even popped!  Just pickle.  No! No. But ah, try the classifieds, people sell everything in there.  Yeah-well-yeah! Yeah-oh-yeah. Come on in.  He cut off his ear.  I’m out.  Wow! That’s pretty nice. I thought he cut off his ear ‘cause he sucked. What else you got in there?  In the woods. No wait-wait, that’s the joke answer.  Spock’s birth control.  Twelve hundred dollars? You think I have $1200? I’m home in the middle of the day, and I got patio furniture in my living room. I guess there’s a few things you don’t get from book learnin’.  How about zero down and zero a month for a long, long time?  Oh, I-I think I’m gonna stick with the V, I wanna see how this bad boy turns out.  Wh-what’s going on?  No he doesn’t!  Well, it’s good thing you got out when you did, before she blew up like that Vesuvius.  Yeah. And speaking of volcanoes, man are they a violent igneous rock formation.  Oh yeah, lava spewing, hot ash, of course some are dormant.  Well, we can talk about something else. What do you want to talk about? Vivisection? The Vasdeferens? The Vietnam War?  Sure, if you cared enough to call it first.  So, are you ready to go?  I was thinking Chinese food.  I don\\'t know. I mean I like her a lot, and she\\'s really nice, but…  Uhh, look Katie, uh listen, we-we need to talk. Okay? Umm, look I like you. I-I really do, I like you a lot. Okay? But sometimes when you, when you playfully punch me like that it-it feels like someone\\'s hitting me with a very tiny but very real bat.  No-no.  Yeah, big!  Uh-oh, shht! The Misses.  Hey!  Thanks! I\\'ve been working out. Hey listen, is it obvious that I\\'m wearing six sweaters?  Well look, I’m breaking up with Katie so I had to put on some extra padding. Y\\'know? I mean, if she hits me when she\\'s happy, can you imagine how hard she\\'s gonna hit me when I tell her I\\'m taking away the Joey love?  Hey! Hiya!  Huh.  Uhh….  Nah.  What a bad idea!  She\\'s right y\\'know.  Hey Ross, will you pass me that knife?  Oh, it\\'s okay. You don\\'t have to be so mean about it.  That\\'s not funny at all!  Hey!  What\\'s going on?  Hey, is this person who decides whether or not you... get a baby?  Hey, maybe I should stop by! She could be a soap opera fan! It\\'s very impressive when the little people know a celebrity.  Guys? Everything ok? It\\'s me, Joe...  Guys!?  What\\'s going on?  Everything doesn\\'t sound fine!  Well, you wouldn\\'t let me in, so I thought you were in trouble.  But you called me \\'Bert\\'!? That\\'s our code word for danger!  We don\\'t? We really should. From now on, \\'Bert\\' will be our code word for danger.  I forgot my bat.  Uhm... ok... uhm... Well, yeah... You have got some nerve, coming back here. I can\\'t believe you never called me.  Oh... yeah... Probably you don\\'t even remember my name. It\\'s Joey, by the way. And don\\'t bother telling me yours, because I totally remember it... lady. Yeah! I waited weeks for you to call me.  No, no! Don\\'t try to turn this around on me, ok? I\\'m not some kind of... social work, ok, that you can just... do.  Really? Think about it. Come on! You\\'re a beautiful woman, smart, funny, we had a really good time, huh? If I had your number, why wouldn\\'t I call you?  The reactor’s gonna blow in three seconds, we’re never gonna make it!  No! I won’t leave you!  No you’re not! Not to me!  What?  Yeah, you’re great! Okay, let’s take it from…  Yeah, I thought I was pretty good too.  Y’know what? I think that’s enough for now. Yeah. I don’t want to be over rehearsed.  Oh, it’s a new TV show. Yeah. I’m up for the part of Mac Macaveli or \"Mac.\" Yeah, I’m a detective and I solve crimes with the help of my robot partner. He’s a, he’s a Computerized Humanoid Electronically Enhanced Secret Enforcer or-or \"C.H.E.E.S.E.\"  That’s the title! Yeah! Y’know they really lucked out that the initials spell cheese.  Well, don’t get your hopes up, because probably not gonna happen.  I mean come on you guys! My own TV show? I just don’t know if I’m good enough.  You really think so?   Yeah, and oh she\\'s really nice too. She taught me all about how to work the cameras, and smell-the-fart acting.   I play Al Pacino\\'s butt. All right? He goes into the shower, and then- I\\'m his butt.   C\\'mon, you guys. This is a real movie, and Al Pacino\\'s in it, and that\\'s big!  Okay, okay, fine! Make jokes, I don\\'t care! This is a big break for me!  All right well, I’m outta here. Wish me luck.  Terrible! I messed up every line! I shouldn’t even be an actor!  Yeah, did I fool ya?  Oh, it went amazingly well!  Yeah-yeah, it’s down to me and two other guys.  And I know both of them, they’re really good. One of them is the guy from those allergy commercials who’s always getting chased by those big flowers…  I’m just so nervous! Y’know? The callback isn’t until tomorrow at five. I feel like my head is going to explode!  There’s just so much pressure. I mean no offense, but what you guys do is very different. I don’t know if you’d understand.  I want this part so much! Y’know? If I don’t get this part I’m never gonna eat Macaroni and Cheese again!—No, I didn’t say that! That’s a lie.  Yes!! Ha-ha!! All right! Hey! How cool would it be if you could watch like a real life-sized version of this? Huh? I mean how crazy would that be?  The allergy guy got the part! Thanks!  How could you do this to me Chandler?! This part could’ve turned my whole career around!  Hey, you don’t even live here anymore! What are you doing answering my phone? I have my machine!   And what?! Did you sleep with her?!   What?!! That’s even worse!!   I don’t know! But it’s the same!   Over the line?! You-you’re-you’re so far past the line, that you-you can’t even see the line! The line is a dot to you!  Name one!   Well, this guy came by to look at the unit and-and he said he didn’t think big enough to fit a grown man!   I was tryin’ to make a sale!! Oh, man, if I ever run into that guy again, do you know what I’m gonna do?  No way!  I\\'ve been going to the guy for 12 years.  That\\'s how they do pants!  Ross, will you tell him? Isn\\'t that how they measure pants?  I said name one!  Okay, buddy-boy. Here it is. You hide my clothes, I\\'m wearing everything you own.  Look at me! I\\'m Chandler! Could I be wearing any more clothes? Maybe if I wasn\\'t going commando...  Hey!  What message?  What?! It’s 6 o’clock!  I can’t believe this Chandler!  Well you-you-you-you might say congratulations! I saw the board! I went to the audition! I got the part!!  Oh, well I’m uh…  Oh wow! Okay man, I’m sorry. I did not mean to make you feel bad.  Yeah, you’re right. Okay look, listen, let’s talk about what a huge star I’m gonna be!  You hug me!  Hey, do we do this too much?  Yeah.  Come on C.H.E.E.S.E., I’m not leaving without you! Try routing your backup source through your primary CPU.  Ross, you don’t have to yell.  Huh? So whaddya think? Casa de Joey. Huh? I decorated it myself.  Art.  Thanks, yeah. I love this but ya know what, it makes me wanna pee.  Hey, how come, uhh, Chandler didn\\'t come?  Right, I go-, I got it.  No no no, behind it.  That\\'s right, I have a phone in here.  Yeah.  Hello.  Hey!  Oh, that\\'s OK. You uh, you had a thing.  Ahh, forget about it, I\\'m havin\\' a ball. How\\'s the apartment doin\\'  Oh, well great.  Oh, can you believe they gave Stephanie skin cancer?  Naa, you\\'re just sayin\\' that \\'cause you\\'re in love with Yasmine Blepe.  Hey, hey, they\\'re runnin\\'  I did. I thought it\\'d be great. I figured I\\'d have like, time alone with my thoughts but, ya know, it turns out I don\\'t have as many thoughts as you\\'d think.  You really think he\\'d take me? I mean, we had a pretty good talk last night but, when I moved out, I hurt him bad.  Hey.  You know it\\'s funny you should mention that \\'cause I was thinkin\\'... what\\'s with the boxes?  Wow.  Oh, now it\\'s a spare room?  Eddie.  You don\\'t keep it over here on this table any more?  Huh.  No I just uh, thought you liked your eggs with the bread with the hole in the middle, a-la me.  So how you two gettin\\' along?  Hey, this isn\\'t about juice anymore, alright man.  Eggs. Who\\'s eggs do you like better, his or mine, huh?  Oh come on. Nobody likes two different kinds of eggs equally. You like one better than the other and I wanna know which.  All right, well finish your coffee; let’s go.  To tape the game? You do this every time Ross, you’re not gonna be on TV!  Oh, you’re switching apartments?  But Rachel has an apartment.  She is?  I guess I didn’t really think about it.  Hey!  Oh, okay. I…I ate way too much.  I was kinda hoping you’d stay.  I could use a challenge! It’s getting pretty easy.  I love living with you so much. I just wish things didn’t have to change.  Y’know I blame Ross for this.  I’m gonna miss you, you’re the hottest roommate I ever had.  I’m loud!  I’m up all night!  Hello!  Look, if I’m bringing home a woman who can’t stand being around a baby, then maybe I don’t want to be with that woman! Or maybe we’ll just do it in the bathroom of the club!  Yeah! All right—Look, I know sometimes it’ll be hard, okay? But, it’ll also be really…really great. Please Rachel! I-I-I really want you to stay.  Ohh!  I know! I found it on the street.  Yeah.  I don’t know.  Ew.  Isn’t that great?  Her first cookie? She has cookies all the time!  No! No... and, for the record, I\\'ve also never given her a frosting from a can!  U-U-Um, I think there\\'s been an oversight.  Whoo-weh hey weh-hey whoo hey!!  I gotta a lot of nice stuff to say about you guys, ok? And I know how much you wanna have a baby, you know, and I would love to help you get one.  Thank you! Alright, let me see how I\\'m gonna start... \"Dear baby adoption decider people...\"  Hey!  Uhm... Aren\\'t you a little overdressed?  That\\'s right, yeah.  Always nice to meet a fan!  I know, she may be the hottest girl I\\'ve ever hated.  What did I just say?  Of course it does! It’s smart! I used the the-saurus!  Yep!  Oh, ‘They are warm, nice, people with big hearts’.  Yeah, yeah and hey, I really mean it, dude.  Why not?  What?  You slept out here?  But uhm, we\\'re getting rid of her, right? Rach, please tell me we’re getting rid of her.  \\'Cause we will appreciate it more when she’s gone?  Yeah, Monica made us!  Yeaah.  Great, I\\'m finished! In fact, I just dropped it off at the agency.  Yeah.  Chandler, she doesn\\'t understand a word of English.  She\\'s my biggest fan. Yeah, she\\'s the only one in the family that\\'s believed in me.  Yeah, I uh weighted like 27 pounds when I was born so…  Wow Pheebs, you speak Italian?  Okay, see that blind guy right there? I\\'m gonna bash his head in later.  Oh umm, my big scene is coming up. Big scene coming up.  No-no-no, that-that\\'s me, that\\'s me.  Oh, here I am, here\\'s my big scene!  That\\'s right!  No way! Mr.Salty is a sailor, all right, he\\'s got to be, like, thetoughest snack there is.  Her answer machine?  Duh, where\\'ve you been?  Man, we gotta do something about that guy. This morning, I caught him looking into our apartment. It creeps me out! I feel like I can\\'t do stuff!  Will you grow up? I\\'m not talking about sexy stuff, but, like, when I\\'m cooking naked.  Yeah, toast, oatmeal... nothing that spatters.  Maybe she never got your message.  ..Naughty!  I tried to call you from the coffee shop, and there was no answer.  Hey, so listen, I went across the street and talked to the doorman- I got the peeper\\'s name! Can I use the phone?  Yeah, she said you looked like Ingrid Bergman that day.  Big day.  All right, I\\'ll give you this, Mr. Peanut is a better dresser. I mean he\\'s got the monocle, he\\'s got the top hat...  We know its Ross!  Well that, that sounds good.  Bye.  What secrets?  Y’know, Monica and Chandler are married. Ross and Rachel are having a baby. Maybe you and I should do something.  I don’t have a key, they took mine to give to you.  Why would they take away our keys?  No that’s not it. They let me keep my key the last time they were out of town.  Hey, I washed those!  Yeah that didn’t sound like me.  Yeah, I have stuff in there too.  Yeah, it seemed pretty important.  Really?  Yeah, I don’t think that’s what it is.  Oh wow, I don’t feel well.  Please, just-just, just go and talk to Rachel.  I still can’t believe they took away my key. You trust me with yours.  What the hell is that?  Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Treeger, what are you doing?  So it’s noticeable huh?  How are you doing?  Well, what did you say to her?  Whoa! Hey! Whoa!! Hold up! Are you serious?! So like 3% of the time they don’t even work?! Huh? They should put that on the box!  Hey Monica it’s Joey. Listen uh, Phoebe and I smell gas comin’ from your apartment.  Yeah and we’d go check it out, but you took away our keys.  How? I guess I could break down your door.  Hey!  I don’t see the baby. Where is it?  Well, we were! But Ross was talking so loud on his phone they threw us out!  Well no, not yet. He\\'s calling everyone on her side of the family hoping that someone will help him get in touch with her.  Ross! Way to suck up to the family.  Don\\'t worry, I had it dry-cleaned.  Well, I\\'m doing this telethon thing on TV and my agent got me a job as co-host!  A little uh, good deed for PBS and a little TV exposure, now that\\'s the kind of math Joey likes to do!  Why don’t you like PBS, Pheebs?  I\\'m sorry Pheebs, I just, y\\'know, I just wanted to do a good deed. Like-like you did with the babies.  Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! What about you, having those babies for your brother? Talk about selfish!  Well, yeah, it was a really nice thing and all, but it made you feel really good right?  It made you feel good, so that makes it selfish. Look, there\\'s no unselfish good deeds, sorry.  Well, may I ask for one example?  That\\'s because all people are selfish.  That he doesn\\'t exist.  That\\'s great. But uh, I\\'m not really expecting a lot of calls.  But I\\'m the host!  You don\\'t seem to understand. See, I was Dr. Drake Remoray.  See, there was kind of a mix up in my agent\\'s office, but I\\'m still on TV and that\\'s good exposure.  What?! What good is that gonna do anybody?  Now, y\\'know the bee probably died after he stung ya.  Hey, excuse me, would you mind switching with me?  Come on man! You\\'ve been here all day!  Hey Pheebs!  $200? Are you sure Pheebs? I mean, after what Sesame Street did to ya?  And you don\\'t a little good about donating the money?  A hamster? What, those things are like 10 bucks.  Hey, who wants to ah, throw the ball around a little, maybe get a little three on three going?  Great, you can cover Chandler.  Come on man! You never want to do anything since you and Janice broke up.  Chandler, you have to start getting over her. All right, if you play, you get some fresh air, maybe it’ll take your mind off Janice, and if you don’t play, everyone will be mad at you ‘cause the teams won’t be even. Come on.  Says who? Your mom?  All right, we have to pick captains.  Thank you.  Set....hike!  Haaaaa! Hey-hey, thanks for stopping our ball.  Yeah! Wow, your like from a whole other country.  Hi-hi, I’m Joey.  I’m sorry Dutch, I didn’t get that last little bit.  Her name is Dutch, and also Marklan.  Mar-klan.  I think so.  Thanks man, but I think it makes a stronger statement if I ask for it myself, y\\'know.  Oh, yeah, that. All right, means that much to ya, I’ll let you have her.  Well I don’t like to say it out loud, but, yeah! Don’t feel bad man, we all have our strengths. You’re better with numbers and stuff.  Fumble!  What the hell’s the matter with you?! This is my favourite jersey.  All right, that’s it. Y\\'know I was still gonna let you have her. But now, forget about it. Prepare to feel very bad about yourself.  Pheebs, run!  After!!  It’s hard, y\\'know, his huddle is closer to Dutch girl.  What are you gonna do?  Okay.  Here you go!  Yeah, Chandler finds me so intimdating that it’s better if we’re on the same team.  Ah well, the ah, Pennsylvania Dutch, come from Pennsylvania.  Whoa, whoa, no, no, I-I’m not playing with this guy, now.  Wait a minute! Wait a minute! She obviously didn’t understand the question.  Nice going. You just saved yourself a couple months of sex.  This sucks, I was just up by that much!  When they’re hungry enough, they’ll come in.  Yeah, sure. Well y\\'know, earlier she was talking about geography.  Well, I think we all learned something.  That you’re actually 50?  Hey, Bonnie had sex there!  No, it’s just my luggage.  Woo-hoo! All right! Yeah!  Hey-hey, check out the hat!  I mean naked game. Strip poker, we should totally play strip poker.  Come on! When you go away, you-you have to play, it’s like a law!  Hey, you know what naked card game is never boring?  What?  Okay, all right.  Fan out! Fan out!  Yeah, well, I couldn’t find any cards, so it was either this or Strip Bag Of Old Knitting Stuff.  All right, relax. It’s just a shoe.  Fine. Gang up on me! I got you all right where I want you.  Actually, y\\'know it’s kinda cold, so how about I keep my boxers on, and give you all a peek at the good stuff?  We’re playing Strip Happy Days Game!  What’s the matter, Pheebs?  What?!  But I made cards!!  I’m telling ya, you guys are totally getting back together!  So let me get this straight. If you go with Bonnie tonight, you’re doing the smart, healthy thing and moving on.  Right, and you go with Rachel, Bonnie’s free tonight?  Whoa-whoa-whoa. Jokes? You guys know they have naked chicks in there, right?  Let’s go watch it at your place.  Chandler, Chandler, y’know what we should do? You and I should go out and get some new sunglasses.  No, that’s VH-1. I gotta tell you, the music these kids listen to today . . . It’s like a lotta noise to me. I don’t know…  I uh, oh! Because, uh, I haven’t really paid the bill  No, Chandler. Look, forget about it, okay? Look, I know things have been a little tight since Janine moved out. Oh, was she hot.  Sure.  Not so much.  You forget how many great songs Heart had.  Oh, you guys, with this joke. I gotta say, I know I cracked up, but I’m not even sure I got it.  Ah, Gunther, I can’t pay for this right now because I’m not working, so I’ve had to cut down on some luxuries like uh, payin’ for stuff.  Uh, I don’t know. Ya see, it’s just, see I was a regular on a soap opera y’know? And to go from that to this, I just… Plus, I’d have to wait on all my friends.  What?!  Maybe I could be a waiter. Could I use the phone?  Hey Ross, listen, you want anything to drink, ‘cause I’m heading up there.  You got it.  Okay, but I don’t see you asking any other paying customers to put on aprons.  No.  Yeah?  It’s kind of embarrassing, y’know. I mean, I was an actor and now I’m a waiter. It’s supposed to go in the other direction.  I mean, the job’s easy and the money’s good, you know? I guess I’m going to be hanging out here anyway. I might as well get paid for it, right? I just feel kind of weird serving you guys.  Okay, I guess it doesn’t seem that weird.  See, now it’s weird again.  Thanks, Rach. Look, you guys are just terrific. Y’know? Now, how about clearing out of here so I can get some new customers. It’s all about turnover.  Oh, I’m sorry, Ross. I’ll get it for you right now. And since I made you wait, I’ll toss in a free muffin.  Hey, Gunther. Can you uh, can you cover for me? I just got an audition.  Really?! I like your natural color. Come on man, it’s a great part. Look, check it out. I’m the lead guy’s best friend and I wait for him in this bar and save his seat. Listen-listen. ‘I’m sorry, that seat’s saved.’  Okay, maybe he’s not his best friend, but …  Oh, man, I could totally get that part. ‘I’m sorry, that seat is taken.’  No, no, I didn’t mean you. But, you believed me, huh?  So, you’d hire me, right?  Exactly! All right, everybody, listen up. The coffeehouse is going to be closed for about an hour.  Yeah, it’s for the kids. To keep the kids off drugs. It’s a very important issue in this month’s Playboy. I’m sure you all read about it.  Not good, no. I didn’t get the part, and I lost my job here, so …  Well, I had the audition but Gunther said I had to stay here and be in charge so he could go get his hair dyed. So, I went anyway, and then he fired me.  Yeah, what are ya gonna do?  That’s great. Thanks Rach.  I’m not answering that.  Hey Rach listen, did you know that during pregnancy your fingers swell up to twice their size and never go back.  I just want you to say it once in a while.  What?!  Phoebe!  No they’re not! They’re ugly and stupid and delicious!  She is?  Yeah. But I thought that was because I put the whole thing on my hand and made it walk across the table.  But you gotta have turkey on Thanksgiving! I mean, Thanksgiving with no turkey is like-like Fourth of July with no apple pie! Or Friday with no two pizzas!  No there won’t! I promise I will finish that turkey!  Let me explain to you how the human body works. I have to warm my stomach first. Eatin’ chips is like stretching.  Don’t worry, Tribbianis never get full.  Oh hey!  That’s it?! Even if nobody helps me I can eat that no problem. At least give me a challenge!  I’m afraid I’m gonna need proof.  You are my Everest.  Not now! These are my Thanksgiving pants!  No just, nobody press on my stomach.  Whoa—hey—wh-wh-what do you got there? What is that? Pie?  Look, I’ll come to the party but I’m not dressing up.  No way! Look, Halloween is so stupid! Dressing up, pretending to be someone you’re not…  That hot girl from their wedding?  Well hey-hey if she needs any idea for costumes, she could be a bikini model, or a slutty nurse, or a sexy cheerleader huh—Ooh-ooh, Leatherface from The Texas Chainsaw Massacre—No-no-no! Slutty Leatherface.  Yeah.  Exclusively.  Catwoman, hands down.  But between you and Phoebe, I’d have to give the edge to Phoebe.  Are you kiddin’? Phoebe lived on the street. Okay? Plus, she’s got this crazy temper. She—She’s not standing right behind me is she?  I’m not sure.  Will you relax?! What are you taking this so seriously for? It doesn’t matter.  I would say, \"Woman, please!\"  Okay, here’s a good one for ya. Who do think would win in a fight between Ross and Chandler.  So Ross?  Monica and I were talking about who could kick whose ass in a fight, you or Ross?  So you think Ross too?  Yeah. Listen to the slutty nurse.  Seriously guys, the trash talk is embarrassing.  Rach?  Or equally weak.  Hey!  That’s not so bad.  Come on! You’re good with kids. They’re just crazy on Halloween. Y’know, they’re all greedy and hopped up on sugar!  Oh, yeah, good idea.  Right over there! Right there! Look-look-look!  You got to go on a ride along?!  I want to go on a ride along!  Oh-ho, yeah!  Yep!  Yeah, okay.  Did I say you could smell it?!  Half the taste is in the smell! You-you\\'re sucking up all the tastiness!  Okay, imagine the best sex you\\'ve ever had.  Are you thinking about Monica?  Yeah, what\\'s that like?  Oh what? Like your Mr. Cop!  Yeah, what\\'s up with that Serpico?  Is everything okay?  Hi.  Yeah, I didn\\'t know that.  Cut it out Ross! I hate to have to save your life and kick your ass in the same day!  Dude! How come you took off?  Is something wrong?  Okay.  That\\'s what this is about! Oh my God, you hate Ross!  Of course you do! I saved him! You\\'re mad at me! It all adds up! You want Ross out of the picture.  I don\\'t know, but I don\\'t like what I\\'m hearing!  Ohh, you\\'re upset because you think I chose Ross over you! No! I…knew…you could take care of yourself. Y\\'know, I mean Ross, he need help. He\\'s not street like us!  Well, no, not exactly! All right, look, I, I wasn\\'t trying to save Ross. Okay? My sandwich was next to Ross. All right? I was, I was trying to save my sandwich.  I know it doesn\\'t make much sense…  Look Chandler, it was instinct! Okay? I just went for it!  No! I would never do that! You-you\\'re like my brother!  No, eh, oh-oi, easy, it\\'s not a hot dog!  How good is that?  See?  Oh-whoa-hey, dude, what are you doing?!  wow, the parade is really good this year. Man those horses can crap.  Oh my God!  Yeah! I totally forgot I\\'m supposed to be there. I can\\'t believe I forgot. I usually write stuff like this on my arm.  I guess I\\'m going to have to come up with a really good reason why I wasn\\'t there. The producers are going to be so mad at me. They sat us all down yesterday and said \"Everyone has to be there at 6:00 AM sharp, that means you Tribbiani.\" Like.. like I was some kind of idiot.  Hey happy Thanksgiving.. Pheebs! <motions her to come over>  I.. I.. I need a good lie.  No, no, no I need a good lie to explain why I wasn\\'t at a work thing today.  I do not.  Somebody opened the door to the coffee house and a raccoon came running in, went straight for your muffin and I said \"Hey don\\'t eat that-that\\'s Phoebe\\'s\" and he said.. <pause> He said.. \"Joey you stink at lying.\" What am I going to do?  Oh great, that\\'d be great. Thank you.  Uh.. <forgetting what the work thing was, rolls up his sleeve on his right arm and shows Phoebe, she looks>  Oh.. man..  Pheebs, I still need some help here  Oh.. I don\\'t know why this is so hard for me. you know.. I mean lying is basically just acting and I am a terrfic actor.  Hey! How come my plate\\'s less fancy then everyone else\\'s? Do you not trust me with a fancy plate?  I can\\'t believe I won.  Yeah he\\'s lying. He looked down.  I lie better then that, right?  Oh, I like that, yeah. Wasn\\'t at the parade because I had a family emergency.  Arg... Alright, I\\'ll take care of it. <throws hands out in the air>  Setting the table.  ooh oooh..  What? Are you out of your mind? Lets throw some jello on them.  Actually its not pies, its just pie.  Hey! I did it. I called my producer. I told him I had a family emergency, he totally bought it. Thanks for teaching me how to lie Pheebs.  I\\'m tellin\\' you Ross, she wants you.  You\\'re in!  Excuse me, could we get an egg over here, still in the shell? Thanks.  Yeah, you\\'re gonna go up to her and say, \"Here\\'s your egg back, I\\'m returning your egg.\"  Think it\\'ll work?  Actually, tomorrow night kinda depends on how tonight goes.  No, no, no, don\\'t you dare bail on me. The only reason she\\'s goin\\' out with me is because I said I could bring a friend for her friend.  No, no, no, don\\'t! I\\'ve been waitin\\' for like, forever to go out with Lorraine. Just calm down.  Uh, can I talk to you for a second, over there?  Uh, we might be leaving now.  She said she wants to slather my body with stuff and then lick it off. I\\'m not even sure what slathering is, but I definitely want to be a part of it.  You\\'re right, I\\'m sorry. You\\'re right.  I\\'m outta here. Here\\'s my credit card. Dinner\\'s on me. I\\'m sorry, Chandler.  I don\\'t know. You dumped her on New Year\\'s.  It really hit me last night. I\\'m gonna be on Days of our Lives. And then I started thinkin\\' about all of u, and how these are the days of our lives..  Are you really not going?  Hey, if she were marrying a guy, she\\'d be like the worst lesbian ever.  No, I\\'m on right after this guy shoots himself.  Yeah, and she\\'s really nice too. She taught me all about how to work the cameras, and smell-the-fart acting.  It\\'s like, you got so many lines to learn so fast, that sometimes you need a minute to remember your next one. So while you\\'re thinkin\\' of it, you take this big pause where you look all intense, you know, like this.  I\\'m afraid the situation is much worse than we expected. Your sister is suffering from a..subcranial hematoma. Perhaps we can discuss this over coffee.  All right, all right. \"Damnit Braverman, it\\'s right there on the chart!\"  I can\\'t believe you\\'re so uptight about your mom comin\\'.  Uh, Pheebs, how long do you think this lady\\'ll be with us?  Pheebs, who\\'s Evelyn Dermer?  They didn\\'t fight a lot?  Hey, look who\\'s up.  I\\'m sorry, it\\'s the pigs. they\\'re reluctant to get in the blankets!  It just seems so futile, you know ? All these women, and nothing. I feel like Superman without my powers, you know? I have the cape, and yet I cannot fly.  Suck-fest.  Hey, I don\\'t need violence to enjoy a movie. Just so long as there\\'s a little nudity.  I meant female nudity. Alright? I don\\'t need to see Lou Grant frolicking.  I agree. I\\'m, like, in disbelief.  She really said that?  \\'Tonight\\' tonight?  How could you lose him?  Alright alright. You\\'re a monkey. You\\'re loose in the city. Where do you go?  Marcel?  Marcel?  A monkey.  Um, sure! Did you, uh, did you try turning the knob back the other way?  Oh. Then, no.  Uh, aren\\'t we kind of in the middle of something here?  Marcel?  I dunno, I loved high school. Y\\'know? It was just four years of parties and dating and sex.  How many times do I have to tell you! Ya, turn and sliiiide! Y\\'know, turn and slide.  Look, we’re not throwing it out! I built this thing with my own hands!  Looks good, uh?  Hey, the ad alone cost 300 bucks!  What kind of profit is that?! And you call yourself an accountant.  Oh. What do you do?  What? What’s wrong?  Well, there were a couple of calls last night, but ah, I don’t think any of them are gonna work out.  Pretty nice?  Uh, Pheebs, about your mom...  This is the unit for you my friend. Sturdy construction, tons of storage compartments, some big enough to fit a grown man.  Oh yeah! I got in there myself once. My roommate bet me five bucks that I couldn’t, and then he stuck a board through the handles that locked me in. Yeah. It was funny ‘til I started feeling like I was in a coffin.  Sometimes I get in here just to get away from it! Hey, a nickel!!  Yeah...  Well, this guy came by to look at the unit and-and he said he didn’t think big enough to fit a grown man!  I was tryin’ to make a sale!! Oh, man, if I ever run into that guy again, do you know what I’m gonna do?  Dude, you don’t have to brag! We got nothing here!!  Wow! This girl is good.  Phew, close one.  Is ah, is Chandler around?  Oooh.  Nooo. No, no, ah, are you sure it wasn’t something that sounded like Ginger, like ah, Gingeer?  Aww, man. That’s the girl I was hiding from. When she finds out he’s my roommate, she’s gonna tell him what I did.  What, oh, oh, oh, no, no, I can’t, I can’t tell you that, it’s like the most awful, horrible thing I’ve ever done my whole life.  All right!! Okay, it was like four years ago. Okay, Ginger and I had gone out a few times, and then this one weekend, we went up to her Dad’s cabin. Just me, her, and her annoying little dog Pepper. Well that night, I cooked this really romantic dinner....  I wish. No. After dinner, me, her, and Pepper all fell asleep in front of the fire. Well I woke up in the middle of the night and I saw that the fire was dying out. So, I picked up a log and threw it on. Or, at least what I thought was a log.  I wish. See, I guess another thing I probably should’ve told you about Ginger is that she kinda has a ah, artificial leg.  I ran!!  Listen, I ah, I know it’s a longshot. But, by any chance did she find that funny?  Yeah. You okay?  Yeah.  Where have you been?  Uhhh, mine too! Yeah.  Yeah, I got too excited!  It\\'s called Shutter Speed, it\\'s really cool! Yeah, umm, I meet this girl in the subway and we fall in love in like a day, right? And then, she disappears… But I find out where she lives and when I get there this like old lady answers the door and I say, \"Where\\'s Betsy?\" Right? And she says, \"Betsy\\'s been dead for 10 years.\"  Road trip! Yeah, we can rent a car! I just have to be there by Tuesday!  All right! Thanks Pheebs!  Oh umm, not go.  I can\\'t decide which route to take to Vegas. Hey, you\\'ve traveled a lot right?  Okay, so-so which route should I take the northern route or the southern route?  Great! Problem solved!  Well, back to square one.  Peanut butter!  A swimmer!  Monica. Oh… huh, I always thought it would be Rachel.  Ascot!  North route!  Wow! That was incredible! Beard of bees, here I come!  Hey man, what\\'s up?  Sure, what do you want to see?  Oh, I know how we can decide. Phoebe, show him your game!  I don\\'t know. But hey, I know we can decide. Okay, I\\'m gonna ask you questions and you answer real quick. Okay?  What do you like better action or comedy?  Who would you rather sleep with Monica or Rachel?  Oh, I\\'m sorry. I forgot you had that whole Rachel thing.  Hey! You ready to go?  Man, I wish Ross was coming with us! Y\\'know? I\\'m gonna miss him!  Uh no, not really. It\\'s an independent film y\\'know? So we don\\'t have a real big budget. I figured I\\'d just stay in your room.  Oh yeah! For every dollar Shutter Speed makes, one penny of it goes right in Joey\\'s pocket.  Did you not hear the plot of the movie? \"She\\'s been dead for ten years.\" I\\'m gonna be a millionaire!  Hey!  You got it!  Bye-bye!  Anybody want to say good-bye to me at the car?  Man, I\\'m getting pretty tired. You\\'re might have to take over soon.  Yeah. Okay. Ross\\'s treat! Where do you wanna eat?  Ooh, hey, I know how we can decide! All right, uh, I\\'m gonna ask you a bunch of questions and then you have to answer real fast. Okay? So uh, clear your mind Clear it right out! Clear it out! Clear!  Okay, uhh, would you rather be too wet or too dry?  Do you believe in ghosts, yes or no?  Is this movie gonna be my big break?  Dude you said, \"No!\"  You don\\'t think this is going to be a big break for me?  I don\\'t believe this!  What are you talking about?! I\\'m the lead in a movie!  Y\\'know what? I don\\'t need this! Okay? I don\\'t know why you\\'re dumping all over my big break.  Is that why you\\'re on this trip, huh? Make me feel like a loser? \\'Cause if it is, I\\'ll tell ya, I-I-I\\'d rather be alone.  Not if you\\'re gonna be like this!  Yeah! I don\\'t want you on the trip!  Get out!!  Let\\'s just say there\\'s a well-dressed pack of dogs in Ohio. Hey Monica listen is-is Phoebe there? I gotta ask her something about the car.  Hey Pheebs! Listen, this wooden box keeps sliding out from under the seat. What-what is it?  Hey-hey! Stanley! Hey-hey! You\\'re leading man is here! Let\\'s get to work.  Wh-what?! Why?!  What?!  Uh, hang out?! How long?  No!  Yeah.  Aw, come on! It\\'ll be years before I forget you!  Uh, well yeah-yeah, I\\'ve got all of that going on. Yeah, listen uh, I want you to make sure you tell Chandler that he couldn\\'t have been more wrong! Uh-oh! I gotta go Monica, my uh, my sushi\\'s here!  No.  Oh, I’m sorry. I meant no.  Dude I just did something terrible.  No! No, that was Jack! Rachel thinks I asked her to marry me!  Because it kinda looked like I did.  Okay well, I was down on one knee with the ring in my hand…  It wasn’t my ring! It fell out of Ross’s jacket! And when I knelt down to pick it up Rachel thought I was proposing!  I guess.  I know! I know it’s awful.  Oh God, what the hell am I going to tell him?  Oh, I like that. Yeah…  It can’t be me, I’m standing right here.  Hey uh, is it okay to come in?  Yeah uh look Rach, there’s something I gotta tell ya.  Dear Lord.  Oh uh-uh yeah, I think that…  Y’know, I don’t really know her.  No! She had the ring on, she seemed so excited, and then she took her breast out.  I didn’t look at it. Stupid baby’s head was blocking most of it.  Look, it’s not that easy. She said she wanted to marry me. I don’t want to hurt her.  I can come back.  No.  Actually, technically, I didn’t.  No! No, and I did not ask her to marry me!  No, I didn’t!  No, I didn’t!  Ahhh!  Yeah. Yeah, that looks bad. But I didn’t…I didn’t propose!  Okay, the ring fell on the floor and I went down to pick it up and you thought I was proposing.  No, I didn’t!  No, I didn’t!  Well I tried, but people kept coming in and then you took your breast out!  It wasn’t my ring! It’s Ross’s ring! That’s why I felt so bad Rach, because he was going to propose.  Well, this is awkward. {See? I told you so.}  Dude, step up! I proposed.  Oh that’s right. There’s a lot going on here and I think I ate some bad fruit earlier.  I can’t believe you’re not going to propose!  Oh yeah, dude, I totally understand. Usually after I have a baby with a woman I like to slow things down!  Y’know what you guys? I’m uh, I’m gonna go too. And uh, I’m sorry about everything.  I think I left a donut up here.  Hey!  Chandler, look they’re actors. They’re there to do a job, just ‘cause they work together, doesn’t mean they’re gonna get together. I mean just ‘cause it happened with Susan Sarandon and Tim Robbins, it doesn’t mean it’s gonna happen with them.  Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman.  Okay look, look, let me ask you a question, when they were doing it on stage, was it like really hot?  Well okay, so then you’re fine. The rule is when two actors are actually doing it off-stage all the sexual tension between them is gone. Okay? So as long as it’s hot onstage you got nothing to worry about. It’s when the heat goes away, that’s when you’re in trouble.  Look, you guys have been to every play I’ve ever been in, have I ever had chemistry on stage?  Noooo!!  Hey Mon! Want some pancakes?  Yep! Grab a plate.  Listen also we’re uh, we’re watching the game here Saturday night, if people want to come over.  Oh yeah, who’s playing?  All right Pheebs, stick out your plate!  I don’t know, it smells good.  Come here.  Oh, yeah, totally! That’s such a turn-on!  Oh-ooh, that’s the turn-on.  Oh-oh-oh-oh, how I do it is, I look a woman up and down and say, \"Hey, how you doin’?\"  Well, you gotta give him something that he can’t say no too. Like uh, Knicks tickets! Invite the guy to a Knicks game, you’re guaranteed he’ll say yes!  Absolutely! And if it doesn’t, can I get the extra ticket?  What the heck is that?  No! Forget her, man! You don’t need her, you don’t need that!  Dude, tell me she actually told you this.  Whoa-whoa, that-that was just a theory! There’s a lot of theories that didn’t pan out. The lone gunman. Communism. Geometry.  Okay, for next time, what do you say?  What’s ready?  I don’t know, it looks the same.  Oh yeah!  How’d it go?  It’s a grand tradition!  This is so unfair! The one thing I wanted to do was throw my best friend a bachelor party, but no, I wasn’t allowed to. All I got was a stupid steak dinner!  Oh yeah, that was a pretty good night.  So uh, you and Mona, been a while now. How’s it going?  Hot?  I’m gonna take that book and beat you to death with it.  Will you let the lady talk?!  Yeah!  So you uh, nervous about getting married?  Look, look let’s pretend it’s a real bachelor party. Okay? Y’know? Before your wedding. Come on, it’ll be fun.  How does it feel knowing you’re never gonna be with another woman again huh? Knowing you’re gonna have to wake up to the same face everyday until you finally have the sweet release of death.  Uh, that-that’s-that’s me!  Joey Tribbiani, a big fan.  Why-why would she go in the bedroom?  Yeah, that’s one naked hooker!  Wait! Wait! Maybe she’s a hooker and a stripper, but she got confused about what she’s supposed to do.  Maybe Monica’s playing a joke on ya. Y’know? Getting her own husband a hooker, that’s pretty funny.  I bet Ross was in on it too. I mean he was conveniently busy.  Maybe she meant to get you a hooker.  Maybe she wants you to learn something. Huh? Now is there anything you’re really bad at y’know, sexually?  In a minute!  All right, all right maybe-maybe you should just ask her to leave.  Hey! It’s your bachelor party.  I don’t want to. You do it!  You do it!  I miss this.  No, I-I miss hanging out with you.  Not like we used to. Remember? You and me used to be inseparable. Y’know now it’s like…things are different.  Oh sure—And hey, don’t get me wrong, I am so happy for you guys. I just…I miss…hanging out…just-just us, y’know?  Great! All right, so I’ll call you later.  That would be Casey. We’re going out tonight.  No, things are fine with Kathy. I’m having a late dinner with her tonight, right after my early dinner with Casey.  Yeah. Why are you getting so upset?  What is the big deal? It’s not like we’re exclusive.  You got all that from the back of her head?  Who’s Elaine?  We broke down on the Parkway, so I have to walk back and get some transmission fluid. And hey, listen could you please tell Kathy that I’ll be there as soon as I can.  Yeah?  Listen uh, I’m really sorry, it looks like I’m gonna be stuck here for a while. I got the transmission fluid, but when I went to put it in the car, the transmission wasn’t there!  Yeah, it must’ve fallen out a few blocks back. I just figured we hit a dog.  Listen uh, could you put Kathy on, I wanna apologize.  Why?  Well, you’re amazing.  Oh, you are the best friends anyone has ever had.  Oh-no-no-no, you are! You do this, you give me the great advice, and hey listen, I was thinking about what you said yesterday about focusing on one woman, I’m gonna do that.  No-no-no, I think I’m gonna see how things go with Kathy. She’s pretty cool.  No-no, Kathy.  No. No, Kathy.  Y’know what I think? I think somebody’s got a little crush on Casey. How ‘bout I fix you two up? What do you think?  Hey! Samboucha Margarita?  Well, we only had samboucha, so it is now.  What’s up?  You do?  Well, you’re timing couldn’t be better. She’s not my girlfriend anymore.  Yeah, she broke up with me.  Just now, after acting class. At first I thought she was doing some kind of scene, that’s why I let people watch.  Well, I’ve been better. But, I’m all right. So you like her huh?  No-no-no, no it’s uh, it’s okay.  Yeah. You know why? ‘Cause you came to me first.  But hey, listen just so you know, you might have you’re work cut out for you. ‘Cause when I talked to her, I kinda got the feeling that she’s into some other guy. So…  Who?  What?  And what?! Did you sleep with her?!  What?!! That’s even worse!!  I don’t know! But it’s the same!  Who cares?! You went behind my back! I would never do that to you!  Over the line?! You-you’re-you’re so far past the line, that you-you can’t even see the line! The line is a dot to you!  Probably Monica and Chandler.  Hey guys! Look who’s back! It’s Ray-ray!  What?!  Hey, so where are my parents gonna be?  What they’re not invited?! Oh no, that’s terrible! They’re gonna be crushed!  Well, I’m sorry. I thought parents were coming! Y’know? Your parents are comin’! Chandler’s parents are comin’! Ross’s parents are comin’!  Well-well—see? Parents are comin’!  Nice move.  Hey!  No, I’m performing the ceremony. I’m not wearing a tux.  Multi-colored robes! Ooh, and maybe a hat.  I don’t think so.  Oh good! Can I tell her?! Can I tell her?!  Okay…  Why are you taking this away from me?  Oh-ho, you should get inside my head.  Hey.  Yeah, they’re not coming.  Somehow they got the idea that you only invited them because of me. They…feel a little unwanted.  Look Mon, if you could just call my mom…  Come on! Look just-just tell—let her know that you really want them to be there. Let’s not forget, this is a woman that has sent you many lasagnas over the years.  Is it her fault that some of them didn’t make it to you?  Listen, I know the invitation says 6:00, but does that mean that you want people to get there at six, or the show is gonna start right at six?  Right. Right. The wedding, gotcha. But I mean, it’s gonna start a little late right? I mean, weddings start late. Right?  Ah. Yeah. Well look, the thing is it’s the same day as my niece’s christening and I really want my parents to be there in time to see me. ‘Cause my part’s just in the beginning I’m not even in the rest of the show—Wedding!  Okay. Okay, I totally hear ya. Oo how about this? I vamp a little ‘til they get there?  No! No, I-I just wanna thank you guys for what you did for my parents, that was really sweet. They’re so happy they get to be a part of your special day.  See, this is a great apartment.  Uhh, Pheebs, those are uh, those are Santa pants.  You have Knicks tickets?  Yeah!  You’re not stupid. You’re meaner than I thought.  Yeah, you do!  Come on!  Come on, season tickets! Season tickets, do you know what that means?  Oh come—look, when I was a kid my dad’s company gave season tickets to the number one salesman every year, all right? My dad never won! Of course, he wasn’t in the sales division, but still, I never ever, ever forgot that!  Hey!  We don’t make enough fun of you already?  Oh-no, don’t try and talk all normal with that thing in your ear.  What?  All right look, Ross, he’s right. Emily’s great, she’s great! But this way too soon, you’re only gonna scare her!  No! You don’t want to wreck it, you don’t want to go to fast!  Yes! Didn’t you ever read Sports Illustrated?! No! I didn’t read yours! But come on, we can go to the game tonight!  It’s the Knicks!  Whoa!  Huh.  Yeah, the Knicks rule all!  Done!  Oh.  Ooh, we could end up with nothing.  Ooh, I like that.  Come on man, you know I’d do it for you! Because, you’re my best friend.  All right!  Okay!  What’s the game?! What’s the game?!  Uhh, they’re tall.  Oh.  What? Ace is high! Jack, queen, king, ace!  Okay.  Why?!  Oh yeah. Hey! Should we give these shirts to the girls? Y’know, kinda like a peace offering.  I don’t know.  I don’t want to move again!  That was one good minute!  Good night.  Ross has some big thing to tell everyone.  Yeah! Yeah!  Ok, you know what blows my mind? Women can see breasts any time they want. You just look down and there they are. How you get any work done is beyond me.  No plans, huh?  Why do you have to break up with her? Be a man, just stop calling.  My god, Angela.  You look good.  You don\\'t say.  Bob? Who the hell\\'s Bob?  Come on, we were great together. And not just at the fun stuff, but like, talking too.  What?  Fine, fine, so, why don\\'t the four of us go out and have dinner together tonight? You know, as friends?  You know, you and Bob, and me and my girlfriend, uh, uh, Monica.  Monica, I\\'m tellin\\' you, this guy is perfect for you.  Come on. This guy\\'s great. His name\\'s Bob. He\\'s Angela\\'s... brother. He\\'s smart, he\\'s sophisticated, and he has a real job. Me, I go on three auditions a month and call myself an actor, but Bob is...  What?  Eww! Look, I\\'m asking a favor here. If I do this for her brother, maybe Angela will come back to me.  Yep.  Which what?  No, but he\\'s...  Oh my god.  I suddenly had the feeling that I was falling. But I\\'m not.  So, you and Angela, huh?  You\\'re a lucky man. You know what I miss the most about her? That cute nibbly noise when she eats. Like a happy little squirrel, or a weasel.  Oh, yeah, yeah, listen for it.  Yeah, but it\\'s not gonna last. She\\'s too much for me in bed. Sexually.  What?  Come on, they\\'re close.  Oh, like you\\'ve never gotten a little rambunctious with Ross.  Well, who\\'s to say what\\'s true? I mean...  All right, look, I\\'m not proud of this, ok? Well, maybe I am a little.  Ow!  Wait, wait, wait. You want him, I want her. He likes you.  Yeah. I\\'m thinking, if we put our heads together, between the two of us, we can break them up.  Uh, waiter, one more plate of chicken wings over here.  Excellent.  I want you.I need you.Let me make love to you.  Oh, ehm...I\\'m...I\\'m rehearsing my lines.They gave me a big romantic story on Days Of Our Lives. It\\'s the first time my character\\'s got one. I\\'m so nervous, you know, I really want it to be good!  Yeah!Hey, you just have to promise not to get yourself thrown out again.  Also so gay!  Well, at the Christmas party him and Santa did some definitely gay stuff!  Oh, wish me luck!  Rach, I gotta say...if you weren\\'t here wondering if these guys were gay I don\\'t know if I could do this!  Hey!  Oh, you know, the writing was good, and the director is good, and... and my co-star\\'s good but they\\'re not as good as me!  Ow, I\\'m just going over the script now! You wanna read lines with me?  Oh, all right, I can ask Monica.  What?  Ah, Rach, it doesn\\'t say that!  but, but..  Hey!  I was making a peanut butter smoothy, right?  What?  Oh...I don\\'t think it\\'s going very well...  Well, I\\'m feeling really insecure about the one we are shooting tomorrow...  A little. Yeah no, I really am worried, you know, I mean I have to make it convincing that I\\'m in love with Olivia.  So...I\\'ve never played that!  Uh...well...just once...with you...  Alright, no peeking. No peeking, no peeking, no peeking.  Huh? Days of our Lives picked up my option.  I know.  Uh-huh.  We dare.  What if we have to pee?  Wow, look at that. The car is on fire, yet somehow it\\'s expensive paint job is protected by the Miracle Wax.  Hi.  What\\'re you doin\\' here? Aren\\'t you supposed to be out with Rachel?  She laughed at you?  It certainly is a miracle.  No, inside good, outside bad.  Is that the fire alarm?  Cool.  I can\\'t believe it. When you guys come back, you\\'re gonna have a baby! That is so weird!  But just think, ok? What if everything goes right? What if this woman does pick you guys?  So... who\\'s your friend?  OW, why, why, why?  Oh, name one friend of yours that I did that with.  Mandy, uh? Uh... really hot blonde, big boobs?  Ok, I may not have treated your friends well in the past, but I have grown up a lot, really. Honest, Rach?  Saraaah.  I can see why, nice shirt!  Stupid Gap on every corner!  Hey.  Well...  Nope.  Hey, hey, look! It’s not about a few fries... it’s about what the fries represent.  ALL FOOD!  Hey, hey, hey, hey. Look. I take a girl out, she can order whatever she wants! The more, the better! All right? Just don’t order a Garden salad and then eat my food! That’s a good way to lose some fingers!  I think were not wearing the same shirt anymore!!  Oh, that looks great! Good ordering!  Uuuh.. yes, they are my stuffed clams.  I don\\'t like it when people take food off of my plate, okay?  WELL, I DIDN\\'T MEAN IT!  I really am sorry about, you know..before. I just want to make sure you know that I really do like you.  Uh, excuse me sir, there seems to be some sort of red crap on my cheesecake.  Oh, all right, I\\'ll just have what she\\'s having instead.  Oh yeah, sure. No problem.  Why, just a tiny little...  Oh-oh!  I\\'m not even sorry.  Ooh... Not so good.  Yeah, and you know what? We could do a lot worse.  Can I see the comics?  Okay, may I see the comics?  Yeah, you shoulda been there last night.  Well Ross was hangin’ out over at our place, Rachel comes over to borrow some moisturiser from Chandler....  Anyway! Her and Ross just started yelling at each other.  Well, I guess he says that because they were on a break when it happened, that she should of forgiven him by now.  I had the same dream!  Oh, I had the opposite dream.  Yeah, I mean it’s never taken me a week to get over a relationship.  Oh yeah.  You’re smoking again?!  It’ll be great for next weekend.  Uh, Pheebs we kinda need you to drive us all up there in your grandmother’s cab, but y\\'know what, I’ll stay.  What? Mine aren’t tinted.  Oh, now I have to go!!  What’s going on?  Relax okay, I-I-I can get this open. Anybody have a coat hanger?  Look, I just need a wire something to jimmy it. Oh hey, one of you guys give me the underwire from your bra!  Come on! Who has the biggest boobs?  Whoever has the biggest boobs, has the biggest bra, therefore has the biggest wire.  If you wanna get back in the car, we need the wire, your call.  Thank you Phoebe, that is very, very generous.  Oh yeah, Smokey Joe here got half way to the highway and collapsed.  Okay, done.  That’s ‘help’ spelled backwards so that the helicopters can read it from the air!  Arrrghh!!  Guys, do you think we should ask Ross to come along?  I-I can’t handle this, you guys.  Yeah, and not put us in the middle.  Oh what, wait, wait a second, I mean, what are we doing? Who’s going with who?  Come on man, you drove all the way up here.  Since always. It\\'s like dating language. Y\\'know, like \\'It\\'s not you\\' means \\'It is you\\'.  Yeah. Cushions the blow.  \"Warden, in five minutes my pain will be over. But you\\'ll have to live with the knowledge that you sent an honest man to die.\"  Thanks! Let\\'s keep going.  \"I just wanna go back to my cell. \\'Cause in my cell, I can smoke.\"  What?  Whoah!  Hey!  No no no, I am not giving you a cigarette.  Y\\'miss it?  That\\'s ridiculous!  Y\\'okay, Phoebe?  What are you talking about? Keep it!  So when do we get to meet the guy?  Let it go, Ross.  You can come in, but your filter-tipped little buddy has to stay outside!  Know what was great? The way his smile was kinda crooked.  Alan.  ...Does the knuckle-cracking bother everybody?  Well, is it, like, a little annoying, or is it like when Phoebe chews her hair?  Do you have any respect for your body?  Even nicer when everyone gets to wear their underwear..  So that\\'s it? It\\'s over? Just like that?  Okay!  Uh, listen I gotta double check for tickets tonight. Who-who got what?  Two it is. Ross, how about you?  But you said one.  Okay.  Oh, hey, you guys are finally gonna get to meet Kate!  The green bottle next to the shaving cream.  So, so, what’d ya think?  I-I wasn’t in that.  Yeah.  Oh, hey, Lauren. Uh, you guys this is, this is Kate’s understudy, Lauren.  Hey you guys, this is my agent, Estelle.  No, they-they weren’t in the play.  Yes!!! Ha-ha-ha!  Anyone mind if I save this?  Hey! Are you okay?  Listen, drama critics they’re nothing but, but people who couldn’t make it as actors. You know what you should do?  Oh, classy.  Wow! Yeah I ah, I gave up a job too.  Uh, de-clawing cats. Hey, tell ya what. Let me walk you home. We’ll stop by every news stand and burn every copy of their Times and the Post.  Oh, you didn’t see the Post?  No. Why?  Oh, absolutely! You’re talented and you’re good looking.  I know! That’s why they trashed me!  Whoa. Wait a minute, wait a minute.  I, I don’t get you. I mean first, you hate me. Then you sleep with me. Then you want nothing to do with me, now you want me again.  Kate, do you even like me?  Well so, how come you blew me off? Y\\'know? How come you were with him?  Thanks.  Yeah! I stayed at Kate’s, but ah, nothing happened. Hey, Pheebs, where were ya?  Oh, it was great! Yeah, I-I walked her home, and it was amazing how much we connected, y\\'know? Then ah, then she passed out, but then she woke up. Yeah? And we stayed up all night talking, and now we’re like totally crazy about each other!  What?  You-you think?  Two brothers, one died!  Yeah?!  Sorry! Sorry, I’m late; sorry, I’m late! My duck and my chick and a fight, it-it was ugly.  Oh, ahh, go to the window. I’m wanna run down to the truck and show you something.  Hey!  Wh-wh-what’s going on? Wh-what’s this about L.A.?  But, but wh-what about us?  Well, so, stay for the museums!  Well can you at least stay to the end of the play? I mean, I’ll go to the airport with ya, I-I wanna say good bye.  I can’t! Y’know? You guys don’t know what it’s like to put yourself out there like that and just get shot down.  All right so, so what do I do?  Hey.  Hi.  So you uh, have a…big work problem?  Yeah?  Yeah?  What?! Oh my-oh my God!  What he wants to buy your baby?!  That’s crazy!  Okay, how did this even happen?  Man! When you said it was a problem about your boss and the baby I figured it was something about maternity leave.  Do you think you can just buy my friends baby?!  Not a problem. Oh, and just so you know, that guy’s not going to be bothering you about that baby thing anymore.  Let’s just say I took care of it.  Don’t worry! Don’t worry. I just told him, very nicely, \"You don’t go buying people’s babies, so back off!!\"  What?! Why?!  And you couldn’t think of anything else?!  You lied to me!  So? What-what-what happened?  I know. I know.  Hey you’re right. Yeah, it’s kinda been like us again a little bit.  Me too. I mean I…haven’t thought at all about how I put myself out there and said all that stuff and how you didn’t feel the same way about me and-and how it was really awkward.  Well, I get the medical award for separating the siamese twins. Then Amber and I go to Venezuela to meet our other half-brother, Ramone. And that\\'s where I find the world\\'s biggest emerald. It\\'s really big but it\\'s cursed.  Phoebs, check it out, check it out, check it out, check it out.  Page 42, page 42, page 42.  Ooh, I look good.  Uh, well, kinda yeah. Like, remember last week when Alex was in the accident? Well the line in the script was, \\'If we don\\'t get this woman to a hospital, she\\'s going to die.\\' But I made it, \\' If this woman doesn\\'t get to a hospital, she\\'s not gonna live.\\'  Huh? Never really thought about the writers. The scripts just kinda come to my house. But you know what? This makes me look good, which makes the show look good, which makes the writers look good so how could they be mad about that?  I fall down an elevator shaft? What the hell does this mean, I fall down an elevator shaft?  They can\\'t kill me, I\\'m Francesca\\'s long lost son.  No. No way, I\\'m not signing that.  How can they do this to me?  I don\\'t feel like talkin.  Hey.  I don\\'t know, I was kinda hopin\\' no one would ever find out.  Naa, they said that when they found my body, my brain was so smashed in that the only doctor that could have saved me was me. Supposed to be some kind of irony or somethin.  Phoebe, this was the greatest thing that ever happened to me.  No, I don\\'t. It\\'s like, ya know, you work your whole life for somethin\\' and you think that when you get it it\\'s never gonna be as good as you thought it would be. But this so was. Ya know, it changed everything. Like the other day, I got this credit card application, and I was pre- approved. Huh? I\\'ve never been pre-approved for anything in my life.  No, that means nothin to me.  I\\'m excited! I\\'ve never gotten reviewed before.  Maybe they do. I\\'ve been doin\\' this ten years and I haven\\'t gotten anywhere. There\\'s gotta be a reason.  No, no, no, it.. it\\'s too hard. It\\'s not worth it. I quit.  When I was little, I wanted to be a veteranarian, but then I found out you had to put your hands into cows and stuff.  No, I\\'m alright man. Really.  I just had a glass.  Monica, have you ever been with him when he wasn\\'t drinking?  Hey.  Yeah, my agent just called me with an audition for Days of Our Lives!  With a man?  What about Ross? I mean, are you still mad at him cause he made that list about you?  Well, I think it went pretty well. I.. I got a callback for Thursday.  No.  OK, uh.... listen, there\\'s something I want to talk to you about. The network casting lady...  Oh yeah, yeah, she\\'s great, but... I kinda got the feeling that she was sort of... coming on to me. And I definitely would get the part if I would\\'ve... you know... if I would have sent the Little General in.  Hey.  Well, the part\\'s mine if I want it.  Yeah, if I\\'m willing to sleep with the casting lady.  Ten years I\\'ve been waiting for a break like this Chandler, ten years! I mean, Days of Our Lives. That\\'s actually on television.  Well, I guess I could sleep with her... I mean, how could I do that?  I\\'ve never slept with someone for a part.  Sorry.  I just... I just don\\'t think that I want it that way though, y\\'know? I mean, let\\'s say I do make it, alright? I\\'m always gonna look back and wonder if it was because of my talent or because of.. y\\'know, the Little General.  Yeah, but after Denise DeMarco, I had to promote it.  Hey.  It was unbelievable! I walked in there and she was all over me.  Well, I couldn\\'t do it. I told her I didn\\'t want to get the part that way.  But wait, wait, wait. Then, after I left her office, she caught up with me at the elevator and offered me an even bigger part.  Soooooo... you are now looking at Dr. Drake Ramore, neurosurgeon, recurring in at least four episodes!  Hey, yeah! Then we could do that telephone thing! Y\\'know, you have a can, we have a can and it\\'s connected by a string!  What? What?  Yes, but y\\'know what? It doesn\\'t matter who knows what. Now, enough of us know that we can just tell them that we know! Then all the lying and the secrets would finally be over!  No-no-no! No-no wait Rach, you know what would even be more fun? Telling them.  I can\\'t take any…  Ugh.  Yeah?  Well I didn\\'t tell them!  Uhhh, Phoebe and Joey.  And Rachel. I would\\'ve told you but they made me promise not to tell!  I\\'m sorry! But hey, it\\'s over now, right? Because you can tell them that you know they know and I can go back to knowing absolutely nothing!  No! Not unless! Look this must end now!  I\\'m listening.  So he likes to break stuff.  Yeah, poor cat, never saw that big butt coming.  No.  They know you know.  I couldn\\'t even if I wanted too.  Ooh!  It\\'s not my first time.  Dude!  All right! So that\\'s it! It\\'s over! Everybody knows!  Oh, nothing, no. It’s an acting exercise, I’m practising my fake laugh.  What-what’s so funny?  Yeah, or-or to get a hooker.  Pheebs, he seems to enjoy it.  Well, have-have you told him how you feel?  So, we’re walking down the street and I turn to you and I say, “Hey, let’s go hang out at Totally Nude Nudes,” remember? And then, and then, you turn to me and say, “Nah, let’s just hang out at your place.” Well, that was a nice move dumb ass.  Yeah, come on, think about it. You’re 18, okay, she’s 44, when you’re 36, she’s gonna be 88.  Look, the point is, there’s a lot of women out there you haven’t even had sex with yet!  Yeah, in a poem maybe.  Now, wh-what, what is that like?  Well, I want it!  I don’t know, maybe I can’t. I mean, maybe there’s something wrong with me.  Then you hold on to it!!  I couldn’t help it, there love is so pure.  Hey!  Hey, how much cash do you got in your pocket right now?  Every night!!  Hey! You guys! You’re not gonna believe this! I just got off the phone with my agent…  Okay. I got nominated for my part on Days of Our Lives!  No-no.  No! I’m up for a Soapie!  Many are scheduled to appear.  Yeah may-maybe you don’t tell anyone about this.  Really?  What award are you practicing for?  Oh, hey listen! The Soapie’s called today and I also get to present an award.  Yeah!  Yeah. No-no I-I know I might not win, but it’s just…I’ve never even been nominated before! I want it so much.  You practice losing the Grammies too?  Ah.  Is that why you wanted to tie my tie?  Whoa!  Ross has a boyfriend.  How’d you get over that teacher?  Yeah, I got my speech!  Okay. Can I squeeze your ass?  ‘Kay!  Sure I do! It’s a verb! As in, \"I behalfin’ it!\"  But why?! I should’ve won one and I really want it and she didn’t even care enough to come to the thing! It could also be a Grammy.  Come on Rach! No one saw me take it! There was a whole table full of ‘em.  I can scratch that right off.  All right!  I’ll take it back tomorrow.  Okay wait-wait p-please be cool! Okay? I work with this woman.  Hey Jessica.  Ah, this is my friend Rachel.  Well, that-that-that’s it? You’re gonna, you’re gonna put it on your self or anything?  Oh no, I can’t go. I’m practicing; I got an audition to be the host of a new game show.  But the audition’s in a couple hours and I don’t even understand the game.  Oh really? That’d be great! You guys can be the contestants!  Yeah, isn’t that a cool name?  All right. Uhh, okay. Our first contestant is Ross Geller. Why don’t you tell us a little something about you Ross?  I said a little bit Ross. Now, how about you Chandler?  Excellent! Let’s play Bamboozled! Chandler, you’ll go first. What is the capital of Columbia?  It’s Ba-go-ta, but close enough. Now, you can either pass your turn to Ross or pick a Wicked Wango card.  I should know that. Let’s see, just one moment please. Umm, here we are, a Wicked Wango card determines whether you go higher or lower.  All right Ross you’re in the lead, would you like to take another question or spin the Wheel of Mayhem?  Okay, this is gonna be tough. Hold your breath.  No dude, you gotta hold your breath until you’re ready to answer the question.  Okay, what do you have a fear of if you suffer from this phobia, Tris…Holy cow, that’s a big word. Trisc… Seriously look at this thing. Chandler, how do you say that?  No! No, fear of the number 13.  All right Chandler, you’re up.  All right. Chandler, you can either spin the wheel or pick a Google card.  You-you must choose Mr. Bing.  Choose, you jackass!  Okay, you picked the Gimmie card! You get all of Ross’s points!  Correct! There’s a possible backwards bonus!  Yes!  Wise choice, how many rungs?  Yes! Yes, you’re back in the lead!  All right! All right! Uh, umm, Super-Speedy Speed round!  Of course!  Who invented bifocals?  Correct! Which monarch has ruled Great Britain the longest?  Correct again! But, you forgot to switch legs between questions, so no hopping bonus!  Now, over to Chandler.  Are you sure?  Oh my God! Congratulations Ross, because Chandler, you’ve been Bamboozled!  Correct! Now, would you like to pick a Wicked Wango card or spin the Wheel of Mayhem?  What—Why?!  Well what’s complicated? You spin the Wheel of Mayhem to go up the Ladder of Chance. You go past the Mud Hut through the Rainbow Ring to get to the Golden Monkey; you yank his tail and boom! You’re in Paradise Pond!  Well what’s fun about that? You expect me to be the host of a boring game that’s just people standing around answering questions?  Well anyway, I\\'m glad you\\'re back, I really need your help.  I have an audition for this play and for some of it I have to speak French. Which, according to my résumé, I\\'m fluent in.  Well, so, will you help me? I really wanna be in this play.  Je de coup Clow.  Ok.  Je depli mblue.  Really? It sounds exactly the same to me.  Yeah.  Got it.  Je te flouppe Fli.  Oh, de fuff!  Hey.

Je do call blue!  je.  mah  pel.  je.  mah  pel.  Me pooh pooh!  What are you doing?  Huh, un, blu, bla, flu, flenk!  Thank you.  Hey!  Oh, no, that\\'s okay, I don\\'t need your help.

Pfoof!  Sa-sa-saw!  Ah. All right. But my French was good?  Yeah-hah. Toute-de-le-fruit.  No.  No.  Would fall off a lot.  That I can do.  Uh, ah, Monica\\'s pregnant?!  Oh, that\\'s cool. We have interns at \\'Days Of Our Lives\\'.  I don\\'t know, but it sounds great.  With Lennart Haze?  Oh my god, that is great! That is *** for a play on broadway… and in a real theatre, not that little one underneath the dally like last time.  Well, it must be, because I read and I didn\\'t understand a singe word.  Yeah, yeah, and directing.  Yeah, he\\'s done some amazing works.  Tell me about it! \"Unlimited nights and weekends!\"  No, I-I-I wasn\\'t making fun of you, honestly, I-I think you were great in those commercials.  Yeah.  Wow!  Oh, yah, sure.  Err, \"I think you know\".  \"I am what you made me. You know what? I could go right now.\"  \"I can\\'t. Oh, I want to, long pause, but I can\\'t.\"  Yeah.  I really doubt that.  Well, he said I wasn\\'t urgent enough, you know, and that everything I did was horizontal and I should be more vertical. Oh, and he said that I should think less.  Hey, that\\'d work on me! Why did I get to buy Mrs. Butterwords?  But I\\'m bursting with u-hu!  Actually, I really need…  \"I am what you made me! You know what?\"  \"I could go right now.\"  Probably wanna know what I\\'m doing…?  Yesterday at my audition, I really had to pee, and apparently, having to pee makes me a really good actor. I got a call-back, so I\\'m drinking everything. Oh, by the way, that egg nog in our fridge was great!  \"You know!\"  \"I need an answer now!\"  \"You knew this all along and you never told me? You never told me? I can never forgive you, I can never forgive myself, I have nothing to live for – Bang – End Scene!\"  Hey guys!  Sure.  Would you guys want to come down tomorrow and watch me tape the show?  Seriously?  Ahaha, he might as well just give us the points.  A spoon. Your hands. Your face!  Paper, snow, a ghost!  A rock, a dog, the earth.  Salami, anchovies, jam!  Paper, snow, a ghost!  Chickens?  Oh!  Ketchup!  Relish!  Oh.  Yeah...  Oh, so we didn\\'t win, but it\\'s fun to play the game, right?  Oh, wow! I\\'m so sorry, ok? I promise, we\\'ll do better next time!  I-I-I don\\'t know. Types of trees?  Things that go \"tssst\" when you put them out.  Things that burn.  Dude, dude! I think you\\'re losing it.  Oh, oh, oh... What a dog says.  Girls Chandler could never get?  Hey!  Aww, I don\\'t know Monica y\\'know... erm... lending friends money is always a mistake.  And I think he would tell you it was a mistake.  Oh...how much?  Two thousand dollars!? What do you think I am? I soap opera star!?  Oo...what\\'s in the bag?  Oh...baby-proofing... Why is this such a big deal now? Y\\'know, when I was a kid it was like.. \"Whoops! Joey fell down the stairs!\" or er.. \"Whoops! Joey electrocuted himself again!\" Huh!  You\\'re gonna do it?  Oh, women can. You can\\'t.  The hardware store is right down the street.  Hey!  I thought you didn\\'t have secrets from Monica.  Yeah, I know.  Err... I just figured it out! You know, I mean you\\'re not working and the economy is bad.  Oh! Sure! How much? Two thousand dollars?  Err... Kind of.  Oh no no no no no... It wasn\\'t... It wasn\\'t because of your money problems, it was for something for her.  Something personal.  Boob job.  Well it\\'s...It\\'s not that crazy okay? Making them smaller, that would be crazy.  Because she is!  Mmmm hmm! For your boob job!  OK so I\\'m out four thousand dollars and nobody\\'s boobs are getting any bigger?  Hey uh, where do you guys want this?  Hey! You made it!  You’re ready to have a baby? My boy’s all grown up!  God. He’s crazy! Why doesn’t he want to be with Rachel?  Come on you stupid machine! Come on!  All right.  Hey I got one! I got one!  Remoray. It’s Portuguese. We need that information; I’m a doctor.  Damnit woman we’re losing precious time! Now do you want this man’s blood on your head?  Hands! It is absolutely essential that you tell me what room the man my assistant described is staying in. He’s a patient of mine, I’ve been treating him for years!  816, thank you!  And what is his name?  Great! Go get him.  But you said he was this great guy!  You do attract some stinkers.  Hi! I’m Dr. Drake Remoray and I have a few routine questions I need to ask you.  I know, but I’m a neurologist. And just to be on the safe side, Dr. Wells wanted a more comprehensive overview of you status so he sent me.  That was a test. Good response. All right, full name.  Date of birth?  Age?  I’m a doctor Cliff, not a mathematician.  Okay. And uh, are you married.  Oh really? So, 33 and still single, would you say you have commitment issues?  Oh that’s terrible. I’m-I’m really sorry.  Hmm. Do you sleep with women and never call them again?  Excellent! Excellent! And uh, finally, are you into any weird stuff y’know, sexually?  Uh, well he’s 33.  A widower.  He seemed like a stand up guy. Oh, and he’s not into anything weird sexually.  Uh, if I may? Umm-umm look, Cliff, you told me a lot of personal stuff about you, right? And maybe-maybe it would if-if would help if-if you knew some personal stuff about her. Uh, she was married to a gay ice dancer. Uh, she gave birth to her brother’s triplets. Oh! Oh! Her-her twin sister used to do porn!  Right!  Me neither.  There she is!  Oh no-no, no for I second there I counted six fingers, but one was from the other hand so we’re good.  What’s the matter now?  What was the other one Ross?  What is it? Hey!  Rach come on, what?  What are you talking about alone? What about Ross?  Okay, how long was I watching that woman?  Yeah, I guess so.  Hey, listen to me, listen to me…you are never ever gonna be alone. Okay? I promise that’s not gonna happen.  You don’t have to worry about that okay?  Sure.  My God.  Boy, that guy\\'s underwear sucks!  I got this pair marked excess, I gotta tell ya, there was no room for excess anything in there.  Nope. Op, wait! There he goes.  This is your place?  Ugh!!  Did you tell the guy you wanted to have sex with his wife and then fall right out of your chair?  What happened?  You kissed him?!  I bet that kiss isn\\'t looking like such a big mistake now, is it?  Damnit!! Did you move?!  Because it\\'s impossible to find her apartment! She lives in some like of hot girl parallel universe, or something.  No. No. No. She lives on the third floor, eighth apartment from the left.  Hey Monica, why are we watchin\\' the business channel?  Freaky.  Monica, relax, go get a beer.  Who said it was for you?  You\\'re kiddin\\'.  Hey, woah, let\\'s go down there and get your hat back.  Do what?  See, didn\\'t I tell ya these pillows would be a good idea?  Yeah good luck, good luck.  Hey Rach, you uh, you want some sandwich?  Olive loaf and ham spread, no mayo.  Get him a bone, get a bone. You gotta bone?  Well why don\\'t you just reach out and take his trampoline.  Hey, hey, hey no.  Well if he\\'s not gonna eat it, I will.  Hey Phoeb\\'s, I think you\\'re good to go.  Yeah, whatever you need. Hey, you wanna go home?  Uhh, I\\'m guessing the threshold\\'s clear now.  Yeah, you missed, \\'Takes money to make money,\\' and uh, \\'Don\\'t make me come down there and kick your wall street butt.\\'  Well uh, I had breakfast here so technically I saved $3.50.  How come those?  That is so not my motto.  Good.  Hey Phoebs, if you want, I\\'ll do it.  Yeah really, Ross, have you ever been beaten up before?  By someone besides Monica?  He-he-he, how\\'s it goin\\'?  Excellent.  Hey!  Hey, if you wanna grab a bite before work we\\'d better get acrimonious. No? Am I getting close?  Heeey!  Come on in, how are ya?  Can I offer you a drink?  Yeah, definitely, definitely. Ok, what do you wanna see first?  I know, yeah!  Ok, let me stop you right there. The Mets suck, ok? You wanna see the Yankees.  Which one, they all suck!  Ross!  I need to talk to you about Charlie.  Yeah, I\\'m... I\\'m kind of having a little problem.  No, look, you know Charlie, right? She\\'s cool, she\\'s funny, her body is soo...  Yes. It\\'s just that she\\'s so much smarter than all the girls I\\'ve ever dated! Combined! I don\\'t want her to think I\\'m stupid!  Right, right, right, well, she wants to go to all this cultural places and I don\\'t know how to talk about that stuff. You gotta help me out!  Please, c\\'mon, you\\'re the smartest person I know and I really like this girl, ok, I don\\'t wanna lose her.  Thanks.  The Metsss!  Ok, all right, so I\\'ll take her to the MET.  Geez, sounds like you should be going on this date!  Whoa, whoa, whoa! Slow down, you go way too fast. Ok? Just go back to the MET, ok?  You got to tell me exactly what to do there.  Ok.  Ah! I\\'m an actor! I can memorize anything! Last week on \"Days\" I had to say \"Frontal temporal zygomatic craniotomy\".  No idea! But the guy I said it to dies in the next scene so I guess it means \"you\\'re gonna get eaten by a bear\".  Hey!  Thank you.  So what\\'re you going to do?  How about Tony\\'s? If you can finish a 32-ounce steak, it\\'s free.  I\\'m telling you, that monkey is a chick magnet! She\\'s going to take one look at his furry, cute little face and it\\'ll seal the deal.  It\\'s creamier.  I don\\'t know. We\\'re talking about whipped fish, Monica. I\\'m just happy I\\'m keeping it down, y\\'know?  Uh-oh.  What\\'s the big deal? You just say what you want to do to her. Or what you want her to do to you. Or what you think other people might be doing to each other. I\\'ll tell you what. Just try something on me.  Why not? Come on! Just, just close your eyes and tell me what you\\'d like to be doing right now.  ....yeah... what else?  Alright, now you say something.  Come on! You like this woman, right?  You want to see her again, right?  Well if you can\\'t talk dirty to me, how\\'re you going to talk dirty to her? Now tell me you want to caress my butt!  There you go! Keep going. Keep going!  Say it... say it!  You\\'re not going to believe this!  Hey Chandler, while you were sleeping that guy from your old job called again.  What a tool!  All right, Ross!  You cuddled.  Yeah, where the hell is he?  Hey, is that when you wrote salt water taffy man?  Oh no, what happened?  Yeah, I\\'ve had it.  But don\\'t you need experience for a job like that?  Oh yeah yeah. I process. People want the processing, I\\'m the one they call.  Uhh, well, right now I\\'m in between things. You know how it is. One day you\\'re processing, the next day you\\'re not so much... processing any more.  Hey.  Pretty good. It\\'s like you said. It\\'s mostly just putting numbers from one column into another column.  Hey and everbody is so nice. I just had a good talk with that lady with the red hair, Jeannie.  Yeah, turns out our kids go to the same school. Small world huh?  I figure my character has kids.  Well, see when you\\'re acting you need to think about stuff like that. My character, Joseph the processor guy, has two little girls, Ashley and Brittany. Ashley copies everything Brittany does.  Yeah. Joseph and his wife, Karen, are thinking of having a third kid... Ya know what? Just did.  You and Milton have to join us on the boat. Karen\\'ll pack a lunch, you\\'ll bring the kids, we\\'ll make a day of it.  Oh, thanks, thanks. Bye bye Jeannie.  What a phony.  Sir.  Yeah Bing, what\\'s that about?  This company was not built on rough numbers. Am I right Mr. Douglas.  Joseph\\'s good, isn\\'t he?  Hey, hey, I just figure Joseph\\'s the kinda guy that likes to mix it up. Ya know, get in there, ruffle some feathers.  Look, I\\'m sorry but that\\'s what Joseph does, ok. If you try to pull somethin\\', he\\'ll call you on it. \\'What\\'re you tryin\\' to pull,\\' he\\'ll say.  Hey. Mr. Douglas is looking for you.  \\'Cause he has a strong suspicion that you dropped the ball on the Lender project.  Becasue at first he thought it was Joseph. But after he asked Joseph about it, turns out it was you. Anyway, I just thought you should know.  What\\'re you talking about, everybody loves Joseph.  Oh yeah. Well you can\\'t fire Joseph. You know why, \\'cause he\\'s not in your department.  Karen.  Ahh. What the hell are you doing to me man.  Really?  Take it easy. If it means that much to you, I\\'ll uh, I\\'ll go find something else.  Hi everyone.  Well, Chandler\\'s old roomate was Jewish, and these are the only candles we have, so... Happy Chanukah, everyone.  What\\'s up man?  OK... my weirdest place would have to be... the women\\'s room on the second floor of the New York CIty public library.  We have a winner!  It\\'s never gonna happen.  You and Rachel.  Because you waited too long to make your move, and now you\\'re in the friend zone.  Ross, you\\'re mayor of the zone.  Priesthood! Look Ross, I\\'m telling you, she has no idea what you\\'re thinking. If you don\\'t ask her out soon you\\'re going to end up stuck in the zone forever.  Are you going to do it?  Do you want any help?  Good luck, man.  Hey, where are you going?  You can\\'t go out there.  Because of... the reason.  I, um, can\\'t tell you.  OK, you\\'ve got to promise that you\\'ll never, ever tell Ross that I told you.  He\\'s planning your birthday party.  Hey, don\\'t look at me. This is Ross\\'s thing.  Sorry, that was wax.  Hey Ross. This probably isn\\'t the best time to bring it up, but you have to throw a party for Monica.  Hey.  What are you doing?  Rach, there is a decent place to…  No. No. No.  No. Rosita does not move.  As in Rosita does not move.  The big deal is that it is the exact equal distance from the bathroom to the kitchen and it’s at the perfect angle so you don’t get any glare coming of off Stevie.  I told you not to move it! Rach, how would you feel if say, I wanted to move you mom, and you said don’t, and I did it anyway and her head fell off?  That’s true.  No I won’t.  Because, I know what I like and what I don’t like! It’s not the same thing!  I don’t know why you say that so soon.  Francette? What is she? A couch?  Poor thing. Cut down in her prime.  No it’s not weird, it’s a miracle!  Oh there is! If you want something enough and your heart is pure, wondrous things can happen!  Miracle!  Someone like an…angel?  Fine.  No. Really?  Your chair?!  So, there was no miracle?!  How do you figure?  That’s right!  Yeah! We are!  Oh yeah.  Hey!  Hey. So where\\'s Mon?  And you\\'re not helping?  You damn right I am, I\\'ve been waiting for a cookie for 7 minutes.  Yeah, you too.  How do you think she\\'s doing?  Man, I wish I had a nanny like you.  Sure.  Why not?  Oh, man, why did have to go and say that for? Now that you told me I can\\'t have it makes me want her even more!  Yes!  For a walk.  Actually, that will be long. You know, I really need to organize my thoughts.  Allright, fine, I only have one thought! It\\'s about the hot nanny, I gotta see her!  Now YOU\\'RE telling me I can\\'t see her?? You guys are killing me! She\\'s forbidden fruit! It\\'s like ... like she\\'s the princess and I\\'m the stable boy ... Why are you doing this, huh? Did Ross tell you not to let me go over there?  Huh. Interesting. Now there are obstacles. Hot nanny and me against the world. This is the kind of stuff great novels are made of.  Fine ... mediocre porn  Hey Rach, so can I sing happy birthday to you now?  So you see, Molly, what people don\\'t understand is that acting is a discipline. It takes a lot of hard work.  Oh, I didn\\'t go to college.  Molly ... people don\\'t study acting ...  Yeah, they\\'re mine.  Yeah, it was! All right, listen, I can\\'t…  Oh-oh, yeah-yeah, I bet all the sex makes it easier!  Didn\\'t think so.  Hey, Pheebs!  What\\'s wrong buddy?  I\\'m surprised you didn\\'t go home wearing your lunch.  So you uh, still wondering?  You\\'re smart. I like that.  Oh no-no-no-no, wait-wait-wait!!  Hiya.  You guys promised you\\'d be more careful! I mean, come on! The good Joey name is being dragged through the mud here!  Well, I\\'m telling everyone about you! That\\'s the only way to explain the underwear and the video camera that doesn\\'t make me look like a pig!  Yeah, I like that. But no-no, how does that explain why Rachel found my underwear at your place?  Well, get ready to come out of the non-gay closet!  Oh no-no-no! No-no-no-no-no-no-no!  No! I am not a pervert! Okay? It\\'s just… I just… Kinda…  Thank you!  No! No! I am not a sex addict!  No it isn\\'t! No, it\\'s not. Because you can also explain it with the truth!  Uh yes, but it was, we just did it once uh, in London.  Of course it\\'s true! How else would you explain all the weird stuff that\\'s been going on?  Ahh—oy! That was the underwear I was wearing that night in London. Right Monica?  No! If anyone\\'s a sex addict here, it\\'s Monica! Yeah. Yeah. She has been trying to get me back in the sack ever since London!  That makes sense!  Uhh, Monica?  But sadly I could not be enticed.  No!  No!  Nooo!  Yes!!  Yes that’s the one about the soldiers who fight in World War I!  Well anyway, the guy they wanted backed out and now they want me! I start shooting today!  Oh no, I’ll be done by then.  I know! All right, I’ll see you guys over there! I’m off to fight the Nazis.  I’m doing my scenes with you?  Wow! I can’t believe this! This is incredible. I mean you just won an Oscar!  I think you did.  Uh…Cookie?  We have to find the rest of the platoon!  Hey! Where have you been?  Oh.  Yeah.  Thanks. Yeah, I figure if I wear these in my scenes at least I won’t get spit in the eyes, y’know?  Oh man! They-they just redid my make-up!  All right.  Picture? What picture?  Okay uh, look I know you’re a great actor, okay? And you play all those Shakespeare guys and stuff…  But you’re spittin’ all over me man!  You know you’ve been spitting on me?!  What picture?!  You went through my personal property?  Great scene yeah?  Thanks a lot.  Oh, I’m-I’m not working tomorrow.  I’m having surgery!  Yeah, I-I just made up the stuff about the wedding because I didn’t want you to worry about me. But, I’m having surgery today.  Transplant.  Hair transplant.  It’s not on my head.  Hey! You’re here! Great! Great! Great! Let’s get going buddy, we’ve got a scene to shoot!  Are you drunk?  Yes you are!  I would sooner die in this hellhole then see her back with you!  What?! He got me! Owwwwww!!!  Look, my best friends are getting married in like an hour. Okay? And I’m the minister. Please! Please! Can you pull it together?  Thank you. Thank you.  I would sooner die in this hellhole then see her back with you!  Damnit!  I’m still on the set!  I know! I’m sorry! The guy’s drunk, they won’t let me go until we get this.  No! No, I’m the minister! All right, look-look, put ‘em both on the phone, I’ll marry them right now.  Hey! Don’t you hang up on me! I’ll marry you and me right now! I have the power!  Aaron! You gotta let me go. The guy’s hammered!  So I uh, I just talked to the director. That’s it, we’re done for the day.  Yeah! You…you were wonderful.  So I got your car, it’s right outside.  That’s what you told me.  Chandler?  You may not kiss the bride. So, I guess by the powers vested in my by the state of New York and the Internet guys, I now pronounce you husband and wife. Oh wait! Do you take each other?  Yeah you do!  Aw crap! Okay—uh…uh let’s-let’s do the rings.  Hey, hey.  Yes, I am. As of today, I am officially Joey Tribbiani, actor slash model.  You know those posters for the city free clinic?  Thanks.  Yeah.  Uh, hi. We uh, we used to work together.  I gotta tell you. You\\'re the best in the business.  I\\'m serious. You\\'re amazing. You know when to spritz, when to lay back.  Ooh, you smell great tonight. What\\'re you wearing?  Listen, uh, you wanna go get a drink or something?  What\\'s wrong?  Oh. What?  Wait, wait, wait!  So I guess you all saw it.  Set another place for Thanksgiving. My entire family thinks I have VD.  Chandler, will you just come in already?  Hey, Monica, I got a question. I don\\'t see any tater tots.  But my mom always makes them. It\\'s like a tradition. You get a little piece of turkey on your fork, a little cranberry sauce, and a tot! It\\'s bad enough I can\\'t be with my family because of my disease.  The balloon?  Wait, wait, we have a copy of your key.  That tone will not make me go any faster.  That one will.  Nope, not that one.  Hey, I got one keyhole and about a zillion keys. You do the math.  Hey, we all had better plans. This was nobody\\'s first choice.  You call that delicious?  I\\'ve gotta see this. All right Ugly Naked Guy!  Oh, I will.  The bigger half.  Whoa, I didn’t know we could date your sister!  I can’t believe Ross went out with Rachel’s sister! When Chandler made out with my sister I was mad at him for 10 years.  Yeah you got 5 years left!  You wanna make it 6?!  Come on man there’s gotta be something that gets you choked up! Like uh, uh oh, what if you saw a three-legged puppy?  Okay, what if the puppy said, \"Help me Chandler. All the other puppies pick on me.\"  No! It’s not okay! It’s not okay at all!! You’re dead inside!!  Oh, you’re Phoebe’s fan!  Movies?  Hey Gunther, don’t let that guy in here anymore! He just said Phoebe’s a porn star!  Uhhh, yeah. Yeah. But uh, I don’t think it’s the kind you’re gonna like.  Sort of…  Well down at the adult video place down on Bleaker.  All right well, I’d better take that back.  We can’t watch that! I mean that’s Phoebe!  No! Hey no! This is wrong you guys! Phoebe’s our friend! Well, I’m not gonna watch it!  Yeah.  Re! Re! Then I can watch that! Rewind it! Rewind it!  Hey!  Oh no, not you too!  Nice!  That’s great, but isn’t it gonna bother that people still think you’re a porn star?  You do?  Yeah.  Hey.  Nooo. I had a story all worked out but then Chandler sold me out.  What is this? Fruit?  This will just be my batch.  Remember when you where a kid and your Mom would drop you off at the movies with a jar of jam and a little spoon?  Put your hands together.  No more jam?!  Check it out!! Jam crackers!  Yeah, the Knicks rule!  Noooo, that\\'s what I was wearing when I donated. I\\'m kinda surprised there\\'s any of my boys left.  Maybe, I should call this place and get them to put my \\'Days of Our Lives\\' on here. You know, juice this puppy up a little.  Orrr, you could follow him and see where he goes.  Hey.  Where you going?  Sperm or regular?  So you\\'re really doing this, huh?  Sounds nice.  No kiddin\\', hmm.  No, I-I figured you would\\'ve picked a blond guy.  I don\\'t know, I just always pictured you ending up with one of those tall, smart blond guys, name like.... Hoyt.  It\\'s a name, yeah. I saw you, you know, in this great house with a big pool.  He\\'s got the body for it.  You guys have one of those signs that says: \\'We don\\'t swim in your toilet, so don\\'t pee in our pool.\\', you know.  Sure you do, it was a gift from me. Oh! And you have these three great kids.  Yeah!  Hey, so, uh, how’s it going living over at Ross’?  Bye.  There’s one lucky to-go cup of coffee.  Thanks. But maybe later.  You know what I want? I want a lot of things! I want to be with the woman I love on Valentine’s Day! And I want her to love me back! And I want just one moment of relief from the gut-wrenching pain of knowing that that’s never going to happen!  Oh, okay.  No, I’m not sleeping with your friend Jane again.  Hey! A dog! Hi! Who, you got to admit, looks a lot like Jane.  Hi.  Oh, that’s, uh, that’s Phoebe’s friend’s dog. I don’t know what his real name is, but I call him Mozzarella.  So, between her and me being friends, and her history with Ross, it just isn’t going to happen. It would be like you falling in love with a cat.  Hey.  No.  Nothing. We just talked about stuff.  Rachel stuff.  He’s breathing!  Hey, what’s up?  Oh, man, I’m sorry. Why?  Still, that really sucks, man. Especially on Valentine’s Day.  Sort of.  You don’t have to seem so happy about it.  Oh, I…I d—  Forget about it. It’s no big deal.  It’s nothing.  No!  Yes.  Sometimes I think maybe she could. But it doesn’t matter, because I can’t do anything about it.  Well, it’s complicated. She’s with this other guy. For a long time. Someone from work, too. And I could never do that to the guy, because we’re really good friends.  No. I don’t think so.  Yeah, he’s the best.  Oh, I don’t know.  I do! So much! I can’t stop thinking about her! I can’t sleep, I—  Oh, yeah.  It’s Rachel.  Hey, great! All right!  Well, it comes and goes. I wouldn\\'t trust it.  No, no, no. My hugs are reserved for people STAYING IN AMERICA.  Hey Phoebe.  I’m just mad at my agent.  There’s a part in a TV movie that I would be perfect for and I didn’t even be put up for it! She’d better have a good reason.  Ok. Why?  I love that saying!  Hello?  I was just gonna call you! That’s weird.  Yeah, actually I am!  That’s it? You know, it seems all you do lately is drop the ball.  No, no, look. All I’m saying is that you’re my agent, ok? And you’re not getting me into any auditions and I’m tired of it.  Yeah, I just… I just feel bad about firing Estelle. This is got to be killing her.  I don’t know. She’s got to be taking it hard, I was like her only client. Except for this guy who eats paper. And I’m guessing he eats more money than he makes. Look, I know she’s not a great agent, but she did stick with me for ten years. I’m gonna call her and hire her again.  Why?  Estelle?  Can I ask you something? Uhm, what\\'s it like there?  Ahhhhhh, I didn\\'t get the job.  I dunno. Some fat guy\\'s sleeping with the store manager. He\\'s not even jolly, it\\'s all political.  Ah, I\\'m gonna be one of his helpers. It\\'s just such a slap in the face, y\\'know?  Hey, that guy\\'s going home with more than a note!  Hi. Hi, sorry I\\'m late.  You know more than one Fun Bobby?  Ooh ooh ooh ooh, there\\'s no room for milk!  Uh, four.  Yeah, and I met this really hot single mom at the store. What\\'s an elf to do?  Wow, that\\'s, uh, dirty.  Hey, kids...  There y\\'go, kids.  You seen Sandy?  Looks like that no date pact thing worked out.  Nonono, you can\\'t kiss Ross, that\\'s your brother.  All right!  Hey!  I’m sending back all this stuff that Chandler bought out of guilt.  No! I’m putting that in my room.  Back when you and Rachel were together, if Chandler had kissed her, would you hear him out?  Five years.  Hey! Don’t do the crime if you can’t do the time.  No, was my best friend. Anyway, I don’t know why you’re pushing for him so hard. With him out of the way as my best friend, there’s a spot open.  Yeah!  What?  All right. But if you weren’t my best friend.  My folks.  I don’t know. I might stay there for a few days while I look for an apartment.  Yeah, y’know at first I thought we could talk about this y’know, work it out, but uh, seeing you two together I don’t think I…  Yeah! You did! And that’s why I’m leaving.  When that guy was robbing us, and I was locked in the entertainment unit for like six hours, you know what I was doing in there all that time? I was thinking about how I let you down!  Yeah! But if would’ve know what kind of friend you were gonna turn out to be, I wouldn’t have worried about it so much! See you around!  Ewwwww!! Ew! Ew! Ew!  He’s fine!  Chandler?  Hey!  He’s doin’ some thinkin’!  You kissed my girlfriend!  That doesn’t sound like thinking to me!  Y’know I don’t think you should be talking at all in there! I think you’ve got to much thinking to do to be talking and making jokes!  All right, look! If this is just a big joke to you, then forget about it, all right?! This means something to me! And if it doesn’t mean anything to you, then you should get out of there, otherwise you’re just an idiot in a box!  So are you gonna start taking this thing seriously?  Hey.  That’s okay. Chandler’s the one I’m mad at.  In the box.  Yeah, we’re gonna be fine! Get out!  Yeah, you did some real good thinkin’ in there.  All right, who got Chandler? ‘Cause I uh, need to trade.  Uhh, that’s not them. I’m gonna go call the police.  Hey-hey-hey, hey that’s your wife you’re talking about!  Who was that?  You hung up on the pizza place? I don’t hang up on your friends.  Oh, what’s wrong?  Then why did I ask?  Is that college talk for horny?  Good, I uh, I saw a pretty big pigeon.  Yeah, I gotta, I gotta go to my room too.  You’re Rachel!  You’re my friend!  But plus, it would be wrong and weird and-and-and bad.  I know!  Do you wanna do it?  All right, me neither! I was just testing you!  This conversation never happened!  Good night!  Well, neither.  All right. Okay. You and Monica, friends for a long time, and sure there are rules, but then you went to London. Oh, no, but that’s different. I mean, there are rules there, too! You know what I mean?  It was different for you guys! I mean, I mean, you were both in the same place, right?  Yeah.  You know what? This is a bad idea. Forget it. Forget it, and listen, do me a favor, this conversation was between you and me.  Hey. Well, what’s up?  What?  Whaaat?  Oh my God. You do?  I know. I know. And this is so much more complicated than it was for those guys. I mean, it’s Rachel for God sakes.  I know. I know. And she’s not only my friend; she’s my pregnant friend! She’s my pregnant friend who’s Ross’ ex!  What am I going to do? You know, and I keep, I keep trying to get rid of these feelings, y’know? I stayed up all last night and made a list of everything I don’t like about her. You want to hear it?  She made me switch to light Mayo. That’s it! That’s all I got! And, you know what? It tastes the same and my pants fit better!  You think?  Yeah, just a crush! That’s all this is! It’s a crush! I’m Joey; I don’t get deep feelings.  Not really.  Why?  Okay.  If you want I could loan you some money?  Oh, hey, how about this? Wanna be an extra on my show?  Yeah, yeah. The pay is pretty good and you could do it for as long as you need.  Okay, now. I gotta tell you, being on TV isn\\'t as glamorous and exciting as you think.  No it is awesome!  She sure does. Why does she have a pink bow taped to her head?  Yes you are. I think it may be time for my sponge bath. Sorry, I\\'m just so used to hitting on the extras. So, are you excited about your scene?  Oh, relax. Don\\'t be. You\\'ll be fine, you\\'ll be fine. They\\'ll probably just make you stand in the back.  Hey.  Well, he can be a little rough around the edges, so I\\'m gonna replace a word he used a lot, with the word \"puppy.\" Okay, so he said: \"If your puppy friend doesn\\'t get her puppy act together, I\\'m gonna fire her mother-puppy ass.\"  That\\'s right, you\\'re not. You\\'re a nurse. You\\'re Nurse With Tray.  No, no. Nurse With Tray doesn\\'t know Joey, she doesn\\'t have time for friends. She gets in that operating room and she carries that tray to the doctor, because if she doesn\\'t, people die!  Okay.  Oh, sometimes we use the same extras for different parts. It\\'s okay.  Maybe you are a nurse, but you moonlight as a waitress.  Nice.  No, no. See, you and Drake are having a fight.  He slept with you and then never called you.  Oh, calm down! She means on the show! We need some new extras around here!  Please don\\'t fire my friend. Just let me talk to her.  Thank you, thank you. How about I do something for you? Tomorrow, I\\'ll bring you a hat, cover up the bald?  Hey, listen Pheebs. I was just talking to the director, and he was thinking, maybe this time you don\\'t hit Drake, you just wait on the tables?  You\\'re a masseuse. You have a table with a hole in it.  What?  Probably kill myself!  Hey, if Little Joey\\'s dead, then I got no reason to live!  You are? Ross, I\\'m sorry..  ...Ninety-five, ninety-six, ninety-seven. See, I told you! Less than a hundred steps from our place to here.  So?  What\\'s wrong with the twentieth?  The hell with hockey, let\\'s all do that!  C\\'mon, Ross!  Oh, you\\'re fine, yeah, for a first job.  What?  -Peaches?  C\\'mon, sit. Just sit down, sit.  Well, how long do you think it\\'ll be?  He\\'s right, enough, already. What is the big deal about today? So you slept with her for the first time, so what? You slept with her for seven years after that.  What?  Whoah, boy, hockey was a big mistake! There was a whole bunch of stuff we could\\'ve done tonight!  Man. Can you believe he\\'s only had sex with one woman?  Really?  Oh, ah- the kid has it.  Ha-ha, very funny. I don’t know what to do! Y’know? Holy crud!  Hey and, this is a little extra something for y’know, always being there for me.  Oh! Ooh-ooh!  You’re still a tiny bit on fire there.  Mornin’  I mean what kind of an actor, what kind of an actor can’t even say, \"Hmm, noodle soup?\"  Nothin’.  Oh yeah, and she’s really nice too! She taught me about y’know, how to work with the cameras and smell-the-fart acting.  You’re still a tiny bit on fire there!  Do we have to know about that?  I\\'m gonna be in the waitin\\' room, handing out cigars.  Oh, yeah.  Oh yeah? And who do you like?  The Celtics? Ha. They couldn\\'t hit a boat if...wait. They suck, alright?  Wha? Wha..aa? Let me get the father. Hey, we need a father over here! We need a father!  Oh, oh, oh, sorry.  Oh, uh, ok. Right this way. All the other pregnant women seem to be goin\\' in here.  Tribbiani.  Yeah, so, uh, so, uh, what\\'s the deal with this father guy, I mean, if someone was havin\\' my baby somewhere, I\\'d wanna know about it, you know?  Ok, look, maybe I should just go.  Good luck, and uh, take care, huh?  You know what the Celtics problem is? They let the players run the team.  Oh, it is.  It is.  Ew! What is that? Something exploded!  Oh, just had a baby.  Relax. You\\'re only at nine centimeters. And the baby\\'s at zero station.  Ben, Ben, hey Ben. Nothing. I don\\'t think that\\'s his name.  He doesn\\'t do much, does he?  Oh okay, okay! One more push! One more push! Come on honey, we’re almost there! We’re almost there!  Oh, I love you too.  What? What’s going on?  Aaaah…  Really?!  Oh, y’know what? Maybe uh, you…you should come to me. I’m a not, I’m not wearing any bottoms.  Oh my, oh my God!  Mia Hamm?  Whoa-hey-oh! Sorry!  Hey Ross! The baby’s kicking!  A dreamless sleep.  Wow! Can I get a copy of that?  Whoa, Monica runs a pretty tight ship over here. What are you doing?  Why not?  I don’t know. Ooh, I bet it’s Richard.  Well off the top of my head uhh, maybe she’s having her cake and eating it too. You being the cake and Richard being the too. Or!  Oh hey whoa-whoa, don’t worry. Okay. When my sisters were pregnant they got every weird feeling in the book, it was always nothing.  Absolutely. But, we’re gonna stop by the hospital just to be sure, okay? I’ll page Ross on the way. Come on.  Hey! So?  So but everything is normal.  And-and there’s no danger to her and the baby?  Calm?! I wasn’t calm! I’ve never been more scared in all my life!  Well what do I know?! I’m not a doctor!  You sure?!  Something called Braxton-Hicks contractions.  Hey uh, what’s with the candy?  Oh hey, don’t worry about it man. Don’t worry about it, no big deal.  Easy there Captain Kirk. Oh, do you have a bobby pin?  Then why do you throw like one?  Sure. \"Monica.\"  Yeah.  Oh, I just…I feel terrible.  What’s going on?  Pickle? Pickles make her sick. Giving her pickles is like giving me salad.  Dude relax! It could happen to anyone.  Hey uh, can I, can I talk to you guys for a second?  Uh, sit down. I wanna talk about our situation.  Maybe you two should live together.  Oh no-no, no-no I love living with you. It just seems that…if you’re gonna have a roommate, y’know it might as well be the father.  All right now, so? What do you think?  Well, I was due.  Hey.  Well uh, I wanted to have a few beers, but uh, I got rid of those because Rachel couldn’t stand the smell of them. But I have thrown back a lot of orange juice with calcium though. And uh, it’s a couple weeks past it’s expiration date, so it’s got a bit of a kick.  Saw the Porsche out there Mon, lookin’ good. When do I get to take that baby out again?  Yeah, you got a couple hours?  Hey!  So! You and Phoebe huh? How long have you been going out?  Wow! Maybe uh, maybe you and I ought to get to know each other a little better.  So uh, what’s your name?  Me too! There’s a game on Tuesday do you wanna go?  Pheebs!  Listen, you know how uh, when you’re wearing pants and you lean forward I check out your underwear?  Well, when Jake did it I saw that…he was wearing women’s underwear!  That’s weird!  That’s…kinda hot.  Yeah, I wouldn’t know about that.  Yeah well next thing you know, he’ll be telling you that your high heels are good for his posture!  Oh yeah, he looked like a real lumberjack in those pink laceys.  Hey! I am secure with my masculinity.  Y’know, I’m beginning to see what Jake was talking about.  The silk? Feels really good!  Yeah! And-and things aren’t as…smashed down as I thought they were gonna be.  Yeah! And you have so many more choices than you do with men’s underwear!  Bikini, French cut, thong! And-and the fabrics! You’ve got cotton, silk, lace! And y’know what I’ve always wondered about?  Yeah! Much! Listen uh, not that I’m y’know insecure about my manhood or anything y’know, but I think I need to hook up with a woman like right now.  Y’know, you look familiar. Do I know you from somewhere?  Oh! Maybe it’s because I’m on television. I’m an actor on Days of Our Lives.  Yeah.  Hm-mmm.  There’s this woman, that I like.  A lot.  Well, it’s complicated.  She’s with this other guy.  For a long time.  And I could never do that to the guy, y’know?  ’Ccause we’re really good friends.  Yeah, he’s the best.  Oh, I don’t know.  I do! So much! I can’t stop thinking about her! I can’t sleep, I—  It’s Rachel.  Yes.  Yes. I like Rachel.  Yeah, but it’s not a big deal.  I’m an actor, y’know? As-as a group, we tend to be over dramatic.  Look no, I-I know it’s bad, and I know it’s wrong. Okay? But-but it’s not like anything’s ever gonna happen. Y’know? These-these are just feelings, they’re gonna go away.  Oh come on Ross! Hey Ross-Ross don’t…  Hey.  Look, I understand if you came by to hit me, I deserve it.  Oh what then? Kick me?  Oh now—Hey Ross-Ross! Do you wanna-wanna come in for a beer or something?  Do uh, do you got any beer? All-all I got is this melon stuff that Rachel left. I don’t…  Anyway, it uh…look it’ll just…take me a while to get over her, that’s all. I’m not even sure how to do that, I mean I’ve never been in love before so…  Yeah, I thought you knew that.  Wow. Hey look, if it helps, I don’t want to feel this way. Honest. I just keep thinking, \"Ah, I’ll get over this.\" Y’know? I just—It just keeps gettin’ harder. I don’t, I don’t know what to do. Y’know? What do I do?  Okay that’s the green stuff talkin’.  But what if uh—and I’m not saying she will be—But…  Are you sure?  Hey thanks.  Oh my God I have to tell her! I haven’t even thought about what I will say. What should I say?  I uh, I just came by because I-I want to talk to you about something.  Here? In the hall? What are we animals?  Okay umm, I just came by to tell you that I…want to have dinner with you tonight. That’s all.  I would, but this is a nice place and my T-shirt has a picture of Calvin doing Hobbs.  Uh… How long have we known each other?  Uh-huh, long time.  But over the past few weeks…  Actually uh, could you give us a second?  I’m not quite sure.  Yeah, here we are. Uhh… I… I think I’m…falling in love with you.  I’m falling in love with you.  Does it really matter?  Sure!  Hey-hey-hey, hey! You can’t. Okay? Ever!  Hey.  I do. There’s uh, let’s see, Guy With a Mustache, Smokes-A-Lot Lady, Some Kids I’ve Seen, and A Red-haired Guy Who Does Not Like To Be Called Rusty.  Yeah?

Pitchin\\' in on the weekends, helping to plant the emus...  Real estate, huh? Hmmm...  Hi I\\'m Joey. This is Chandler.  Is there anything we should know about the apartment?  Well, you seem pretty insulted by that. What? I\\'m not good enough for you?  What?  Hey dude, what\\'s up?  Did you take that tape?  I don\\'t know. Who\\'m I\\'m married to?  She hot?  How did she get me to settle down?  Guess I don\\'t know. My experience: if a girl says yes to being taped... She doesn\\'t say no to much else, I tell ya...  Well it\\'s okay, its like... its just a football game.  Yeah, see... you were all worried for nothing.  I *love* my job.  Rach, these are for you.

Oh, but hey look, at least let us bring the wine.  See ya tomorrow!  What?  What-what’s wrong with Monica and Chandler?  Blah?!  Uh, they’re like my best friends. Are you saying we can’t hang out with them? ‘Cause that would kinda be a problem.  I guess.  If you want, I’ll sell my friends and use the money to buy you presents.  Hi!  Thanks.

Come on, please-please you guys, don’t-don’t be mad. I’m sure she just, she just said that stuff because she was nervous and you guys are like my best friends! Y’know? And it was our first date!

Didn’t everybody have a great time?  Oh well then, good night!  See? Eh, wasn’t that fun?  All right, uh, we’ve got a little bit of a problem here.

I can\\'t believe it, Ross. This sucks!  Isn\\'t there any way you can keep him?  How do you get a monkey into a zoo?  Did you call the cops?  Apparently he was this Russian dictator who slaughtered all these people. You\\'d think you would\\'ve known that!  Phoebe. Whaddyou think a good stage name for me would be?

And it\\'s engraved too, check it out.  Put it on.  You have any idea what this\\'ll do for your sex life?  If you hated the bracelet so much, Chandler, you should have just said so.  Well, what about the fact that you insulted the bracelet and you made fun of me?  Hey.  How come you have two?  Get out.  Wow, is this friendship? I think so. Check it out, we\\'re bracelet buddies.

Thanks for telling me!  Ohhhh, good one! And Yemen that actually sounds like a real country.  All right, come on look, Ross can take care of himself! It’s not like he’s…Chandler!  Well, maybe that’s because you’re closer to you. So you look bigger to you from where you are.  I totally don’t know what you’re talking about.  No.  Dude, if you go back out there, you’re gonna be Dead Ross!  The Red Ross! Okay.  Yeah, sure.  Uhh, look, your eye’s still popping out a little, I’m gonna go get some ice.  And I gotta go sell some Christmas trees.  What? Me having a job?  Well, I’m pretty tired from lugging the trees around all day. Hey, Phoebe listen, you got this all wrong. Those trees were born to be Christmas trees, their fulfilling their life purpose, by, by making people happy.  Hey. What, what are you doing here?  Look now, Phoebe remember, hey, their just fulfilling their Christmas....  Sure.  All right.  Oh, that’s, that’s ah, one of the old ones, he’s just taking it to the back.  Well we have to make room for the fresh ones.  Well, they go into the chipper.  All right, I’ll take a box of the cream filled Jesus’s.  Look Rach, wasn’t this supposed to a temporary thing? I thought you wanted to do fashion stuff?  If you ask me, as long as you got this job, you’ve got nothing pushing you to get another one. You need the fear.  What? Rachel, listen, have you ever heard of Fortunata Fashions?  Well my old man is doing a plumbing job down there and he heard they have an opening. So, you want me to see if I can get you an interview?  Not a problem.  And now for the great news.  Okay, and ah, this one here is a Douglas Fir, now it’s a little more money, but you get a nicer smell.  Yeah, the ah, trees that don’t fulfil their Christmas destiny are thrown in the chipper.  Pheebs, you gotta stop this, I working on commission here.  Ooh... I can\\'t believe I\\'m kissing you. I\\'m kissing Rachel!  Well, I only said that because of Ross, you know. Then I saw him kissing Charlie...  Oh my God, it\\'s Ross. What are we gonna do?  No idea what it means.  I don\\'t believe this... Have you guys been...  Is he gone?  Pssst...  Well, he\\'s with Charlie now.  Probably, yeah... I mean, maybe we should... hold off until we talk to Ross.  Yeah, I think that\\'d be best... So, so I\\'m gonna... I\\'m gonna take off...  Six years? Wow... It\\'s almost as long as highschool...  Absolutely! He\\'s not thinking about you.  I\\'m thinking about you...  Let\\'s forget about Ross...  What\\'s wrong?  Yeah... we really need to talk to Ross...  Whoo, whoo. Wow, it\\'s uhm... kinda weird that I\\'m sitting next to Charlie after we broke up.  Look, does someone mind switching to sit with Charlie?  I understand...  I guess so. I\\'m just... really nervous.  Ooh...  I\\'m gonna get the lasagna.  Hey!  Yeah?  You kissed.  I saw you.  Ross, Ross, Ross... It\\'s okay.  It\\'s okay. You know, I totally understand, alright? You guys, make way more sense than her and I ever did, you know. And... I want you to be happy.  Yeah... Now I have something...  Oh... uh... look... before you...  I am those things, yeah.  Dude!  I can\\'t think of anything.  Yeah.  I couldn\\'t. He was saying all these really nice things about me. I didn\\'t want him to get mad and take \\'em all back. I\\'m on a edge on Chandler.  Thank you. Yeah, I appreciate that.  Hey!  So, did you err... did you tell Ross?  Alright, alright, okay, uhm... How \\'bout this, how about this? Tomorrow... tomorrow we\\'ll both go and we\\'ll tell him together.  I know, I know..., but that\\'s okay. I mean, we can control ourselves, we\\'re not animals.

Yeah, there\\'s just one thing that might be kind\\'ve a problem. See, I, uh, had to kiss this guy.  No, as part of the audition. See, I\\'m up for this part of this guy, who the main guy kisses.  I did do it, I\\'m a professional.  See after the scene, Mr. Beatty comes up to me and says \\'good actor, bad kisser\\'. Can you believe that, me not a good kisser, that\\'s like, like Mother Theresa, not a good mother.  Yep, this kiss thing is defiantly a problem, Mr. Beatty wants to see it again on Monday. Man, I gotta figure out what I\\'m doing wrong. Oh, okay, one of you girls come over here and kiss me.  Come on, I need your help here.  You see this, this is a friend.  Then I don\\'t know what it is. What\\'s the problem?  Oh, well. Just ask her how long she\\'s gonna live. Women live longer than men.  Angela? Joey Tribiani. Listen, what are ya doing tonight.

All-all right, well make sure you tell him that Joey Tribbiani stopped by to drop off all of these clothes. Okay? I’m an actor; I’m kinda getting my picture up there on the wall.  I didn’t do that! Who would’ve done that?!  Yeah.  Hey Gunther.  Oh uh, well I just came in for a cup of coffee to go.  Oh hey Rach, listen—Hi!  Umm, can you do me a favor? I was talkin’ to my sister and she knows you work at Ralph Lauren…  No-no-no-no-no-no, not her, not her.

My agent would like to know why I didn\\'t show up at the audition I didn\\'t know I had today. The first good thing she gets me in weeks. How could you not give me the message?!  How is it you?  Yep, that\\'s my audition.  Well, Estelle tried, you know. The casting director told her that I missed my chance.  Pheebs, you can\\'t do that. The casting director doesn\\'t talk to friends, she only talks to agents.  What, what are you doing? What are you doing?  I\\'m sorry, it just felt nice.  Hey, I only got one good arm, you know. You should be doing stuff for me. Go get me a sweater.  Hey, you know about that?!  Well, I\\'ve never been through the tunnel myself, \\'cause as I understand it, you\\'re not allowed to go through with more than one girl in the car, right. But, it seems to me it\\'s pretty much like anything else, you know, face your fear. It have a fear of heights, you go to the top of the building! If you\\'re afraid of bugs.....get a bug. Right. In this case, you have a fear of commitment, so I say you go in there and be the most committed guy there ever was.  Oh, yeah. Go for it man, jump off the high dive, stare down the barrel of the gun, pee into the wind!  Come on baby, come on!  Thank you so much.

Look listen, that TV movie I went in for? Did you hear anything? I think I got a shot at it.  It\\'s okay, these things happen.  No! No, no you can\\'t quit! You\\'re the best agent I ever had! Look Pheebs, rejection is part being an actor, you can\\'t take it personally.  They actually said that?  Okay, shoot.  I didn\\'t get it?  Okay, what else?  Oh.  Look, it\\'s okay, no, no, no, really, look um, I really appreciate this Pheebs, but I think I\\'m gonna have to go back to Estelle.  Yeah, well don\\'t get me wrong, you\\'re a better agent than she is, but at least with her I don\\'t want to blow my pretty dumb brains out.  You do, thanks.  Wait a minute.  Wait a minute, did you just make up all that stuff just to get out of being my agent.  Oh hey, do you still have their final exams?  Oh, well think of it like this, when you’re 90…  No that’s not what I was going to say at all. No, what I was going to say is when you’re 90 you’ll still have the memory of what it was like to be with a 20-year-old.  Hey Chandler! Y’know that girl you went to college with who-who became a movie director?  Oh well listen, anyway she’s directing the new Al Pacino movie. You gotta get me an audition!

I mean I know it’s Thursday, but what time?  Ah-ha!  Well Ross, it seems pretty clear. I mean what’s more important? What people think or how you feel, huh? Ross, you gotta follow your heart.  Hey-hey-hey! So, how did it go with Dana? Any reason I should leave a block of time open say Thursday?  You couldn’t do it?!  Ah whatever!  No that’s all right. Don’t worry about it.  Rach! Hey!

Hey babies! Oh, I’m having the best morning. That uh, that Porsche I’ve got the keys too, still there!  You should see the treatment I get when I’m with that car! People are friendly; they-they wanna talk, and not just about the car! One guy gave me advice about my equity investments.  Yeah, she tops out at 130.  And that’s just in the city. I get her up to 160 when I take her upstate.  Sure!  Okay, take it easy.  Really? Oh uh, oh just give me five more minutes with it.  Oh I-I uh, found the keys and now I’m just polishing her up.  Yeah, but it’s my wax.  Why not?  Yeah, so did I.  No. No, I just uh, I just loved the way it feels when everybody thinks I own a Porsche.  Of course! Only an idiot would wear this stuff if you didn’t have the car! Right?  Why isn’t that valet back with my Porsche?  Hi! How are the Gellers?  Hey! Hey! Be careful around my Porsche!  Hey! How you doin’?  All right, I should get going, big day a work. Y’know I’m in a coma? Today, they do this test on me and it turns out I’m not brain dead.

I left you a note!  Hey, you can cancel plans with friends if there is the possibility for sex!  Wow! I’m so sorry; I had no idea it would bother you this much.  Awww! Mel Torme died.  Aw! Does that mean the Sam Goody’s sale is over?!  Hey.  Uh-uh, excuse me, I do have to interrupt on Ross’s behalf. I-I think the rule applies here y’know, since she has a chance to get on broad back…  Aww that’s nice. Family should be there, huh? This is her wedding, happiest day of her life.  What?! Tonight?!  After she gave me that big speech?! She goes and makes a date with a guy on the same night she has plans with me? I think she’s trying to pull a fast one on Big Daddy!  Yeah, this slow roasted salmon, just how slow are we talkin’ here?  Ohh, then no. Maybe I should hear those specials again.  You were right before. I mean, friends are so important.  Y’know-y’know what I really want?  Is to have a long, long talk. Y’know? Get Joey out on the open road and really open him up.  Yes! I will have the lobster ravioli.  What’s the rush? What?  Whoa-whoa, what is it?  A date?! No, no Pheebs you-you must be mistaken, because I know you wouldn’t schedule a date on the same night you have plans with a friend!  No, I’m gonna!! That’s right! Yeah, you made me feel really guilty about goin’ out with that girl! Like-like-like I did something terrible to you! And now Pheebs, you’re doing the same thing!  Okay, well my girl from the other night was special. She was a scientist too!  Well, she graduated from high school!  Fine!  Fine!  Hey, y’know you could always visit him.  Anything I can do? Whatever you need.  I can give it a shot.  Tampa Bay\\'s got a terrible team.  He should take the sack?  Yeah, Ross. You and the baby just need better blocking.  Oh, have either one of you guys ever been to the Rainbow Room? Is it real expensive?  I\\'m takin\\' Ursula tonight. It\\'s her birthday.  When\\'s that?  Oh, man. What\\'re the odds of that happening?  What can I do? Look, I don\\'t want to do anything to screw it up with Ursula.  Well, if she\\'s my friend, hopefully she\\'ll understand. I mean, wouldn\\'t you guys?  Your sister stood me up the other night.  I\\'ve been trying for two days. When I called the restaurant, they said she was too busy to talk. I can\\'t believe she\\'s blowin\\' me off.  Urse...  ..ah, what\\'re you doing here? I\\'ve been trying to call you.  No, no, no, don\\'t say \"listen.\" I know that \"listen.\" I\\'ve said that \"listen.\"  I don\\'t get it. What happened? What about everything you said under the bridge?  You don\\'t drink.  Why? Is it because I\\'m friends with Phoebe?  Then, uh, then I\\'m sorry.  I know...  I don\\'t know whether it\\'s just \\'cause we\\'re breakin\\' up or... what, but you have never looked so beautiful.  Pheebs?  We just got the message.  Great! Roomie!  Yeah! Well, now that you brought it up, our fridge is broken. We have to get a new one. Now, I checked around and your half is $400. Thanks a lot.  Look Rach, my parents bought this fridge just after I was born, okay? Now, I have never had a problem with it. Then you show up and it breaks! What does that tell ya’?  All right, now you know that the ATM will only lets you take out 300 at a time, I’ll take a check for the other hundred.  Of course I’m jokin’! I don’t take checks.  Oh, I’m sorry. Thank you Chandler.  Ooh! So close.  Hey-hey come on you guys, give him a break. Ross, seriously, how’s it going with her?  Huh.  The fridge broke. I have to eat everything. Cold cuts, ice cream, limes—Hey, what was in that brown jar?  Not anymore. So anyway, how do you want to pay me?  No! No! No! For my new fridge—our new fridge!  So what? Look, suppose we were a divorced couple.  And I got custody of the kid, right? Now suppose the kid dies and-and I gotta buy a new kid.  What? What the hell am I doing? You just broke my fridge!  All right. Chandler, do you remember how I told you about our fridge?  I still haven’t gotten a check for your half yet.  I’m not talking to you! You broke my fridge!  Really?!  Call it even?  Man, she is going to have a great time! Is she staying at the Hotel Corona?  Sure! I was there! Spring Break ’81! Woo-hoo!  So what? I drove down, sold T-shirts, had a blast. And y’know who knows how to party? Drunk college chicks.  I just got this really weird message from Ross. He said turn on MTV.  Ahh, to be 13 again.  C\\'mon, you\\'re going out with the guy! There\\'s gotta be something wrong with him!  Instead of...?  Never had that dream.  This guy says hello, I wanna kill myself.  Ohh.  And you never knew she was a lesbian...  Alright Ross, look. You\\'re feeling a lot of pain right now. You\\'re angry. You\\'re hurting. Can I tell you what the answer is?  Strip joint! C\\'mon, you\\'re single! Have some hormones!  I say push her down the stairs.  What, like there\\'s a rule or something?  Who\\'s Paul?   Hey, Paul!  Here\\'s a little tip, she really likes it when you rub her neck in the same spot over and over and over again until it starts to get a little red.  Hey Pheebs, you wanna help?  I\\'m thinking we\\'ve got a bookcase here.  Which goes where?  Done with the bookcase!  Hey-hey-hey-hey, if you\\'re gonna start with that stuff we\\'re outta here.  Ross, let me ask you a question. She got the furniture, the stereo, the good TV- what did you get?  You got screwed.  Shut up!  What are you talking about? \\'One woman\\'? That\\'s like saying there\\'s only one flavor of ice cream for you. Lemme tell you something, Ross. There\\'s lots of flavors out there. There\\'s Rocky Road, and Cookie Dough, and Bing! Cherry Vanilla. You could get \\'em with Jimmies, or nuts, or whipped cream! This is the best thing that ever happened to you! You got married, you were, like, what, eight? Welcome back to the world! Grab a spoon!  Congratulations.  Morning, Paul.  That wasn\\'t a real date?! What the hell do you do on a real date?  Yeah, I\\'m an actor.  I doubt it. Mostly regional work.  Look, it was a job all right?  I can\\'t believe what I\\'m hearing here.  Oh, you wouldn\\'t know a great butt if it came up and bit ya.  Really. Why can\\'t we just get some pizzas and get some beers and have fun?  Woah, woah, woah, uh, no Shannon Cooper.  Cause she uh, she steals stuff.  Hey I liked her, alright. Maybe, maybe too much. I don\\'t know I guess I just got scared.  I didn\\'t think anyone\\'d buy that, ok.  Oh no, can\\'t invite her. She also steals.  Oh that\\'s nice. Happy birthday Rachel, here\\'s some goo.  Uh, hey, Dr. Greene, why don\\'t you come with me, we\\'ll put your jacket on Rachel\\'s bed.  Right this is staging.  Quick volleyball question.  Yeah, we set up a court in your room. Uh, you didn\\'t really like that grey lamp, did you?  Ahh, you drive safe.  Kinda looks like that stuff you get when you get a bad infection.  Hey Pheebs! Listen, uh can you do me a favor? I forgot the pin number to my ATM card can, can you get it for me?  Uh, I scratched it on the ATM machine down on the corner.  That\\'s it! Thanks Pheebs!  Uhh, my stunt double. Yeah, and y\\'know, he\\'s getting a little too familiar for my tastes.  Uhh Pheebs, I heard that. Can you put him on?  Don\\'t come out here!  I got that! I forgive ya! Don\\'t come out here!  Well, I\\'m totally over it Chandler. Friends forever! Don\\'t come out here!  Hi!  What-what are you guys doing here? I thought I told you not to come.  Well, the movie got shutdown because they ran out of money, so I\\'m working here \\'til it starts up again, if it ever does.  Yeah, what-what\\'s going on?  Dawson?!  Aww, there we go.  Ooh, so close.  Whoa! Whoa! Guys! Please! Come on! Come on! This is obviously just a big misunderstanding.  Hey, y\\'know in Roman times this was more than just a hat.  Yeah, sure! Sure! They would uh, they would scrub the floors with it! They would use it to get the mud off their shoe. And sometimes underneath the horse would get dirty so they would stick it right…  All right well, I\\'ll take you someplace nice then. Look! A guy tipped me a hundred bucks today.  Yeah-yeah, he was playing blackjack for like an hour and he won $5,000. Can you believe that? $5,000!  Wait a minute! Why don\\'t I do what that guy did? I\\'ll take this $100 and turn it into $5,000! And then I\\'ll turn that into enough money to get my movie going again!  Chandler! I don\\'t need luck. I have thought this through!  Chandler! You are not gonna believe this! I have found my identical hand twin!  My identical hand twin!  What\\'s it sound like? It\\'s a guy with my identical hands! It was incredible! Chandler, the dealer\\'s hands were exactly like me! It-it was like looking at my hands in a mirror!  Don’t you see what this means?! I can forget about that stupid movie. I\\'m gonna be a millionaire!  Look, I don\\'t have it all worked out yet, but it\\'s gotta mean big money! Come on! Identical hands!  Hey, are you unsupporting me again?  Pheebs!!  I found my identical hand twin!  All right! Hey-hey!  No, don\\'t be sorry. I don\\'t need it anymore. I found my identical hand twin!  My identical hand twin! The person whose hands are exactly like mine! This thing is a gold mine!  Okay. Well, if that\\'s how you feel about it, fine! None of you get to live with me in my great big hand-shaped mansion! Except uh, you Pheebs. You can live in the thumb.  It\\'s me, Joey!  Okay, so what are we going to do about this hand twin thing?!  Look, you and I have been given a gift. Okay? We have to do something with it. Like-like, hand modeling! Huh? Or-or magic! And you know NASA\\'s gonna wanna talk to us!  Hey!  Hi!  Look-look-look you guys, I need some help! Okay? Someone is going to have to convince my hand twin to cooperate!  Uhh, Ms. Phalange, may I ask you a question as an impartial person at-at this table?  Wouldn\\'t you pay good money to see these identical hands showcased in some type of a uh, entertainment venue?  This is unbelievable Phoebs, how can you be married?  I can\\'t believe you. You told me it was a nubbin.  I don\\'t know, you see somethin\\', you hear a word, I thought that\\'s what it was. Let me see it again.  Ahh, alright, alright, alright, I was young and I just wanted a job, OK. But at the last minute I couldn\\'t go through with it so they let me be the guy who comes in to fix the copier but can\\'t \\'cause there\\'s people havin\\' sex on it.  What happens if you flick it?  Foxy lady.  The Ice Capades?  Thank you. Wait wait wait wait, you see me again. Hang on, the guy\\'s butt\\'s blockin\\' me. There I am, there I am, there I am, there I am, there I am. . .  Me too, we should get goin\\'.  I got time.  Boy that Julie\\'s a talker, huh?  Oh yeah, I added three.  Oh uh, can I give you a hand?  Boyfriend?  Okay. Yeah. Listen would you uh, would you like to have dinner with me tonight?  Oh.  Listen, sorry I didn’t stop by last night but I had a date.  Well check it out, I was with this really hot girl who just moved in right across the street!  Yeah!  Two days ago.  Oh yeah?  Well, I sorta am. I mean yeah, I’m dating this girl who’s also seeing another guy. But, I don’t know, I’m not to worried about it.  Obviously! So, how do we decide?  Yeah-yeah I like that but just to go in another direction…  Yeah well we should order some food then.  Ah yeah—wait a second now! Look we’re gonna have to set a spending limit on the date. I don’t have the money to take her to a fancy place like that.  All right, well I guess I’ll just have to do what I do on dates.  Okay. Can I borrow 94 dollars?  I just wanted to come by and y’know, wish you good luck on your date.  Yeah. What time are you meeting her?  Wow, that’s in like 20 minutes. You’d better get dressed.  You spent a hundred dollars. That’s the limit. You’re screwed!  Oh-oh! So that’s the way it’s gonna be huh? Yeah I can break the rules too y’know!  I don’t know.  Y’know what Ross? I’m not gonna let you get away with this!  Well we’ll see!  Hi!  Oh I like this place. And technically, technically I’m not breaking any rules so I…  Hi!  A woman in a man’s body.  So y’know Ross it’s funny ‘cause, you look familiar to me too. Have you ever been married?  So you’ve just married the one time then?  No. It just seems like Ross is the kind of a guy that would marry a woman on the verge of being a lesbian and then push her over the edge.  Have you ever slept in the same bed as a monkey?!  Fine! Have you ever got stuck in a pair of your own leather pants?!  Monkey lover!  When do you think we lost her?  Uhm... oh... I don\\'t know, it\\'s too hard.  Oh... food. No, sex. Food! Sex! Food! Se-I don\\'t know! Good God, I don\\'t know, I want girls on bread!  Chandler? Forty-five minutes? Well, something is not right. I just can’t believe he would do this to Monica!  Hey, is uhm... is Chandler here?  I knew he couldn\\'t be with a woman for 45 minutes!!  Shouldn\\'t we all vote on stuff like this?!  What the hell are you doin\\'?  I put it on to scare Chandler!  It smells really bad in here.  It\\'s Joey.  Oooooh!  Big fat goalie.  Weekend at Bernie’s.  Everyday use.  Guest.  Uhh, 11!  Hey, don’t get mad at us! No one forced you to raise the stakes!  Rachel\\'s right. This is where you guys belong.  I\\'m really sorry you guys.  You know, I\\'m really sorry I wasn\\'t more supportive before.  And about this Nancy thing... If you\\'re not sleeping with her, should I?  Monica, hey, can I borrow the Porsche?  Alright!  Oh well, the powerball lottery is upto 300 million and they don\\'t sell tickets here in New York, so...  Uh!  Seriously, Ross, you don\\'t want in on this?  I like those odds!  I did?  Oh yeah! The casserole lady.  Ooh! Tough odds!  I\\'ll do it!! It\\'ll get the casserole stink off of mine.  I can\\'t tell you what I\\'m wishing for! Else...you know...won\\'t come true!  Can\\'t really say!  I won, hey!  Seriously, that\\'s your fantasy? To invest it?  Ooh, ooh, I know! We should pool all own money and buy the Knicks!  Oh, you will when I pick you as starting forward.  You\\'re not gonna let me buy the Knicks?? I can\\'t believe you\\'re taking this away from me!  Dude, I\\'m sorry. But hey, there\\'s one spot left, right?  I was with you the whole time we were in Connecticut, when did you even get those?  And what did she say?  And I like to think I had a little something to do with it.  Well, before, with the wishbone... I didn\\'t wish we would win the lottery, I wished you\\'d get the job.  Oh yeah.  Me too.  Tell us!  And it’s not fake, it’s totally brutal.  What? My hands are totally clean, I just gave the duck a bath.  Yeah. What are we getting?  No-o-o!!  Hi!  Oh that’s on the house courtesy of Joey Tribbiani.  It will be when you look like that in a tight skirt! This is great! I’m getting more dates than ever!  How about a scone on the house baby?  What?!  Well if it’s free food, how come you’re charging me for it?  Well, what if they came in third in a modeling contest?  That’ll be $3.85.  Yeah, not it here it isn’t.  What? No-no it’s her birthday!  But it really…  Ya know, one of these times you\\'re gonna really be naked and we\\'re not gonna come over.  Oh, hey, Monica, we\\'ve got a question.  No, not that one. We\\'re trying to figure out who to bring to the Knicks game tonight, we have an extra ticket.  Ok, uh, hey Richard, if you had an extra ticket to the Knicks game and you had to choose between a friend who smells and one who bruises you who would you pick?  I don\\'t know.  How do we say yes now and make it seem like we\\'re not doin\\' it just to ride in the cool car?  Hey.  Yeah right after we stole his lunch money and gave him a wedgie. What\\'s the matter with you, he\\'s parking the car.  No problem. Hey Chandler  Ok.  Ok. He kept my dollar.  How come Richard looks so much cooler with one of these than me?  Not like him, per-se, just not un-like him.  Oh we flipped for it. I got the cigar, he got the moustache. Figured if we both grew it, we\\'d look like dorks.  Yeah, we\\'re goin\\' to a Ranger game.  We\\'re the guys.  Man you are incredible.  Yeah, he\\'s just really great to hang around with.  Oh yeah.  Nooooo.  Not a dad.  Yeah, she’s been out there for twenty minutes, I’m surprised you didn’t hear her on the way over.  You guys don’t think I look 19?  I was afraid of that.  ‘Sup? ‘Sup dude?  So you’re playing a little Playstation, huh? That’s whack! Playstation is whack! ‘Sup with the whack Playstation, ‘sup?! Huh? Come on, am I 19 or what?!  Come on man, really how old?!  Yeah!  When? Today? Some, not a lot.  Don’t worry about that man, that happens.  Yeah! Once.  I did it anyway.  Oh my God! I cannot believe you guys are talking about this! The problems in the bedroom are between the man and the woman!!! All right?!! Now Chandler is doing the best he can!!  What?  You guys kissed! Oh my—this is huge!  Monica-Monica-Monica-Monica, listen-listen, listen, listen, would-would it make you feel better if we all stop talking about Ross and Rachel.  You got it. Okay. Now, I can pass for 19 right?!  Really?  Seriously?  Psss, that is whack!  Yeah! Well, I think we’ll see if they actually let you play. Huh? I mean they tell you anything you want to hear like-like, \"You look 19,\" and then they just take it away like-like, \"No you don’t.\"  Wouldn’t she?  They break your heart, don’t they?  Yeah! If you wanna sing at their wedding, well you sing at their wedding!  What?! What’s wrong with my eyes.  And that’ll get rid of my wisdom?  Well, that went well. Yeah.  Well, I figured we’re in another country, so it doesn’t count.  Emily is kinda taking a long time, huh?  Hey, dude, let me in. I got a girl out here!  No you don’t, I just saw you go in there with Monica!  Look, which one of us is gonna be having sex in there, me or you?  My Giant? I love that movie!  Can I ask you something?  Felicity and I, we’re watching My Giant, and I was thinking, \"I’m never gonna be as good an actor as that giant.\" Do you think I’m just wasting my life with this acting thing?  I mean, the giant is like five years younger than me, y’know, you think I’ll ever get there?  Thanks man.  But what about how much taller he is than me?  I mean, there’s no way I can make myself taller now, y’know? And who knows what science will come up with in the future, but Chandler, what if I die an unsuccessful, regular sized man?  Hey, Monica, wow you’ve been in the bathroom for like a half-hour.  Had the beef-tips, huh?  Hi!  All right, I’m gonna go say hi the chick and the duck.  Why would you need to say hi to them, you’ve been feeding them for four days?  Hey! Let me ask you guys something. I have a new headshot taken tomorrow right and the photographer said she thinks I  On...?  Ok! Stop it you guys! Stop staring! You\\'re freaking me out!  Oh man! I have to get those done too?!  Hey hey! You dye your hair!  Arghhh! Double standards!  Hey. I\\'m here for my eyebrow appointment.  Chandler Bing.  OK Thanks.  Thanks. Do you get a lot of guys in here?  Oh good...

Listen that�s a pretty girly hour we just spent, we should add some manly make up for it.  Comb my eyelashes.  Hey!  Ha, oh, of course.  Your eyebrows look weird.  I know. Ross is getting married.  Everybody’s doing stuff!  No-no-no-no-no, I saw an ad for this video, people climb that thing everyday! We could totally do that!  Yeah!  Hey!  We’re gonna climb Mt. Everest!  We could get that Everest video though.  Yeah. Yeah.  Yeah we are!  It\\'s never gonna happen.  Don’t answer that.  Awful! Horrible!  She was nothing compared to you.  Ewwwww!  Hey!  Don’t worry man, I get to bring a guest. We’ll show him.  He broke up with Julie. Well, go hug her, for god\\'s sakes.  Lookin\\' good Mr. Cotter.  It’s better! You can’t go to a museum in your underwear!  I bet we could get videos of all the sites, get a VCR in our hotel room... we\\'d never even have to go outside!  Oh-ho! I bet the British version is gooooood!  Chandler, if it really hurts that bad you should just tell her.  Oh! Yeah, look there\\'s this play all right? And I\\'m up for the part of this real cool like suave international guy. A real clothes horse. So I figure that everyone at the audition is gonna be wearing this kinda y\\'know, ultra-hip, high fashion stuff.  Yeah, like you could find something as sophisticated as this.  Great! Thanks, Rach!  All right.  Are you all right?  Pheebs! Sorry!  Pheebs, I\\'m so sorry.  All right, then you\\'d better show me some of that too then.  Really? A purse?  It looks like a women\\'s purse.  Maybe you need sex. I had sex a couple days ago.  Well, I ain\\'t gonna say no to that.  Hey!  What? Are you referring to my man\\'s bag? At first, I thought it just looked good, but it\\'s practical too. Check it out! It\\'s got compartments for all your stuff! Your wallet! Your keys! Your address book!  Why would I return it? I love this bag!  All right relax, look I\\'ll pay you with the money from the acting job I am definitely gonna get thanks to you.  Hey Pheebs, I\\'m so sorry.  What did you say to him?  Well, first it\\'s not a purse.  I mean if-if you\\'re thinking it\\'s a woman\\'s bag, it\\'s not. It\\'s a man\\'s bag!  Noooo. No-no-no, these babies sell themselves.  Yeah but I didn’t read anything.  Yeah, I thought so too but, she said the casting people had some problems with me.  Y\\'know what? It was a stupid play anyway!  I can\\'t believe I\\'m hearing this!  Done.  So Pheebs what’s this guy like?  Yeah, are you just going down there to gawk at that hot girl with the belly button ring again?  Yeah!  Uh, y\\'know what, we’re having second thoughts about our copying needs. And we’ll need a little more time to think about it.  We’ll be there.  Uh, 10:30.  4:30.  Yeah. Hey, remember when she brought up that thing about the three of us?  She was kidding about that right?  God, that would be weird it that situation presented itself tonight, huh?  Dude, I don’t know.  Yeah.  Yeah, for sure. Okay. Probably want the first thing to be, never open your eyes. Y\\'know, because you don’t want to be doing something and then look up and see something you don’t want to be seeing.  Yeah, I guess, but what’s like heads and what’s tails?  So what are you gonna do?  Yeah, tell that to my Uncle Lenny.  Nothing, he’s just really believes in that.  Thursday? But that�s Halloween.  I know, u-uch.  What about me, he? Only had one lunch today.  No, they�re comin�, we�re waitin� right here.  Maybe we should just eat now.  Wha-a how about this: Another table leaves, right? But there�s still some food left on their place, okay, what�s the restaurant�s policy about people eatin� that?  Oh, uh, again. Can I make a special request: Can you bring everything as soon as it�s ready? Appetizers, entrees, we don�t care.  That�s a great story�can I eat it?  Ross bruises like a peach. He bruises like a peach.  And remember whatever comes up first. Okay? And hurry, because �  Son of a bitch!  Chandler, control your woman!  So? Did have sex, right?  See ya. Well, this is just us.  Do, do you gonna do it now?  Excellent. The shrew in particular was exclusive.  Joey! Joey.  That�s the best birthday ever.  Hey!  Hey, I see you guys already met, huh?  Didn\\'t I tell ya? Always showin\\' off.  Oh, Kath, we should get going. We\\'re going to by hamsters.  Hey.  Yeah-yeah, I told her about the time you got drunk and fell asleep with your head in the toilet.  It\\'s 4:30.  Okay, I see what\\'s going on here.  Yeah! You don\\'t like Kathy.  Yeah, you\\'ve been avoiding her ever since we started going out. Look, I made an effort to like Janice, now I think it\\'s your turn to make an effort to like Kathy by going out to dinner with us. Right?  Is she great or what?  Kathy was being really nice and you just walked away. I thought we had a deal.  I want you to like her! But if that\\'s too damned difficult for you, then the least you can do is pretend.  Well then, do it better!  Well, that\\'s pretty good. But you might wanna tone it down a little.  I\\'m tellin\\' ya that girl totally winked at me.  Morning, hey, you made pancakes?  B-bye Janice. So when ya\\' dumpin\\' her.  Come on, quite yankin\\' me.  This is Janice.  Okay. All right. You look me in the eye and tell me, without blinking, that you\\'re not breaking up with her. No blinking.  Cute! This is Janice! You remember Janice?  There you go! That\\'s the spirit I\\'m looking for! What can we do? Huh? All right who\\'s first? Huh? Ross?  Yeah, we\\'ll call that Plan B. All right?  Wheel!  I say, \\'I am there!\\' Cool! Aw, is Ross going to?  Jan-ice. \\'Cause I, just, I feel bad for Ross, you know, we-we always go together, we\\'re like the three hocke-teers.  Look, I don\\'t hate Janice, she\\'s-she\\'s just a lot to take, you know.  Oh, hey. Come on man, don\\'t look at me like that, she used to drive you nuts before too, remember?  Look, what do you want me to say?  I, ah, I never said hate, I was very careful about that.  And you got a \\'hate\\' from that?! Your taking a big leap there...  But what does that gonna do...  Okay. I\\'m in.  Does it have to be a whole day?  Yeah, I know, I sleep in the next room.  Hey!  Yeah, yeah. We went to a Mets game, we got Chinese food, and you know, I love this woman. You have got competition buddy.  I\\'m sorry man, I tired, I really did.  But, hey, look, you know the good thing is, is that we spent the whole day together and I survived, and what\\'s even more amazing, so did she. It was bat day at Shea Stadium.  No man, that\\'s huge! Now, I know I can stand to be around her, which means I get to hang out with you, which is kinda the whole point, anyway.  Oh, hey, Chandler, we, ah, we stopped by the coffee shop and ran into Ross.  Hey, if it makes you feel any better, I do it too.  Oh yeah, I always picture your Mom when I\\'m having sex.  Hey, this girl won\\'t turn around and I can\\'t tell whether she\\'s hot or not, what do you think?  Alright thanks, Oh hey have you talked to Chandler?  how come?  oh why don\\'t you fly out there and surprise him.  didn\\'t till just now.

I have to go to the bathroom too, but I don’t want him complimenting my thing.  I know  Yeah uh, Phoebe! Look umm, I want to apologize about before, okay? We were being jerks. Parker’s a nice guy and I’d like to get to know him.  Why?  What-what?  I know I’m having the worst time. There was a 15-minute line for the buffet, and when I finally got up to the plates, I slipped on a giant booger!  I guess it could’ve been, I didn’t really look at it. Y’know, I just wiped it on Chandler’s coat and got the hell out of there.  Oh hey, you should be excited about him. There’s nothing wrong with him he’s a good guy.  Yeah. Ya know what I think; I think we were all just being too negative.  Actually, you have a little bit of an edge.  Nothing…  Monica? What time is it?  But it\\'s dark out.  Hey!  Doesn’t seem like it\\'s going to work, I mean…  Hi!  So I\\'m thinking, basically we pick it up and then we flip it.  You don\\'t know how long we\\'re gonna be in here! We may have to repopulate the Earth.  Hey, you\\'re back!  How was your conference?  Oh, so your weekend was a total bust?  Hey, you\\'re back too!  Hey, how was your chef thing?  Nooooo!!! Y\\'know what? Now that I think about it, I constantly find myself without twenties and you always have lots!  You want my advice?  You\\'re not gonna like it.  You got married to fast.  I told ya.  Man, if anyone asked me to give up any of you, I couldn\\'t do it.  Hi, Rach.  Hey, you\\'re not Kip!  Oh, that poor bastard.  Hey, Mr. Bing. That uh, hotel you stayed at called. Said someone left an eyelash curler in your room.  \\'Cause I figured you\\'d hooked up with some girl and she\\'d left it there.  Oohh!! Ohh! Oh-oh-oh! Oh-oh!!  Ohhhhhhhhhhh!!!!!!!  How?! When?!  IN LONDON!!!  But it is a big deal!! I have to tell someone!  All right! Man, this is unbelievable! I mean, it\\'s great, but…  Aww, I don\\'t want to see that!  I guess I\\'m done.  I think I\\'m gonna take-off.  It’s the chick! She’s…going through some changes.  She’s mad because I know today’s her laundry day and that means she’s wearing her old lady underpants.  Yeah, what’s that about?  Oh yeah? Ross, how many items left in that bag?  Six.  All right, we’ll start with…apples.  Okay. Uhh, tortilla chips, yogurt.  Okay, the last thing…  No-no, not for like another two weeks.  Serious?  No! All right, who-who makes up the questions?  Huh.  I know.  Animals dressed as humans.  It’s All Relative.  I took a shot.  Hey, no way, that rooster’s family!  What do you have against the duck?! He doesn’t make any noise!  Look, we are not gonna…  Oooooh!  Okay.  Big fat goalie.  Weekend at Bernie’s.  Everyday use.  Guest.  Uhh, 11!  I call Monica’s room!  Sure I can, standard shotgun rules, I’m sight of the room and I called it.  What?  Hey—ooh Pheebs, are they in there?  Oh wow! You can tell this soon.  What?!  You can’t just ignore the bet! It’s a bet! You bet and you bet and if you lose, you lose the bet!  Hey, don’t get mad at us! No one forced you to raise the stakes!  But it is our apartment!  Did you see the size of the closets?!  Hey.  Sure, neighbor come on in.  Uh, no, she’s at dance class.  No.  No.  I’m a man.  Hey. Uh, can I talk to you for a second? This, uh, kid in this picture. Do you, uh, know this kid? Is that like a relative or something?  Yeah, that’s what I was afraid of.. Okay, uhh…Look Janine I really want you to feel at home here, but some of this new stuff. It’s…too girly.  Look I don’t know this baby. I don’t know if she’s a famous artist or not. You know, and I don’t want to be a jerk but you’re changing too much around here.  Yeah but it’s too much stuff. You know like, you got the candles and the foofy schmoofer thing here and over here you got a picture of a watering can.  I’m sure it’s a famous watering can, okay. But, come on…and what is with the really hot stick in the bathroom?  Ohh, well, that’s ok then. But, okay my towels for instance. I come in to the bathroom here and my towel is not on the floor where keep it. It’s up here on some hook..and…smells different.  Yeah, well, it feels different.  Alright, I can make my peace with the clean dry towels…Also what is with these chips you bought?  Hey Chandler. Come on in. We’re knitting pot holders.  So what’s really neat. If you sear the stems of the flowers first in a frying pan, your arrangement will look fresh much longer.  What?  Hey. Hey look I am still Joey, okay. Flowers they’re just, you know, they’re nice to look at. And that happens to be a picture by a famous artist. Of a famous baby.  No I’m not. Why would you say that? That’s just mean.  It’s not what you said. It’s the way you said it….Oh My God, I’m a women!!!  Hey, uhh, I need to talk to you.  I’m sorry but we’ve got to get rid of all this girlie stuff in here. I, uh, I got to be a man! Okay. The living room has to remain a guy place, okay? That’s just the way it has to be.  And, uhh, maybe the watering can there.  And a couple of these little tiny boxes.  Y’know what’s more generous than that?! Fifty percent! Y’know what’s even more generous than that?!!  Oh, ha-ha-ha! Ooh! Wait a minute, I used to get medical experiments down on me all the time!  Yeah?  Uhh do it?  Ohh, hey! Why don’t you book a date for both of you at one of those romantic spas?  And of course, crotchless panties.  You can’t make crotchless panties? You take, you take a pair of scissors and you just cut…  But it’s $2,000.  Well how about this one? Testing the effects of Joey Tribbiani on attractive nurse receptionists.  Look, I got to apologize on the behalf of Carl.  Oh, did I not mention? Carl is a guy I hired to be my identical twin for a medical research project.  Yeah, he’s the reason I didn’t get that big Minute Maid commercial a couple of years ago remember? We were supposed to be brothers, but he messed it up.  All right Carl, we’re next. Now remember, what is not gonna be?  That’s right! And what are you not gonna do?  That’s us.  That’s right, $2,000.  Damnit Carl!  Do we need a cake?  All right.  Well I guess I gotta start savin\\' up for Ross\\'s birthday, so I guess I\\'ll just stay home and eat dust bunnies.  Yes! Yeah, it\\'s like they\\'re always saying \"let\\'s go here, let\\'s go there\". Like we can afford to go here and there.  For Ross.  Hi.  If it\\'s not you, this is a horrible story.  Cool.  Sorry, sorry.  What are these, like famous chickens?  Yeah, I\\'ll have the Thai chicken pizza. But, hey, look, if I get it without the nuts and leeks and stuff, is it cheaper?  Thank you.  Yeah.  Ok, um, uh, we three feel like, that uh, sometimes you guys don\\'t get that uh, we don\\'t have as much money as you.  \\'Cause it\\'s always somethin\\', you know, like Monica\\'s new job, or the whole Ross\\'s birthday hoopla.  Yeah.  Thanks.  Look, it\\'s a nice gesture, it is. But it just feels like--  Charity.  Oh, now you\\'re tellin\\' us how you feel.  Me too.  Fine.  Come on you guys, one more time.  Nooo.  Yeah, look, we were just saying, this whole thing is really stupid.  You partied with Hootie and the Blowfish?  And we don\\'t work hard?  And you feel like we hold you back.  So you need someone who knows fashion, to tell you what looks good.  Oh hey Rach!  Maybe you could take Charlie shopping.  Are you kidding? Rachel loves to shop! And she has great taste! Yeah, she\\'s the one who taught me, you don\\'t wear white after labour day and that you always, always, always have to put on underwear when you\\'re trying on clothes.  What\\'s the matter, Pheebs?  Oh, ain\\'t that nice? The three of you trying on slutty lingerie together.  Why would you ruin it, who was that hurtin\\'?  Just... seeing what it\\'d be like to be a paleontologist... it\\'s fun, yeah!  Bye.  All right, so. How did it go at the fertility clinic?  So you\\'re ruling out surrogacy?  So, I don\\'t have to learn what that means?  Enough said, I\\'m there for you man. Where is she, upstairs?  Come on Ross, be a good guy. Step up and do it!  Hello?  No. no... eh... she went shopping with Rachel. Why? What\\'s up?  Oh! How\\'s it going?  What!? But I already bought my ticket to Bermuda!  Fine, I\\'ll rent a car and drive...! Ross, you have to get that job!  Well, just wake him up!  Then don\\'t go!  Alright, then you go to that party and you pretend to be over Mike. And afterward you come to my place and I\\'ll get you good and drunk!  Hey!  Who wants French toast?  Well, the duck…  Uh, well he did not get sick somewhere in there and it was immediately found and properly cleaned up!  Yes it is perfectly good, and it is not one of the places the duck got sick!  I don’t know! But he did not eat your face cream!  Sweepin’. Why? Turn you on?  Huh. What if I was sweeping a chimney?  Where are you going? The vicar won’t be home for hours.  Yeah I did!  Okay, look I’m sorry, I went in there to take a nap and I know I shouldn’t have, but you got porn!  You got porn!  Hey Rach.  Hey Rach, do you smell smoke?  No-no-no, I’m serious. You don’t smell it? Something’s on fire.  Oh, y’know what? It’s probably just your burnin’ loins.  Dude, what are you massaging an old man for?  Gotcha.  Hello, Zelda.  The vicar!  Like a goalie, right?  Huh?

What'd you do, dip it in sugar?  I've literally never been this happy.  Hey.  What?  You can watch our tape if you want.  Oh shout, that would have been fun.

Look I just thought that...  Want us to go?  How's it going?  Fine, whatever.  Nothing. Ok, everything. I think we're calling off the wedding.  My parents called this afternoon to say they weren't coming.  I mean, I knew they were having trouble with this whole thing, but they're my parents. They're supposed to give me away and everything.  And then Susan and I got in this big fight because I said maybe we should call off the wedding, and she said we weren't doing it for them, we were doing it for us, and if I couldn't see that, then maybe we should call off the wedding. I don't know what to do.  You do?  Of course I do.  You're right. Of course you're right.  We're back on.  Thank you.  Hey, what are you doing here?  Ah yeah, but now it’s Susan and me in Mexico and the hostages coming home.  He’s sleeping.  Umm, yeah, actually, Susan’s gonna be home any minute, it’s kinda an anniversary.  It’s not that kind of anniversary.  Sooo!! Anyway...  Oh God, Ross I am so sorry.  Y'know what, I want to talk to you about this so much, but we should probably do it when we could really get into it, are you free for dinner tomorrow night?  Oh, great! Me too.  Ah, Susan will be so pleased.  No. But it’s okay, I’ll just put out pickles or something.  Listen, we both know you’re gonna do it ‘cause you’re not a jerk. Okay? So you can either sulk here for a half hour and then go pick them up, or save us both time and sulk in the car.  Look, I-I-I am sorry that Rachel dumped you ‘cause she fell in love with that Mark guy, and you are the innocent victim in all of this, but don’t punish your friends for what Rachel did to you.  You slept with another woman?  Ahh, nooo!!  You’re a genius, Ross.  Okay, bye!!  Anytime you're ready.  Just aim for the bump.  So don't do it, it's fine. You don't have to do it just because Susan does it.  Look, you don't have to talk to it. You can sing to it if you want.  I did.  No, no that was the first.  I was looking at stuffed animals, and Susan wanted a Chunky.  Let it go, Ross.  Oh, I love them. Each one's like a little party in my uterus.  Am I allowed to drink anything?  Thanks.  You're gonna kill me!  Count faster.  Well, Jamie was the name of Susan's first girlfriend, so we went back to Jordie.  Ow, ow, ow, ow, leg cramp, leg cramp, leg cramp.  All right, that's it.

No, actually, um, we talked about Helen Willick-Bunch.  All right, you two, stop it!  Ross. You're not actually suggesting Helen Willick-Bunch-Geller? 'Cause I think that borders on child abuse.  I know.  He picked it out of the toy store himself, he loves it.  This doesn't have anything to do with the fact that he is being raised by two women, does it?  G. I. Joe. G. I. Joe?!  Oh please God, let there be a song.  Hi honey.  What?  Uhh, we know, he already did it last week.  Actually, he is getting closer on the talking thing.

Anybody else want one?  Oh, listen you guys. I have this friend at Bloomingdale's who's quitting tomorrow and he wants to abuse his discount. So, anyone want to come with me and take advantage of it?  Great.  So.  I know, I probably shouldn't even tell you this, but I'm pretty much totally intimidated by you.  Yes. Oh my god, are you kidding? Ross is so crazy about you, and I really wanted you to like me, and, it's probably me being totally paranoid, but I kinda got the feeling that maybe you don't.  Oy.  Thanks. Hey, listen, would you like to go to a movie sometime or something?  I'd love it too. Shoot, I gotta go. So, I'll talk to you later.  Oh, thanks, sweetie.  Really?  You don't think they'll judge and ridicule me?  Hi, honey.  Good.  What?  Hello Skidmark.  That’s why you broke up with me?  Yeah, we figure it'll live with Ross half the time, and with me half the time.  Hi, but I'm not here, you haven't met me. I'll make a much better first impression tomorrow when I don't have 20 hours of cab and plane on me.  Oh my god.   And the spitting?  We're on this bus, that's easily 200 years old...   ...and this guy...  Well, Ross and I were in grad school together.  And then we've gotta get some sleep.  I was thinking of doing it a little shorter, you know, like Andie McDowell's new haircut?  Really?  Hey.  Um, oh, I don't know. I mean, it's definitely weird not being with Ross, but I guess I'm doing OK. Actually I've got some of his stuff that he, um....  Hi.  Hi. Is this your first?  Well, little Jamie here is our third. So, if you have questions or you need anything at all, just holler.  Yeah, we are going to share every moment of this with you. And I think we’re gonna have some fun.  Oh honey, I think I’m having one too!  Have you felt Rachel’s cervix Ross?  Well, if you like you can feel Rachel’s and then feel mine to compare.  You know, in some cultures having a third nipple is actually a sign of virility. You get the best huts and women dance naked around you.  Where you goin'?  See you later Rach.  Yeah?  So is there like a story or do they just stard doing it right. . . oh, never mind.  That saves us a conversation.  What about Julie?  Well, that could take a while.  Well, in a nutshell. . .  And my second grade teacher was Ms. Thomas, and my first grade teacher was Mrs. Cobb.  No Cobb, as in cobb salad.  Well, Ross and I were in grad school together.\"},\n {'character': 'Annabelle',\n  'concatenated_lines': \"Hey, Joey. So did you hear about the new guy?  Nobody knows his name.

He can have his job back.  Really?  Someone in here.  Good one.  Sorry. She thought you were somebody else.  Okay, but only if you give me a drag.  Fellas, these guys were here first.  There you go.  No. No, I haven’t seen him.  He’s getting married tomorrow right?  I wasn’t invited.  Well, I wouldn’t call her a star, but she’s really good. You should check out Inspecther Gadget.  We have red bagels.  I thought you were Chandler. But umm, one of who is over there.  Rachel?!!  Rachel?  Do you remember when you first came here, how you spent two weeks getting trained by another waitress?  ...and after you’ve delivered the drinks, you take the empty tray....  They already do. That’s why they call it the ‘tray spot.’  It’s all right. Sweetheart.  And when you have a second later, I wanna show you why we don’t just trap spiders under coffee mugs and leave them there.  Rachel?  Remind me to review with you which pot is decaf and which is regular.  You would think.  What?!  Do you still work here?  Oh that’s cool, I was gonna fire you anyway.  Yeah, that’s what I drive. I make four bucks an hour, I saved up for 350 years!  I um, was sorta thinking about maybe...  What?  Okay, here are the tips for this morning. Jen gets 50, 50 for me, and Joey owes eight dollars.  For all the free food you gave away.  We don’t give anything away unless it’s someone’s birthday.  No!  You’re paying for that.  You’ve sung Happy Birthday to 20 different women today!  You are no longer authorized to distribute birthday muffins.  I’m sorry. Was I not supposed to?  Rachel?  When's your birthday?  Oh, I-I'm just making a list of people's birthdays.  What?  Rachel?  I don't know if you heard about what happened between me and Phoebe the other day_  Well, we kissed. I-I-I didn't initiate the kiss, but-but I also didn't stop it, and I've been feeling guilty.  So umm, are we cool?  I knew you'd understand.  HA!  HA!

But, before I can say ‘good-bye’, there’s something I really need you to know, Chandler. The way I feel about you, it’s like, I finally understand what Lionel Richie’s been singing about. Y'know, I mean what we have, it’s like movie love, you’re my soulmate, and I can’t believe we’re not going to be spending the rest of our lives together.  What?  No, you were right, you were right. I mean, I-I-I’ve got to give my marriage another chance.  Honey, honey, people are looking.  Janice has a question. Who of the six of you has sleep with the six of you?  Come on over the years none of you ever y'know, got drunk and stupid.  I’m sorry I find it hard to believe that a group of people who spends as much time together as you guys do has never bumped uglies.  Okay, okay, well then answer me this. Has any of you ever.... almost?  Uh-oh-okay. Uh-oh-okay. I know what you all are thinking. But Chandler is in Yemen! I'm a young woman! I have needs! I can't wait forever!  So I'm asking you please, take a moment before you judge me.  Actually, I should get going.  Yes! Yes! You did!  What is wrong now?!  I know! I know! And then you lose your apartment! And then you lose your job! And then your ex-wife gets married so fast! And now the coffee—ahh!! Ross, we need to talk.  No-no-no, no. I'm going to talk. I believe that the sun has set on our day in the sun.  Well yeah!!  Are you gonna be okay?  Okay.  So, who’s the lucky guy?  Oh. Oh I just cannot believe Clark stood me up!  Oh, what are you, stupid? It’s been three hours.  I should just go on to happier things, okay? Umm, why don’t you tell about your lovely wedding?  Oh…wait…you two think of me as family?! Oh, I have to ask you something now and be honest; do you want me to sing Careless Whisper or Lady In Red?  Chandler?  Please, it’s because otherwise I really don’t know what I might do.  Hey you guys, umm do either one of you want to get in there before I take my bath.  Why not?  Why?  He does?  Wait! Wait! I wanna see this. After I divorce him, half of that kingdom is gonna be mine.  Oh, I cannot believe he’s using our divorce to sell mattresses.  Oh my God.  Oh.... my.... God.  Oh.... my.... God.  By the way, Chandler. I cut you out of all my pictures. So if you want, I have a bag with just your heads.  Oh, are you sure? Really? Because you know, you could make little puppets out of them, and you could use them in your theater of cruelty.  Just us.  Although, I have enjoyed the fact that, uh your shirt's been stickin' outta your zipper ever since you came back from the bathroom.  So, do we have the best friends or what?  I will go for that drink.  Each.  Happy Valentine's Day!  Oh, I miss you already. Can you believe this happened?  Kiss me!  Hi, Monica.  This is so fun. This is like a reunion in the hall.  Hello, funny Valentine.  Hello, Joey, our little matchmaker. I could just kiss you all over, and I'm gonna!  I brought you something.  I had them made special.  That's fine.  Mmm-hmm. Because I know that this isn't the end.  No, it isn't, because you won't let that happen. Don't you know it yet? You love me, Chandler Bing.  Well then ask yourself this. Why do you think we keep ending up together? New Year's? Who invited who? Valentine's? Who asked who into whose bed?  You seek me out. Something deep in your soul calls out to me like a foghorn. Janice, Janice. You want me. You need me. You can't live without me. And you know it. You just don't know you know it. See ya.  Oh, my god, I am so glad you called me. I had the most supremely awful day.  What?  Well, I knew you had the Rockys, and so I figured, you know, you can wear Bullwinkle and Bullwinkle, or you can wear Rocky and Rocky,or, you can mix and match, moose and squirrel. Whatever you want.  Ow!  Ow. Um, it's just my lens. It's just my lens. I'll be right back.  I….can’t….believe this!  Oh y’know what? You have to speak very loudly when you’re talking to Sid, because he’s almost completely deaf.  So? Congratulations you two, I didn’t even know you got married.  What?!  Why?!!  Chandler Bing!  Oh, this should be easy. I have a very wide pelvis. You remember Chandler.  It’s you. This is yours.  He’s a keeper. How are you feeling?  Can I just say, I really admire what you’re doing. Just raising her all alone.  Oh, sure. Now. But what happens when he meets somebody else and gets married?  I’m telling you Rachel, listen to Janice. They all say they’re gonna be there until they start their real family.  Oh well that’s what I thought about my first husband, now I’m lucky if my kid gets to spend the weekend with her father and the twins and little Ms. New Boobs.  Oh hi!  Say hello to Aaron, your future son-in-law.  I’m gonna leave the three of you alone.  OH MY GOD!!  Ah ahahahhahaa! How great is this!  Well, Sid and I are trying again and we had trouble last time because apparently we...  Oh! Sid is still in his room. I don't allow porn at home so this is like a vacation for him. So did you do it? Did you make your deposit?  That's not the hard part honey! The hard part is what comes next, I mean aren't you worried about the results?  Oh! Well, you know what? It probably is.  Oh, Chandler, look. You and Monica are meant to have children. I am sure it's gonna be just fine.  What, you can do it in the parking lot of a Taco Bell, but you can't do it at a doctor's office?  Night-night Bing-a-ling.  Oh. God, crazy Chandler. He spun me...off...the...bed!  You know what, where he hugs you and kinda rolls you away and... Oh... my....God.  Oh my God!  What a small world!  Well... I just talked to Sid, we are definitely putting in an offer on the house... a-a-and I'll bet we get it.  Huh?  Oh... my...  Chandler, what are you talking about?  I don't know what to say... I mean, you know, obviously we have this... heat between us.  But I love my husband. And I know you love your wife. Now, I don't think we should get this house now.  Chandler, one of us has got to be strong.  Oh, no. Oh, no.  Oh, my, god.  Helloo!!  Hey, it's everybody.  Yes, I am.  Is it yours? Ha! You wish, Chandler Bing. You are looking at a married lady now.  Oh, sweetie, I'm sorry.  And what? Missed the expression on your face? Janice likes to have her fun.  Oh well, I’m divorced.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye-bye.  Oh boy, I just love to sing!  I know! And I’m just getting out of a marriage, I mean talk about meant to be!  Oh, too soon, too schmoon. Face it honey, I am not letting you get away this time.  When?  Ugh, well I will just have to soak up every once of Chandler Bing until that moment comes.  Ohh, well when you said all you were going to be doing between now and the time you leave is packing, you didn’t really leave me much choice. Did you?  Okay, Chandler, come on!  Oh please. Every moment is precious. Y’know? Besides, somebody had to ride in that other taxi with the rest of your luggage, and your friends don’t really seem to care too much that you’re leaving.  On no! No! It’s not good-bye, I’m not leaving until you get on that plane.  What’s the matter? Is something wrong? Do you have to stay?  Oh, my Bing-a-ling. I’ll wait for you. Do you even know how long you’re going to be gone?  Chandler?  Chandler!  No! No! I wanna see you take-off.  What is the great tragedy here? You go get yourself another appointment.  So, how come you wanted to eat in tonight?  Oh, you didn't have to do this.  Well, I gotta buy a vowel. Because, oh my Gawd! Who, would've thought that someday, Chandler Bing would buy me a drawer.  We should?  You probably want us to move in together?  What are you doing here?  Are you being British?!  Why are you shopping here? You don't live in this neighborhood. Were you here waiting for me?  Barley? What kind of party serves barley?  Where is this party?  Who's party is it?  What woman?!  Oh, I wish. Look, honey, you have that report to finish, and I gotta go see my lawyer.  I'll see you later, sweetie. Bye Joey.  So, I hear, you hate me!  A little birdie told me something about you wanting to rip your arm off and throw it at me.  All right, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, we've got to do something about our little situation here Joey. So, this is my idea: you and me spending some quality time together.  For Chandler!  Okay. All right. This is what we're gonna call it: 'Joey and Janice's DAY OF FUN!'

She asked me if she could finish off my peanuts, I thought she said something else, we had a big laugh. Yeah, I just, I mean I got, I got tired of waiting.  I guess you can.  All right.  Yeah, sure. Good luck!  What?  Why would you say that?  You’re good. You’re good!  Listen, can you promise me that you won’t tell her though?  Thanks a lot.  So you like it?  Nooo. Uh-huh, no way. What? No.  What?  Now, nooo! I’m just excited about the restaurant, that’s all.  Okay, I love you. Is that so bad?  Look, the only who stands to get hurt is me. And I’m okay with that.  What?  Okay, yeah. I mean... If that’s, if that’s really what you want, okay.  I’m sorry things didn’t work out...  ...so y'know, that’s why, within a few years, that voice recognition is gonna be pretty much standard on any computer you buy. Y'know, so you could be like-like, ‘Wash my car.’ ‘Clean my room.’ It’s not gonna be able to do any of those things, but it’ll understand what you’re saying.  Yeah, it was.  What like Pete Dakota?  I got to go, so ah, I’ll see you guys later.  Where are we?  Just tell me the truth.  Oh, yeah. Wasn’t that like a year ago?  Oh, yeah. I know that.  But you’re not. Okay, good.  Y'know what, don’t be. This is not, don’t be, ‘cause it’s not so bad.  Hey Monica, how's it going.  Well don't forget that fiches over there by Rachel.  I see him, you guys are just the worst hiders ever.  Okay, I love you.  So ah, there was this thing I wanted to talk to you about.  Well ah, I’ve been doing a lot of thinking, and I look at my life…  And I feel like I’ve conquered the business world, and I feel like I’ve conquered the intellectual world, and now I-I have the most beautiful woman in the world.  There’s one thing missing.  It’s time for me to conquer the physical world.  I want to become the Ultimate Fighting Champion! It’s the most intense physical competition in the world, it’s banned in 49 states!  Okay, my trainer, Ho Chi, is teaching me a combination of Gee Koon Doe and Brazilian street fighting, I’ve even had my own octagon training ring designed.  Yeah. Monica, I want you there in the front row when I win. I want you close enough to smell the blood. What do you think?  Well ah, the short version is, I ah pursued her for a couple of months, then I gave her a check for 20,000 dollars, and she was mine.  Yeah, a slice of cheesecake and-and a date if you’re given’ ‘em out.  Hmm, come on, you just said to her that you….  Ho-ho, I will.  Okay, that’s great, but can we make it smaller? Can we make it fit on the head of a pin? I love when we make things fit on the head of a pin.  Well, y’know, I never know how much to tip.  Come on, you gotta admit that our relationship is ah, is hitting a new level now. ‘Cause you used to be like the chef, and I was the customer, and now we’re like this-this couple that fights.  Why not?  One meal! That’s all I’m asking for. Please? We go out, we eat, and if you don’t have a good time, I give you ten grand, we call it even.  Hi.  Hey, you like pizza?  I know a great little place.  You’re, hey, you’re not paying for the pizza!  Ahh, I’d throw another thousand on that.  That’s about 60 cents.  I told you, we’re adding new operators all the time. Could we concentrate on my training?  I promise.  Yeah.  Don’t worry, Hoshi taught me how to use an opponent’s strength and weight against him.  Uh-oh.  It would be nice after hearing 20,000 people chant “You suck!”  What, look back?  Well let me ask you a question. Am I the Ultimate Fighting Champion?  Well I’m not gonna stop until I’m the Ultimate Fighting Champion.  Let me tell you a story. When I set out to create Moss 865, do you think it just happened overnight? No. There was Moss 1, that burnt down my Dad’s garage, there was Moss 2 that would only schedule appointments in January, and 862 others that I learned from, just like I learned from this fight, never to let a guy stand on my neck.  Look, I’m gonna get better. Okay? I promise you.  Oh, one other thing. Hoshi thinks that you being ringside may have affected my concentration.  It’s okay, it’s not as bad as it looks, it’s a precaution. Ah, I’m not supposed to move my spine.  I can’t until I’m the ultimate fighter. I will do it. I’m telling you, the day will come when children will argue over who will win a fight, me or Superman. Now, I’m not saying I could beat Superman, but y'know, kids are stupid.  Y'know I have a torn rotator cuff, a hairline fracture in my right forearm, and a severely bruised Adam’s Apple, but that really hurt.  Well if you’re asking me to quit, then you’re asking me to be someone I’m not. I’ve got to do this.

In fact when we were building houses in Uruguay, we were, we were just two towns apart and we never met.  Sure.  She’s helped so many people to quit smoking.  Oh right, you’ve got a church group meeting tonight.  What?  She told me she was 25.  I am so stupid. Of course she was lying! She’s not a teacher.

And we’ll need to have witnesses who can testify that you were not of uh, sound mind.  And we’ll need you and Rachel to testify before a judge.  Of course you did. Look Ross, you can’t get an annulment unless you and Rachel are both there.'},\n {'character': 'Clerk',\n  'concatenated_lines': 'Six dollars, please.  How can I help you?

You’ve got panties stuck to your leg.  It’s good to see you.  I missed this.  So, you wanna get a hamburger or something?  Oh. Look, just friends, I won’t grope you. I promise.  No it’s not too soon, I had lunch at a eleven.  So when people complement me on my cooking should I, what do I say?  Ew, this feels very weird.  Okay.  Tomatoes are squishing.  Op.  Yeah.  What?  I’ll just throw them out.  You really sure?  Absolutely, this will just be something we do, like racquetball.  You want me to cancel it?  Okay.  Hello.  Ah well, this is the living room.  All right. This is the kitchen.  Um-hmm.  Well, you seem fine.  You mean like exclusive friends?  Wow. Y'know we’re back where we were. Honey, I would love to do all that, but nothing’s changed.  Okay, okay, one thing’s changed. But we still want different things and we know how this is gonna end.  I know I couldn’t. So....  You too, you let uh, your hair grow long.  Well, my nose got lonely.  Oh. Good to see you guys.  And-and then I sneak out and before Monica can her parents come in.  Hi!  Actually, I’m not here to complement the chef.  Well, it was great seeing you the other night.  I still love you. And I know I probably shouldn’t even be here telling you this, I mean you’re with Chandler a guy I really like, and if you say he’s straight I’ll believe you! After seeing ya the other night I knew if I didn’t tell ya I’d regret it for the rest of my life. Letting you go was the stupidest thing I ever did.  Well yeah, I’m sorry. I know this is the wrong time and the wrong place but I had to tell ya! I wanna spend my life with you. I wanna marry you. I wanna have kids with you.  I know this is crazy but am I too late?  Well I know I was an idiot! And I tried to forget you, I really did! Y’know after we had lunch last year I spent six months in Africa trying to get you out of my head!  Working with blind kids.  Okay that’s fine, I’ll walk away. And I’ll never bother you again, but only if you tell me Chandler’s willing to give you everything I am.  You are?  Why?  Hi.  I didn’t ask. You wanna come in?  Uh, no! No! That’s…art! If it bothers you I can put my art out.  So Monica let me ask you a question. Y’know, since we broke up do you ever, think about me?  Oh really?  Who is it?  Ahh.  Excuse me?  Yeah! You’re saying, you need to be with someone more mature. Maybe someone with, a license to practice medicine. Or a mustache.  I think that’s fair.  Chandler.  She’s not here and please come in.  Okay, she was here, but she left.  Well she said she had to think things over.  Oh, hey look nothing happened.  Well all right, one thing happened?  Well I’m sorry.  Well, apparently I’m willing to offer her things that you are not.  Well if it helps, it worked very well.  Happy birthday.  I am not telling you guys anything.  Jack, would you let it go?  Guys. Seriously, it is not like that.  How ya doin'?  Really? I'm a hero.  Yeah, I know. I hate it too. Look, maybe we should just tell them.  My parents are dead.  I know, I know. Just hang in there, OK. OK, I'll go out first, alright.  What?  Humm, really?  Uhh, not that I know of.  That - that's an idea.  Oh?  It is Judy.  She's not a twinkie.  Really?  No, it's been a long time since your dad and I went running.  Very tasteful.  What're we looking at? That blue freckle?  Phoebe's got another job, right?  Um, we should go too, I got patients at 8 in the moring.  I don't know, I don't have my jammies.  Oh, thank you Phoebs. That's very sweet.  Hear that? She likes me best, and apparently there've been a lot.  Night Richard. Good luck Mon.  Two.  Well, I mean what can I say? I, I was married to Barbara for 30 years. She was my high school sweetheart, now you, that's two.  Woah, woah, no wait a minute now. C'mon it's your turn. Oh c'mon. Ya know, I don't need the actual number, just a ballpark.  That's it? That's the giant number you were afraid to tell me?  Well, that's not bad at all. I mean, you had me thinkin it was like a fleet.  Oh honey, I'm fine.  What? Alright, what about my two?  Right, and...  Honey, you are not an oat. I, I mean I don't know, I, I guess I'm just not an oat guy. I've only slept with women I've been in love with.  Right.  Monica.  Hey. They're just trying to decide somehting.  No.  I have a little comb.  A moustache comb.  No. You have got it completely wrong. John Savage was deerhunter, no legs, John Voit was coming home, couldn't feel his legs.  Shall we?  Uh, in the future, if I could see the schedule beforehand...  Hey.  Ohh, brisk tonight.  Let's never speak of this.  Ooh, then I guess the panty raid last night was totally uncalled for. Ok, I am going to take a shower and today I will be singing Jim Crochee's Leroy Brown.  What're you doing?  Are you remaking the bed?  Then, you're redoing it because...  You're pretty much running that risk either way.  Oh, well that's not so crazy.  Oh, alright.  Actually, if it's possible, I love you more.  Ooh, duct tape. Was I supposed to bring something too?  You're strict.  You know, I like the way you have efficiently folded this tab under. See in a tape emergency you could shave valuable seconds off your time.  If it's not a right angle, it is a wrong angle.  Thank you.  You're gonna do what to my clocks.  Well, I'm confused. I thought we shared time.  Because it's in a slightly different time zone than the kitchen.  No come on. Come on tell me.  Come on.  No that's not true. That is not true.  Yeah.  Ok. Ahh. One of my things is, I always separate my sweat socks from my dress socks.  Boy I would just uh, I would freak out.  See, if anyone overheard that, I didn't come off well.  Monica, wake up. Monica.  I thought of a thing.  Yeah. I have to sleep, have to, on this side of the bed.  Or so I would have you believe.  Hey come on, you haven't heard my reason yet.  Ok, I have to sleep on the west side because I grew up in California and otherwise the ocean would be on the wrong side.  Yeah. How 'bout that.  Nice to meet you Joey.  No I didn’t.  I think I lost. Three times.  Yeah, sure.  No, we still have food in the basement! I saw potatoes and some dry pasta!  Just the last two pages.  I found the picture!  Could you uh, could you lower your script? I need to see your face so I can uh, play off your reaction.  Oh, thanks.  Well of course I am!  Great!  I found the picture!  The picture of my wife! In your pack!  Why do have a picture of Paulette in your pack?!  Oh you’re awesome! And, in that last speech? You soaked me.  I’m wearing two belts.  No!  All right.  That can be arranged.  Of course! I’m-I’m sorry. I-I’d hate you to miss anything like that on account of me. I can do this!  You wouldn’t happen to have a very big fork?  Well have we finished the scene?  As were you.  Why? Are we done for the day?  It was great seeing you the other night.  Noo! I came down here to tell you something else. I came here to tell you I still love you.  Oh, yeah, I don't like you this way. All right, I'll see you guys later.  I love you, too.  Awww! You know that's probably why babies learn to talk, so they can tell grown ups to cut it out.  Okay.  Sure I do.  Honey, you are in it.  Oh, yeah!  Well, uh, sometimes I think about selling my practice, we could move to France, make French toast.  Like a hound?  You really need the bassinet?  Oh, hey. I love children, I have children. I just don't want to be 70 when our kids go off to college, and our lives can finally start.  Look I want you, now.  Neither am I.  Okay, I'll do it.  If kids is what I takes to be with you then kids it is.  If I have to I'll, I'll do all again , I'll do the 4 o'clock feeding thing, I'll go to the P.T.A. meetings, I'll coach the soccer team.  Yeah, if I have to. Monica, I don't wanna lose you, so if I have to do it all over again, then I will.  But you're not.  God. I love you.  I guess we just keep dancing.  Monica's making us watch Old Yeller.  Uh, Phoebe, I don't think your mom would want you to see what's about to happen.  Wow. Well being a huge Knicks fan myself, I think you should take someone who's a huge Knicks fan.  Hey, you're gettin' better. I'm gonna keep this by the way.  Hey Phoebs, what's happening?  Charlotte who?  Uh, the guy was Lou Gehrig. Didn't you kinda see it coming?  Hey, be right there.  It's the basketball playoffs.  Oh, no, honey, I mean, don't worry, I like hanging out with those guys. It's fun for me. They're different than my other friends, they don't start sentences with, 'You know who just died shoveling snow?'  Uh, it's the college playoffs.  Uh, they're not in it.  But... he gets it back, pass to the middle, lines it up and... BAM! Yes! Could that shot BE any prettier?  Well, we had a table in college.  Nice moustache by the way. When puberty hits that thing's really gonna kick in.  Ok, just one more point.  Is everything all right?  Uh-oh.  Well.  Uh, you guys see me as a dad?  Uh-huh, yeah.  That's fine. Well, your other dad and I are gonna go have a romantic evening and I guess I'll just see you kids around.  Yeah, just, I feel like I'm about a hundred. I thought I was just one of the guys.

Oh, wait, no your right, no it was perfect and I can’t believe that I screwed it up so bad.  Well, no, maybe-maybe it wasn’t perfect, but y'know it was pretty cool, y'know, ‘cause we had all those great talks y'know.  Well y'know about the tongue thing, y'know, and how I told you about my likes and my dislikes...  How-how I like to melt stuff, and how I dislike stuff that doesn’t melt.  Yeah, y'know I feel like I can really talk to you ‘cause y'know you’re my sister, y'know.  Then I go feel your friend up and make you mad at me.  You hopped a little bit. Yeah, I really sorry.  This?  Oh come on we went, we went to Time Square, we found ninja stars, I almost got arm broken by a hooker...  Well, when I tell my friends about her she will be.  Hi!  How are you?  Oh, well y'know, I would’ve called but I lost your phone number and then ah, my Mom locked me out of the house so I couldn’t find it. And then, I tried to find a pay phone, and ah, the receiver was cut off. So...  Ah, oh, the ah, vandalism.  Well, we got into a fight ‘cause ah, she said I was to immature to get married.  Oh, yeah!  Oh, I knew you’d be so cool about this. All right, ah, hey, do you want to meet her?  Do you?  Well um, I was in ah Mrs. Knight’s ah, I mean Alice, sorry, Alice, I always do that. I was in her ah, Home Ec class.  Yeah, she was my best teacher.  I mean, how hard can it be? Y'know, I mean, y'know, babies, y'know who doesn’t want babies right? And besides y'know, I never had a Dad around, and ah, now-now I always will, ‘cause y'know, it’ll be me. Right?  What, you don’t think I know that?  Okay, but isn’t sex better when it’s with one person that you really, really care about.  You don’t have it anymore?  Okay, so wait, all right, so how does that make things better?  Okay, so what you used to have with Rachel, is what I’ve got with Alice.  It’s so cool man, it’s so, it’s just ‘cause being with her is so much better than like not being with her.  You can have it!  It’s out there man! I’ve seen it! I got it!!  All right, man!!  Oh well, um, your, your laundry just smelled so good, that I thought I’d curl up in it. Is that all right?  Oh, well just probably the worst one since I’ve been alive.  Umm, Alice ah, she ah, called it off.  Uh, no, not really, just that I was too young, y'know, but I don’t see how I could all of the sudden be too young, ‘cause I’m older than I was when we first got together.  Yeah, if the best is like unbelievable pain!  Y'know, I just was finally happy y'know. For the first time in my life! After my Dad left me, and then, and then getting arrested for stealing those birds, and then, and then the whole punctured lung thing! I can, it’s still really hard to take deep breaths in cold weather, but with Alice all that stuff kinda went away. And now it’s, and now it’s gone and I don’t know why!  What?  Wait a minute, wait, this is because of you?  Well, you, wait no, my Mother didn’t want us to be together, but the worst thing she ever did was tie me to the porch.  Wait, y'know what, I-I came to you because I thought you’d understand! Oh no!! Y'know, I would storm out of here right now if-if I had some money, or a place to go…  Hi, Mrs. Knight.  Hey lady. Hey wait up. How do you know my dad?  Heavy.  No but he didn't really talk about anything.  Except stilts.  Yeah, he loved stilts. One time I was upstairs, I was stealing cigarettes out of my mom's purse, and uh, all of a sudden I look over and there's my dad's head bobbing past the window. He just had this big smile on his face and he was waving 'cause he was always happiest when he was on his stilts.  Yeah.  Me neither. So you're like my big sister.  This is huge, you can buy me beer.  I gotta friend named Mark.  Cool, alright. So maybe, ya know, I could give you a call sometime, we could talk or somethin'.  Alright.  Ok, yeah.  Yeah hey, you know if you want I can take you around back and show you where he hit his head on the rain gutter.  Well, okay, so what’s now—go get, go get the eggs, put ‘em in there.

That\\'s great. What kind of music do you play?  Do you think that maybe, sometime, I could...  Okay. Do you think maybe sometime I could take you out?  Phoebe called me.  Look, if I wanna see Phoebe and she wants to see...  Oh! Sorry, I guess I was thrown off by the mention of my name!  Actually I\\'ve been playing a lot of love songs lately. I\\'ve missed you.  I\\'ve missed you so much! No, I\\'m not gonna ask you to get back together because I know we want different things, but just to be with you one more night.  It can\\'t be any harder than this... I mean, If I had known the last time I saw you would be the last time, I... I would have stopped to memorize your face, the way you move, everything about you. If I had known the last time I kissed you would have been the last time... I never would have stopped.  Oh, crap!  My friend Manny. I asked him to keep me away from you.  Hey!  Oh, I made a little something. If I had more time to work on it, it\\'d be better, but..  Seriously. Wanna make one of those?  Really?  Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa! Is this, hot Rachel, that you took to the Christmas party, Rachel?  Oh wow! I’m free for her!  Hey, Chandler, why don’t we talk this over at the Ranger game tomorrow?  Maybe, before the game we could enjoy some eight year old some small batch Basel Hadens.  Hello?  Who is this?  Look, if Phoebe wants to marry David, she should, I\\'m not gonna stand in the way of that and neither should you.  Hi Phoebe.  I have a question I need to ask you.  Yeah, I understand, but before you do, she really needs to hear this.  Actually yeah, that\\'ll be great.  Phoebe, I love you. I mean, I missed you so much these last few months and I thought we were apart for a good reason, but then I suddenly realized that there was no reason good enough to keep me from spending the rest of my life with you.  Sorry David, but she really has to know this.  We can have any future you want.  Is it ok if I hug you now?  Oh... I\\'m back!  They have a game room downstairs! Ping pong and stuff.  I\\'ll play ya!  Oh, by the way... I\\'m awesome!!  You\\'re ready to play?  Wanna make it more interesting?  Ten bucks a game?  I\\'ll make it a hundred!  To see who goes first, you got a quarter?  Oh, no! I don\\'t think so! You know, according to standard table tennis rules if at any time a player uses his non racket bearing hand to touch the playing surface he or she forfeits the point.  Do you?  Do you?  DO YOU?  You know, you should really look in a mirror before you call yourself that.  That\\'s what I\\'m thinking.  Ok, so it\\'s a tie again, 41 to 41.  So you forfeit?  Oh, that\\'s ok. I don\\'t care which of them I beat.  Ok!  This is nice.  You need both hands for that?  Is it?  It\\'s to my apartment.  Yeah, look, and I don\\'t want you to feel like you have to give me your key just because...  Is this cool, huh?  So... how many guys have your key?  Your lipstick\\'s on his mouth.  Did you uhm...  ...kiss him?  Don\\'t point your finger at me.  Well, if I ever goto Minsk, you\\'d better watch out.  Well, I might.  Hey, what are you kidding me?  It\\'s never gonna happen again right?  Thanks for coming you guys.  Is that why your hand is pressed against my crotch?  Yeah.  Hey guys, how is it going?  Yeah look, about tomorrow, I... I\\'ve got a question for ya. I just found out that one of my groomsmen had had an emergency and can\\'t make it.  You both wanna do it? Uhm... there\\'s only room for one.  Yeah, yeah. Hey, thanks for doing that.  I intend to marry her.  No more so than acting.  You\\'re right. She probably will support me. Hey, unless we move in with you, dad?  Do I have a minute to go to the bathroom?  Is that what you say to Chandler?  Hey.  Joseph.  Joey, I kinda have a lot to do today, what do you want?  That must have been one lousy movie.  Uhm, did you guys know that there is a giant ice sculpture in the hall?  Hey, I forgot my scarf.  Oh, you haven\\'t picked yet. Oh good, \\'cause I had an idea. I thought it would be fun if the third groomsman was my family dog. Chappy.  I think I wanna get married to you today.  I guess.  Oh, no!  My God! Aren\\'t you freezing?  I love you too.  I do.  Bye.  Eh, why don\\'t we start with the beer?  Yeah.  My cousin\\'s a paleontologist.  Well, yeah.  Ah, you mean lager.  Hello?  Uh, no.� I just left.  Wha . . .?� Go back?� To the \"land where time stands still\"?  I can\\'t do that!  Hey buddy.  Um, can I come back in?  So, except for the fermentation process, beer and ale are basically the same thing.� Fascinating isn\\'t it.  It\\'s true.� I did.  No.� Just his mom.  Yeah.  Hey.  And there is Kevin.  Oh, it\\'s just... It\\'s up to you. It\\'s your name. You\\'ve got to live with it.  You\\'re a strange kind of grown-up.  Woo-wo-hey-hey-hey... Can we not talk about that right now?  Ah! I missed you  So, what\\'s new?  That\\'s great! You changed you name?  You really did that?  Yeah, but you can\\'t do that.  Crap Bag.  No, no Mike, just Crap Bag. First name Crap, last name Bag.  I do love it, and I love your name. I love Princess Consuela.  After you, miss Banana Hammock.  Oh! Why don\\'t you introduce me?  Why don\\'t you tell her my name?  If you need an easy way to remember it, just think of a bag of crap.  Only if you\\'ll be Phoebe Buffay.  Really?  Do you even know what a banana hammock is?  It\\'s a Speedo.  Oh, figuring out our wedding plans.  I heard that weddings are like a 40 billion dollar a year industry.  Are you serious?  Completely anonymous. From two kind strangers.  Not necessary.  And \"X\" is spelled uhm... \"Mike Hannigan\".  It does. It feels really good!  We’re seriously asking for our money back?  Yeah! This feels really good.  She could have been talking about either one of us.  You never told me about that guy on your sweet sixteen. Oh, ugh. I\\'m sorry about  Well, hey, at least you\\'re getting a proper wedding. I mean, you really deserve that.  No! No, no. I see where this is going. Don\\'t make me go back there.  Alright, fine. We\\'ll give the money back.  No, no, we\\'re here to give the money back.  What?  Well, I mean... It sounds good to me. And that way we can save up, come back in a few years and make an even bigger donation.  I FEEL THE SAME WAY!  Really?  Great game, huh?  Why do you keep looking at the screen?  Going go to the bathroom.  Why?  But please, let\\'s just forget the whole thing.  No! It\\'s my fault. I keep trying to propose in these stupid ways and all I wanna do is tell you that I love you and I want to spend the rest of my life with you.  I\\'m gonna do this now.  Phoebe, I...  Ready?  Phoebe, I love you. There\\'s no-one else in the world I would ask to marry me... three times. But I wanna take care of you, have babies with you, and grow old with you... Phoebe Buffay, will you marry me?  I love you!  I haven\\'t been home in a couple of days and I need to get some more clothes.  I put that tube top on as a joke.  I want to stay too but I\\'ve gone as bad as much use out of these boxers as I can..  No, no! What I mean is, I hate going back to my apartment now... and partly because I live above a known crack den but... mostly because when I\\'m there, It\\'s just, I really miss you. So.. do you want to move in together?  So we\\'re doing it?  Yeah!  Phoebe and I are moving in together.  I\\'m gonna go to the bathroom.  Yes dear.  You ready to go?  What are you talking about?  Well hey, I wanna ask you about Monica\\'s little \"groomy\" joke.  I get the joke. Sophisticated as it was. Now the thing I wanna say is... maybe we should have talked about this before. Us living together, you\\'re not expecting a proposal, right?  Yeah well, that\\'s the thing. For me it\\'s as far as it can ever go.  Look. Phoebe, I-I love you. Very much. But I never want to get married again.  It\\'s just my first marriage was, you know such a disaster. I kind of lost faith in the whole idea.  At one point near the end she deliberately defecated.....  Look it\\'s not about who I would marry. And I was certain the first time I got married it would last forever. And I was totally wrong!  Look Phoebe, It\\'s not about you. I just never wanna get married again.  I\\'m sorry. Are you ok with that? Cause if not...maybe us moving in together isn\\'t the best idea.  Trust me, I will never...  Very cool.  No but... You don\\'t want to get married either right?  You wanna get married?  But if you wanna get married why didn\\'t you say something before?  I want to live with you too! Let\\'s do that!  Can we at least try living together? I mean you might change your mind about marriage.  No.  But I don\\'t want this to end.  I can\\'t believe this is gonna end. I guess I\\'ll have my stuff packed up.  Lima.  OK, I don\\'t want to freak you out or anything, but I think I just saw a rat in your cupboard.  What, is he your pet rat?  You can\\'t keep a rat in your appartment! They\\'re extremely unsanitary, and they transmit leptospirosis and hantavirus.  I don\\'t know but they don\\'t sound like spa treatments. You have to get rid of it!  Thank you.  Hey P  Setting rat traps.  No, no, to test his neck strength.  Ok, ok, I\\'ll throw away the traps.  Better think of a new name for him.  Maybe it wasn\\'t Bob, maybe it was a mouse.  Yeah. We have rat babies now.  Hey, when did we become one of those couples whose lives revolve around their rats?  Ok, fine, these rats are our responsibility. What happens when they mate and there are hundreds of them?  Yeah - not such a problem with rats. No, they\\'re more of a \"love the one you\\'re with\" kind of animals.  Well, I know this is gonna sound crazy, but, we could not let the box of rats ruin our lives.  It\\'s gonna be ok.  No, I think you\\'re sweet.  Wow! You look like... like my mom.  No, my parents are rich.  Mom, dad, this is Phoebe. Phoebe, these are my parents: Theodore and Bitsy.  Hey... Wh... What are you doing?  Well, come on...  No, no, no, you\\'re doing fine, really... Why don\\'t you go talk to my dad?  Absolutely! Or maybe just a little less pimp spit.  Uhm... Did you just hit my dad?  But, I mean, you have met... humans before, right? Look, why don\\'t you go talk to my mom?  Awesome!  Phoebe writes lots of great songs. Wha... What was that one you sang the other night that everybody just loved?  Mom, I thought I told you... Phoebe\\'s a vegetarian.  Phoebe you don\\'t have to eat...  Hey, what\\'s going on?  A little better.  I\\'m not interested.  All right, stop! You know, all Phoebe has done tonight is trying to get you to like her. And maybe that hasn\\'t been clear all the time, but she did her best. And yeah... She\\'s a little different than you are...  So what? I mean if even I can get past that, it shouldn\\'t bother you. And you don\\'t have to like her. You just have to accept the fact that I do. I mean, if you even can\\'t be civil to the woman I love...  You do?  Wanna get out of here?  Mom, dad, thanks for dinner.  You should be careful when checking your overhead bins, \\'cause items may shift during...  You don\\'t have to go home tonight, do you?  Oh...  Uhm... I can\\'t do anything tonight.  I have a date.  Oh, it\\'s... my girlfriend.  Yeah... Well, when... you and I broke up I started seeing someone.  Three months.  I\\'ll tell her that it\\'s over tonight at dinner. I promise.  Maybe I\\'ll sign for it. Tear it open. Pull out the packing material...  Hey, it\\'s Mike.  Oh, err... no, she\\'s not here yet. You know, I think I\\'m just gonna take off and break up with her over the phone...  One more thing... There... might be a picture of Precious on my coffee table.  Anyway, I just wanna give you a heads up.  And there is Kevin.  There is a revolutionary new product that guarantees that you\\'ll never have to open up milk cartons again. Meet the Milk Master 2000.  Oh she\\'s my girlfriend. That\\'s not just how we do it here. I got to get a break and when we come back we\\'ve got Kenneth  Well I\\'ve got a book around...  All right, that was Kenneth with his much too literal rendition of \"I touch myself\". Coming up next we\\'ve got Monica  Like an X-Ray. Bad day not to wear a bra.  Sure.  Also a good gift? Underwear.  its Mike Hanagen  Hey, so are you sure your ready to go.  Oh.  Ok, unless you\\'re not gonna try to get me to join a cult are you?  what\\'s up is Phoebe ok?  that\\'s why she was weird.  I\\'m not blowing her off, I actually just got off the phone with her, were going out tomorrow night, I mean I hope that\\'s ok with you stranger from the coffee house.  hey wait wait wait wait wait! Is that true what you said Phoebe\\'s never had a serious relationship?  but you did say it  Vicrum?  But Rachel I thought she just had a baby with Ross  that is so wrong and on top of that his a glue sniffer.  and you don\\'t have to worry about glue sniffing with me. although I do smell the occasional magic marker, yeah ah anyway I just think I can make you happy.  what\\'s wrong?  uh huh  No. well look can I think your weird and also cool for telling me the truth and also wanna kiss you.

Honey I made a reservation at China Garden, is that okay?  It was fine.  I’m thinking that you are looking really fine it that dress.  Are you talking about having sex?  Normal.  Nope! That never happened to me!  Nope.  Okay.  Okay.  When I was six years old.  I wanted a big wheel. And instead my parents got me this little plastic chicken that you hop around on. It was embarrassing; kids made fun of me. That was a pretty tough year.  It was horrible. They called me chicken boy.  Oh, I couldn’t eat now.  Rachel?  No! No! It’s just that, my dad never did. I miss my dad.  Hey Chandler?  Would you…….Would you hug me?  Five more seconds.  Hey! I have so much more to tell ya, I’ve written it all down!  A surfer.  I wanted to be one with the waves, y’know?  What?! I can’t believe you’re trying to stifle me! When just 14 hours ago we figured out that that is exactly what my mother was trying to do to me!  I usually prefer Elizabeth’s boyfriends to address me as Mr. Stevens.  So Ross, what your problem?  Why can’t you get a girlfriend your own age?  I don’t like you going out with my daughter Ross.  Okay.  Fine! Two minutes. Go.  I’m Irish.  No, unfortunately Lizzie’s mom passed away shortly after she was born. I raised her by myself.  I get that a lot.  I had a sister.  She passed away.  Oh, you don’t have to do that every time.  A part of him did yes.  I’m already here.  No.  Just call me Paul.  Well, we were very young when we had her.  I’m just me, my wife died shortly after Lizzie was born.  Yes I did.  Hi Ross.  Yeah Ross it’s okay, it’s me, Mr. Stevens.  So Ross was in college and decided to jump at the chance to take a young girl to her high school prom.  I beg your pardon?  You have a son?  You two were married?!  How to make the next one even shorter?  Well, this is fun. So Ross, did you kill any of these wives?  Are you yelling at me?!  Then we agree?  Neither of us like Ross!  Okay look, Ross, just so you know that since Lizzie likes you so much, I’ve decided to accept the fact that you’re going out with her.  Yeah. But then I changed my mind. I’m funny like that. So I told Lizzie, now I’m telling you, I don’t want you seeing my daughter anymore.  Yes it does.  I’ll call the university and tell them about your relationship and have you fired.  I know. I like it up here.  What’s the matter honey? Did you see a little mouse?  Honey, we don’t have any bears here.  Okay.  I’m so happy that you’re here.  How did you know we were here?  Why are you yelling?  So Lizzie, are-are-are you planning on staying the night?  Good. Good. Not that we don’t want you to stay, obviously you’re welcome—How much more homework do you have?  What do you need from the car?  Ross!  Ross. You and I are going to have to have a little talk.  You’re next!!  Let me just see if I got this straight. I tell you to stay away from my daughter or I’ll have you fired. What you heard was, \"Take my daughter, come up to my country house, and ruin my weekend with Rachel!\"  No, let me explain! Fired!!  Ross, let me show you where the guest room is.  Yeah?  I know, I know, I\\'m such an idiot. I guess I should have caught on when she started going to the dentist four and five times a week. I mean, how clean can teeth get?  Well, you might try accidentally breaking something valuable of hers, say her-  Ooh, steer clear of you.  Ever since she walked out on me, I, uh...  No, it\\'s, it\\'s more of a fifth date kinda revelation.  Isn\\'t there?  It\\'s okay...  Two years.  So you still think you, um... might want that fifth date?  Thank you!  Thank you so much!

He\\'s gonna stay with her and she\\'s going to be all, \"Hi, I\\'m Julie, Ross picked me, and we\\'re gonna to get married, have a lot of kids and dig up stuff together.\"  Oh my god.

Then let me read it.  Come on.  All right, you know what? This isn\\'t funny anymore. There\\'s something about me on that piece of paper and I want to see it.  What is this? Ross, what is this?  Kind of ditzy? Too into her looks? Spoiled?  Just a waitress?  Oh! I do not have chubby ankles!  She is not Rachem. What the hell\\'s a Rachem? Is that some stupid paleontology word that I wouldn\\'t know because I\\'m just a waitress.  Not interested.  No.  That\\'s what I said.

Hey Phoebs, how\\'d it go with Scott last night?  Yeah, but how much can you tell from a look?  Yeah, Monica\\'s settin\\' me up.  Oh what, my whole insane jealousy thing? Well, y\\'know, as much fun as that was, I\\'ve decided to opt for sanity.  Oh yeah, c\\'mon, I\\'m movin\\' on. He can press her up against that window as much as he wants. For all I care, he can throw her through the damn thing.  Together?  Both of you?  Together.  Ohh, well, isn\\'t that just lovely. That\\'s something the two of you will be able to enjoy for a really, really, really, really, really long time.  Cats, how long do they live figuring you don\\'t... y\\'know, throw \\'em under a bus or something?  Oh, no, Michael, it\\'s not you. I\\'m sorry, it\\'s just, it\\'s this thing. It\\'s probably not as bad as it sounds but this friend of mine is, is getting a cat with his girlfriend.  I mean he just started going out with her.  Ah, hah-hah-hah-ho, yeah, he wishes. Oh, I\\'m sorry, look at me. OK, Michael, let\\'s talk about you.  OK, OK. So, you ever get a pet with a girlfriend?  Yes! Thank you.  Oh, you\\'re not having fun, are you?  Oh, look at me, look at me. Oh, I\\'m on a date with a really great guy, all I can think about is Ross and his cat and his... Julie. I just want to get over him. gosh, why can\\'t I do that?  Yeah!

I don\\'t know, I, I feel like I had a dream about you last night but I, I don\\'t remember.  Did we speak on the phone last night? Did you call me?  Huh.  Ohh, ohh.  Ohh, OK, OK, OK, well, basically, lately, I\\'ve uh, I\\'ve uh, sort of had feelings for you.  Yeah, what, so? You had feelings for me first.  Chandler told me.  When you were in China.  Meeting Julie.  Are you over me?  Wait, so, you\\'re going?  OK, OK.  Hi.  Oh, that\\'s um, interesting.  Alright, I got it Ross.  Hey, I was doin\\' great before I found out about you. You think it\\'s easy for me to see you with Julie?  I didn\\'t know then. And how come you never said anything to me.  Right, you, you only had a year. We only hung out every night.  Hey, there was one Italian guy, OK, and do you even have a point?  Yeah, what\\'re you saying, you just sort of put away feelings or whatever the hell it was you felt for me?  Alright, fine, you go ahead and you do that, alright Ross.  \\'Cause I don\\'t need your stupid ship.  And ya know what, now I\\'ve got closure.  Joey, would you slow down?

Bobby and I are going away for the weekend, remember?  Oh no no, this is not for him, this is for me. That way he's still sober but I find his stories about shoelaces much more amusing.  Hi.

No, not wieght... y\\'know, more like insulation.  Oh, um, it was nice. Took him to a romantic restraunt, ordered champagne, nice.  Nope. Zilch, nothin\\', uh-uh.  Look, I, y\\'know, I don\\'t mind taking it slow, I like him a lot, y\\'know he\\'s really interesting and he\\'s really sweet and why won\\'t he give it up?  No, whad\\'ya mean? He\\'s not British.

No, I felt it on my hip. You could tell.  So, I figured it out.  Why Scott doesn\\'t want to sleep with me. It\\'s \\'cause I\\'m not sexy enough.  Really? That\\'s so sweet. I mean, I\\'m officially offended but, sweet.  Hey Joey.  How come you\\'re watching a rabbi play electric guitar?  So, Scott asked me to come over for lunch today and I did.  And we did.  Yay me.  Well, I finally took your advice and asked him what was going on.  He said that, um, he understands how sex can be like, a very emotional thing for a woman and he was just afraid that I was gonna get all, y\\'know, like, \\'ohh, is he gonna call me the next day\\' and, y\\'know, \\'where is this going\\' and, ya know, blah-la-la-la-la. So he said he wanted to hold off until he was prepared to be really serious.  Yeah, so I said, \"OK, relax please,\" y\\'know, I mean, sex can be just about two people right there in the moment, y\\'know, it\\'s, if he wants to see me again he can call and if not, that\\'s fine too. So after a looooot of talking. . . I convinced him.  Um-hum.  Although, you know what? You might want to consider wearing underwear next time. Yeah, cause when you sat down on your throne you could kind of see your... royal subject.  Are... are you OK?  Oh, we were just trying to make Joey feel better.  Fun Bobby is so great.

Hey.  Ohh, ohh, Lorne Green?  Oh, no.  Oh, well, we have to celebrate. You know what we should do? We should do, like, a soap opera theme.  Hey Rach, what time do you get off? We\\'re all gonna do something tonight.  But you guys came so close.  That is funny.  It\\'s not that bad.  OK, OK, don\\'t get all squinky.  Alright, don\\'t say that.

I just heard your speech. We can recreate it! We\\'ve got all night!  And then, and then you said that thing about, about bringing the Mesozoic era in the 21st century.  Yeah.  Actually I did it Ross. You remembered shockingly little of your own speech.  Thank you.  Oh yeah!

No, it\\'s just... I was enganged to a guy who turned out to be gay!  Didn\\'t you feel so stupid that you didn\\'t see the signs? My fiancé was always going away on these long weekends with his tennis partner.  Right and then everybody finds out and they\\'re like: \"Oh, I knew all along\"  I know!  I didn\\'t do that.  I had a great time.  So, shall we?  Bye.  What?  You\\'re... you\\'re kidding, right?  You were incredible!  You blew them away!  I\\'m sorry, I can\\'t! I\\'m running a discussion group all afternoon.  Actually, it turned out to be a lot of fun!  Yeah...  ... is it weird that it\\'s not with each other?  Ross, can I talk to you for a minute?  Uh, well... Joey and I broke up.  Joey is a great guy, but we\\'re just... so different! I mean, during your speech he kept laughing at homo erectus!  Anyway I just, uh, I think it\\'s for the best.  Yeah, can you guys just throw him in the pool later?  Thanks!  Are they still looking for us?  I don\\'t think they did.  I think you know.  All right, all right.  Oh, hi. I\\'m professor Wealer.  It\\'s a... It\\'s good to meet you! Thank you so much for taking the time out to show me around.  And, by the way, I really enjoyed your paper on the connection between geographic isolation and rapid mutagenesis.  Oh, ah, isn\\'t there another professor that is supposed to come with us?  I\\'m pretty sure, professor Spafford from Cornell?  You don\\'t think we should wait for him?  Kinda playing fast and loose with the word \"interesting\".  Oh my God!!  Let\\'s ditch him!  Come on, he\\'s still in the bathroom! I\\'m begging you!  Well, I think he\\'s a little out there, but he does have some interesting ideas...  Oh, Newcastle disease is a secretion borne virus that only affects chickens and... other poultry.  I thought you came to say you were sick.  Actually, I\\'m kinda happy to be leaving... I just broke up with someeone.  Actually, Alby is the guy I broke up with.  Yeah...  Yeah, well, he is a brilliant man.  Yes! And while that is everything one looks for in a boyfriend, he had a lot of issues...  Ok, you want the dirt? Alby was seriously insecure. I mean, he was really intimidated by the guy I dated before him.  A guy who won two.  Yeah... for three years.  No, but he did just win the McArthur genius grant.  So, you know... I have a little time. If you... if you want to...  Oh, Ross, you gave a B to a Pottery Barn catalogue.  Hi!  Nice to meet you.  Oh, you know what? I\\'ll come with you!  You know, actually I\\'m a little surprised to myself. I mean, Joey is so different from the guys I usually date. I mean, they\\'re all professors, and intellectuals, and paleontologists mostly, you know, very cerebral...  Hi!  I\\'m good!  Please, I\\'ve been crazed all day! I had a meeting with the Dean, and my syllabus for summer school is due and I\\'m writing the Foreword for a friend\\'s book...  So I am just so excited to be here. And I can\\'t wait to start exploring the city!  Oh, you mean it? That would be so fun!  Oh, well, we can go see the Chronos Quartet at the Avery Fisher Hall.  And there is a collection of Walt Whitman letters on display at the public library.  And first, I have to see the MET!  No, no, no, not the Mets, the MET, singular!  The museum!  Hi!  The museum was amazing!  Not so much, no. He had clearly memorized all the stuff to say, and some of it didn\\'t even make any sense.  Well, for one, he was talking about paintings that were nowhere around.  No, we went to the left.  Actually, you know, Joey is your friend, and you don\\'t really know me that well; it would be weird.  Well... I\\'m just thinking that maybe he\\'s not the right guy to be with right now, maybe I should be with someone... I have more in common with. You know what I mean?  Yeah, I guess that\\'s true.  He is very sweet. Plus he\\'s hot!  Hey!  Ooh... Dr. Geller!  uhm... Is everything okay?  Ooh... Is it because of what might be on the bedspread, because I saw that news report too, with the infra red and the ... I could just...  I uhm... I completely understand.  Okay...  So, did you talk to Joey?  Yeah, sounds like a good idea... Dr. Geller!  PHD  It\\'s so... something... You go girlfriend!  Not once.  Okay... Good luck.  I\\'m sorry, what?  From... Cosmo??  I\\'m sure you have better things to do.  If you have the time, I\\'d really appreciate the help.  Oh, yeah! Let\\'s do it!  Umh... Kurts Baley?  So you\\'re up for keynote speaker! Who\\'s making the decisions?  He\\'s a pretty tough guy to impress.  See, I told you I needed someone! Oh, you know, by the way, as a \"thank you\", I would really love to take you out.  Yeah! Actually Joey and I are going to the movies tonight, wanna come?  You\\'ve seen all the movies...  Wha, you know, maybe we can do something else!  Oh! trying on clothes.  No! There\\'s nothing to explain. I heard you. Phoebe likes Joey.  It\\'s just that... I don\\'t understand it... I mean, Phoebe likes Joey and then she comes here to buy a dress to impress another guy...?  Wow!  You know, by the way. I heard you tell her not to do anything. Thanks for sticking up for me.

All these feelings are rushing back! I\\'m starting to realize how much I missed her, and I\\'m gonna need you to break up with her.  If you say yes then I\\'m serious, if you say no then I\\'m joking!  Joking it is!  The selection committee has chosen the three of you as our finalists today. The ultimate decision will be based upon the answers you give to the questions I ask here. I\\'m gonna start with Dr. Li. Dr. Li, you claim the field is too reliant on the Linnaean taxonomic system. How do you propose to correct this problem?  Dr. Biely, your proposal includes some field work. Where might that take place?  Certainly. Very well. And Dr. Geller, when is my birthday?  Care to venture a guess?  I see, and Dr. Biely?  Certainly. Dr. Geller, which 1965 Shirelles hit was later covered by a popular British invasion band?  No! I\\'m sorry, we were looking for \"Baby It\\'s You\". Baby It\\'s You.  You\\'re right, I apologize. Scratch the last question. Spell \"Boscodictiasaur\".  Yeah, I just made it up. Spell it.  No, it starts with a silent \"M\".  I\\'ve come here to apologize. I think I may have let my feelings for Charlie interfere with the interview process.  Anyway, I\\'ve decided to offer you the grant.  Well... there is just one small... stipulation...  Hey, you got one right!  Crazy, or... romantic?  Ooor...  Dr. Geller...? Charlie... What are you... what are you doing here?  Like I tried to tell you in the interview Ross, this grant is not based on your knowledge of pretty useless trivia.  Alright, it\\'s true. I behaved horribly. But it\\'s only because I still love you. And I would do anything to have you back in my life.  I never should have broken up with you. I think about you all the time.

I am, but I don’t know you know. An actor of a certain age is not that easy.  I probably should’ve just left years ago when the offers were pouring in, but y’know I just got so comfy here! And… Ohh, I turned down some amazing work!  Well, let’s just say if I left 15 years ago, the landscape of Mexican cinema would be very different today!  Well, you certainly own that room.  Well, it’s nice to know that you…  Oh that explains all the women’s underwear.  Certainly.  I’d love to, but my lawyer said I can’t do that anymore.  Oh no-no-no-no, being adored. I’m used to it, don’t worry about it.  What?  They don’t?  How does it happen?  Ah what?! Jessica hates horses!  Well of course not, but you were very good.  And guess what? Good news! I got another job!  A film in Guadalajara!  Eight months.  Yeah, but you can come and visit me. I bet that you could uh, own a few places down there.  That is a tricky one.

When-when—I mean when…  …I keep a straight face he-he delivers like this look, a reaction to you, or a certain take, I-I—I mean I find it so funny.  Now, we should go back and take the other line.  No! Come on!  The good thing about the young kids though, they’re completely unpredictable. Which is a lot of fun as an actor to respond with. But there was one story…  Where the story was that I was anticipating that I would be around to hear my son’s first words spoken.

Yeah, Rachel, Chandler, and Ross had to try to get a couch up a stair—a very narrow New York stairwell and that was probably…I-I think it was the hardest I’ve-I’ve laughed in my life period.  He’s gone. He’s…  We enjoy watching each other. And I settle for watching each other’s performance, and we like each other.  Well thank you so much.  That is too much!  Phoebe?  Yeah, I’m just, I’m just in town for a conference. Umm, God you look phenomenal!  Yeah. Well I-I got like thirty of them.

And y’know, I didn’t want to intrude on your life or-or anything like that, but I-I really wanted to see you and—but I didn’t know if you wanted to see me.  Really? Because I think about you all the time.  I mean, there’s a statue in Minsk…  That reminds me of you so much, I mean umm, it-it’s actually of Lenin. But, y’know at certain angles…  Umm, anyway…Do you want to have dinner tonight?  Uh no, I have to go in a few hours. I have to be on the red-eye. Well listen, y’know, next time you’re in Minsk umm…  Hey! Oh, I was just about to leave. I-I-I-I didn’t think you were coming.  Oh, I hate this but I-I-I have to go. I-I can’t miss my flight.  Please, clean my beakers. I don’t get out of the lab much.  Yeah, I… Well I really actually wanted to say umm, that, but um, I figured I probably shouldn’t because y’know, I…have to leave.  I-I do though.  Phoebe! Hi!  Wow, you look unbelievable.  Well, I\\'m back from Minsk... permanently.  Well, remember how I was trying to achieve the positronic distillation of subatomic particles?  Well, after eight years of research I discovered that it can\\'t be done.  Good, good, life is good...  Ah well, I-I\\'m seeing someone.  She\\'s also a scientist, so she\\'s very smart and pretty and... well, it\\'s actually because of you, really, that we\\'re together, I mean, I saw what you had with that Mike guy, and I just said \"Boy, I want that\".  You\\'re kidding me. Because I\\'m not seeing anybody, I\\'ve just totally made that up.  Yeah, I don\\'t know why, I\\'m sorry, I guess I just didn\\'t want to lose face.  Yeah, I know.

I mean, someone that I can spend this day with and then his wife comes back into town. I swear, its almost not worth dating married guys.  Oh. I was so looking forward to this. It was going to be such a beautiful Thanksgiving. We were going to have sushi.  Oh my god. You\\'re on Days of Our Lives.  wow. They must put a lot of makeup on you.  Oh. That\\'s a funny noise.  Oh I was just thinking. You know what would be incredible? If you guys died.  no, no, then I would get the baby. I mean you know it would be just like a movie. Like at first I wouldn\\'t know what to do with her, then I would rise to the occasion and and then I would get a makeover and then I\\'d get married.  Well who would?  I don\\'t believe this, hold on a second. You guys die and I don\\'t get your baby?  Connected? I mean.. to what? She\\'s.. she\\'s  a lump.  <points to Chandler> This guy? Seriously?  Its such a slap in the face. I\\'m your sister and you would give your baby to these strangers over me.  No, Ross\\' sister was really fat.  No, she was this really dorky girl in high school that used to follow Rachel around like a puppy dog.  Okay, how about this, you guys die and the crazy plate lady dies, then do I get the baby?  Hurts, doesn\\'t it?  You know.. this.. this is classic Rachel.  This might be my one chance to have a baby Rachel. I mean, you know that I have been so busy focusing on my carrer.  Um.. I\\'m a decorator.  Why can\\'t you ever be supportive?  Oh. Yeah. Well.. You didn\\'t come see me when I was in the hospital when I was getting my lips done.  How hard could it be? You do it.  Do you want to know why you don\\'t want  me to have the baby?  Because you don\\'t want me to be happy. You.. you have always been jealous of me.  Uh.. To name a few.  You know.. You know.. You\\'ve just always been like this. You just have to have everything. And I couldn\\'t have anything. Like in junior high, when you stole Timmy from me. I mean, do you even realize how much that hurt me?  Oh come on, that was 20 years ago. Get over it.  Yeah, well you know what I cannot believe. That my so-called sister, gets a 30% discount from Ralph Lauren and I still have to pay retail.  You bitch. You just think you\\'re so perfect. With your new baby and your, your small apartment. <directs this to Ross who in turns throws the towel in his hand down on the table> Well let me tell you something. Your baby isn\\'t even that cute.  No.  No! What are you going to do? Make me?  So do I.  I do yoga.  Uh, yeah I think I did.  I\\'m sorry.

You do?!  My God what a fantastically well lit hallway!  I must say this apartment, its, its, There are no words…  It’s a haven. A third-floor paradise.

I’ve probably been talking too much. Why don’t we talk about you a little bit?  Come on. I want to know.  I’ve had a really good time tonight.  You know, I rarely connect with someone this much on the first date.  Are you going to eat that bread?  Would you like to move over to the couch?  Maybe I’ll just turn the lights down a little.

I barely had t he nerve to make this call, so you know what I did?  I got a little drunk...and naked.  Oh, you know, the usual, teaching aerobics, partying way too much. Oh, and in case you were wondering, those are my legs on the new James Bond poster.  So, are we gonna get together or what?  Great, I'll see you then.  Hi.  Yes?  How did you--?  Thanks.  Hey, Bob, it's Jade. Listen, I just wanted to tell you that I was really hurt when you didn't show up the other day, and just so you know, I ended up meeting a guy.  Oh, hi.  Yes, yes, I did. In fact, I had sex with him 2 hours ago.  Eh.  Oh, Bob, he was nothing compared to you. I had to bite my lip to keep from screaming your name.  It was just so awkward and bumpy.  Well there really wasn't much time to get used to it, you know what I mean?  Hi, it's me. Listen, Bob. I'm probably way out of line here.

Ok listen, you guys have shown a lot of interest in me tonight and I'm flattered and... and quite frankly a little frightened. Can we just talk about something else?  Ravioli's delicious!  No I didn't.  I'm gonna take off now. You're gonna let me go home, aren't you?  No, no, I should get home, I'm kinda tired.

I don’t know what it is, I just can’t take a good picture.  Yeah, I’m not in that.  How about those three pointers?  Yes, and we call Ross Lingers In The Bathroom.  They have that on the napkins at the club.  Rach, if you have a crush on this guy, why would you hire him? I mean y’know you can’t date him right?  Dude that is so sad.  Could I play?  No, I am.  Oh my God! Those are my bedroom eyes?! Why did you ever sleep with me?  I can’t help it!  Borrow money from me?  Why is there jelly on your shoe?  Hey!  I’m still right here!  Did you have a crush on me, when you first met me?  There I am!  Yeah, Joey said I uh, I needed to relax so he gave me an antihistamine.  Yeah, and then I fell asleep on the subway and went all the way to Brooklyn. Brooklyn is f-far!!  Ahhh.  Oh yeah, that looks good.  Okay.  I’m marrying her.  Well, if you\\'re gonna work for mechanics, those are the ones to work for.  You know, I can\\'t believe you. Linda is so great! Why won\\'t you go out with her again?  Is this still about her whole \\'The Flintstones could\\'ve really happened\\' thing?  ...little playthings with yarn?  Could you want her more?  We\\'re not—we\\'re not saying anything.  And then he did.  There just don\\'t happen to be any women in our games.  OK Phoebs, how many do you want?  Rach, Rach, we gotta settle.  The... Jamestown colony of Virginia. You see, King George is giving us the land, so...  Yes, and I get my ya-yas from Ikea. You have to put them together yourself, but they cost a little less.  Oh, did you get that from the \\'I Love Rachel\\' pizzeria?  Um, ok... the... the fifth dentist caved and now they\\'re all recommending Trident?  Oh yes, yes, we could play some other game... like, uh, I don\\'t know... Pictionary?  That\\'s alright, I\\'ll take it. Bad things happen to me anyway. This way I can break \\'em up with a movie.  Hey, that\\'s... that\\'s \\'joincidence\\' with a \\'C\\'!  Y\\'know, I\\'ve had dates like this.  Call.  Good luck.  Airplane! Airport! Airport \\'75! Airport \\'77! Airport \\'79!  Go.  No, no, no. No-no-no.  No, we\\'re playing this game I learned at work. You have to name all the states in six minutes.  Oh, okay, time\\'s up!  Oh that\\'s not bad, Pheebs?  Okay, so Rachel\\'s got 48 and Phoebe has the lead in…vegetables, Joey?  Look Ross, if you don\\'t know them by now, you will never know them, okay? That is the beauty of this game. It makes you want to kill yourself.  Okay, but if you can\\'t…no dinner!  Sure, and Joey; do not let Ross look at any of the maps or the globe in your apartment.  I don\\'t know. Maybe it\\'s because it smells a little weird. It\\'s like old pumpkins or something.  Which smells delicious!  What?  Tell her, I\\'m allergic, and I will sue!  Huh! Where is the dog?!  Phoebe, we can hear the dog barking!  What is it doing here?  Extremely allergic, okay? If I\\'m anywhere near a dog for more than 5 minutes, my throat will just close up!  Well, it still has to go, right?  Okay, it\\'s um…  They are needy, they are jumpy, and you can\\'t tell what they are thinking, and that scares me a little bit.  Okay, it\\'s just that dogs make me a little uncomfortable.  Why not?  Well, I, I should go in there.  Why not?  Monica\\'s all upset, because I sent Clunkers away.  Yeah, I can be a hero, I could do that. I could, I could do... I, w-w-what if, what if it attacks me?  No, no he went for a walk.  Please, please, please, don\\'t be mad at me.  Clunkers?! Oh my god!  It\\'s up to you.  All right.  Do you realize you get louder each week?  Right. So uh, have you written yours yet?  Do you happen to know what I’m going to say?  I’m so pathetic! Monica knows what she wants to say! You should’ve seen her. Writing, writing, writing!  Yeah, I’m not sure I can do that.  All right, there’s a nuclear holocaust, I’m the last man on Earth. Would you go out with me?  Oh, y’know-y’know what, I was looking at it upside down.  You\\'ll get one.  All right. I\\'ll tell you what. When we\\'re 40, if neither one of us are married, what do you say you and I get together and have one?  Oh, no, no. I just meant hypothetically.  No, no, no.  Nice try.  Look, Monica…  This is not going to work.  You are so great! I love you!  Nothing! I said, I said \"You\\'re so great\" and then I just, I just stopped talking!  No I didn\\'t!  No I didn\\'t!  No I don\\'t! Stop it! Stop it! Stop it! Stop it!   Y’know I was thinking, what if I uh, unpack here?  Well, what if all my stuff was here?  Okay. What if we lived together and you understand what I’m saying?  Oh my God.  I\\'ve had a very long, hard day.  Ahh, no thanks. No chicken, bye-bye then.  Are you okay? I\\'m so sorry, he wouldn\\'t leave. He kept asking me about chicken.  Hey Joe!  It happened in London.  The reason we didn\\'t tell anyone was because we didn\\'t want to make a big deal out of it.  No-no-no-no-no! You can\\'t!  Okay, so now do you believe that she\\'s attracted to me?  Phoebe knows about us!  Ahh yes, the messers become the messies!  Listen, this is totally getting out of hand! Okay? She wants me to put lotion on her!  Oh, you\\'re-you\\'re going?  Not if I kiss you first.  Well, I guess there\\'s nothing left for us to do but-but kiss.  Okay! Okay! Okay! You win! You win!! I can\\'t have sex with ya!  Because I\\'m in love with Monica!!  Yes, and we\\'d appreciate it if no one told him yet.  Who are those people?  What’s going on?  So we both finished our vows.  Don’t worry honey, we’ll make yours funnier.  Okay, what do you guys think?  You really like it?  I stole Monica’s and changed the name.  We\\'re just hanging out by the spoons. Ladle?  Carol? I was just wondering if Joey could ask you a question about breast-feeding?  So, uh, how often can you do it?  Hey, sweetums.  Come on, you\\'re going to Bloomingdale\\'s with Julie? That\\'s like cheating on Rachel in her house of worship.  What did you just do?  What did you just do?  Of course the packaging does appeal to grown-ups and kids alike.  Howdy.  Well, maybe it\\'s because of the way you\\'re dressed.  You\\'re damn right I\\'m right. I say you show this guy what you\\'re made of. I say you stand your ground. I say you show him that you are the baddest hombre west of the lingerie.  All right. Now go see Miss Kitty and she\\'ll fix you up with a nice hooker.  Okay, I’m not gonna have one.  See that is the problem with invisible dentists.  That is so weird, because every time I go to the dentist, I look down the hygienist’s blouse.  Hey! Hold on a minute, hold on a second. Do you think these pearls are nice?  Janice’s birthday is coming up, I want to get her something speacial. Come in here with me.  That’s a good idea, ‘Dear Janice have a Hubba-Bubba birthday’. I would like to get her something serious.  Why not?!  What is the thing?  Well she, she wouldn’t do that, she’s with, she’s with me.  Yeah, well, you’re wrong! Okay, you’re wrong.  Ah, I don’t know, you tell me. Anything you ah, wanna tell me, because, if you ah, you should, if you, you would, tell me.  You tell me! Maybe, it’s because I was just fooling with my ex! Oh no-no-no-no, no-no-no-no, that was you!!  All right!  Joey told me, he saw you two kissing.  No! In his office! How many kisses were there?  Wh-wh-why, wh-why, why, why was there kissing!? There should be no kissing!!  Yeah.  What?  All right.  I talked to Janice.  She doesn’t know. Says she loves us both. Y\\'know I woke up this morning and I was in love, well I was happy. Y\\'know it serves me right for buying that twelve pack of condoms. And now I can’t even return them, because she choked on the reciept!  I don’t know, y\\'know. What, what, would you do?  Come on, tell me.  Janice, I have something I need to tell you, and I want you to let me get through it, because it’s, it’s, it’s not gonna be easy.  I think you should go back with Gary. I don’t wanna be the guy that breaks up a family, y\\'know when my parents split up, it was because of that guy. Whenever I would see him I was always think y\\'know ‘You’re the reason, you are the reason why their not together.’ and I hated that guy. And it didn’t matter how nice he was, or how happy he made my Dad.  Yeah, well. It’s the right thing to do.  Then don’t leave me!  Forget what I said, I was babbling! Pick me!  No you don’t! No, no, no, I say you have to give your divorce another chance.  Ohhh. Don’t go.  No. No! No! No!  You can’t leave! I have your shoe!  I know.  I’ve found.  Yeah. We don\\'t feel like we can host Thanksgiving this year.  Well, it\\'s just with uhm, work and the stress of adoption, we just don\\'t feel like we have the energy. Plus, we don\\'t think it\\'s fair that every year the burden falls on us.  No, no! We made this decision together.  Don\\'t let yourself get manipulated this way!  We are supposed to make these decisions together! Did you not watch the Doctor Phil I taped for you?  Why come all the way from Kansas to do that?  You know what just occurred to me? This could be our last Thanksgiving just the two of us. I mean, we could be getting a baby soon!  Somebody is gonna pick us.  You know, you always cook this meal all by yourself. Let me help this year.  I\\'m serious, let me do something, just not the turkey or the stuffing, nothing \"high profile\".  Tell me more.  You obviously haven\\'t tasted my Palmolive potatoes!  Oh my God!  Hmm, the game\\'s at one.  Dinner is at four, we\\'ll never gonna make it back.  You say that now, but it could take us a long time to get back home. Plus Joey could get lost and and they could have to page us to go pick him up.  Look, Monica has been working hard all day, she didn\\'t wanna host this thing in the first place, we shouldn\\'t go!  I can\\'t believe they are not here! I slave and I slave for what? They\\'ve ruined cranberry day!  HA-HA! All you got was Monica\\'s stinky Brussels sprouts!  Please let me stay on this side of the door.  The cranberries...?  The floating heads do make a good point.  Well, you manheads aren\\'t any better. You lied about going to the game. You knew it would make you late, and you still went anyway.  That would be a lot more convincing if you weren\\'t drooling.  A little late for that.  Uhm, we\\'ve got turkey grease.  Can you ever feel your ears?  Okay, look, I\\'m gonna pull on the door and you guys push as hard as you can. Maybe we can get enough room to wiggle him out, okay? Okay, so PUSH!  Come on guys, PUSH!  My cranberries!  Argh! I can\\'t believe what you did. Monica\\'s gonna kill you!  What\\'s going on?  And?  That is the exact same thing.  This is unbelievable. It’s been like a half an hour. If this was a cartoon, you’d be looking like a ham right about now.  It’s Phoebe! Hi!  Wait, wait! Wh-what are you doing here?  Can we start over?  All right, now look at her and tell me she doesn’t look exactly like her sister.  They’re twins!  You know that thing, when you and I talk to each other about things?  Let’s not do that any more.  Your sister Ursula.  Yeah, yeah, she works over at that place, uh...  Oh, you do? Because she said you guys haven’t talked in like years.  Oh, and I’ve got Earth Science, but I\\'ll catch you in Gym.  Oh, okay. Send her in.  Hi, Nina. Come on in.  Uh, Yes. Yes. I’ve just been going over your data here, and little thing, you’ve been post-dating your Friday numbers.  Well, it throws my WENUS out of whack.  It’s not just that she’s cute, okay. It’s just that... she’s really really cute.  Hey, where you been?  Score.  Mr. D, how’s it going, sir?  And?  So what does this mean?  Hey, listen, I know I came in late last week, but I slept funny, and my hair was very very &ndash;  Well, you still haven’t taken down the Christmas lights.  I’m just trying to find the right moment, you know?  You know, once you’re inside, you don’t have to knock any more.  Wow, this is serious. I’ve never known you to pay money for any kind of capade.  Knit, good woman, knit, knit!  And that’s the Chrysler Building right there.  Yes, yes she is. Didn’t I memo you on this? See, after I let her go, err, I got a call from her psychiatrist, Dr. Flanen-nen, Dr. Flanen, Dr. Flan.  And err, he informed me that uh, she took the news rather badly, in fact, he uh, mentioned the word frenzy.  And yet, believable. So I decided not to fire her again until I can be assured that she will be no threat to herself, or others.  Well, I guess that’s why they call it psychology, sir.  You know, Ross, some scientists are now saying that, that monkeys and babies are actually different.  Ah, sure, Nina. What’s up?  Oh, well, ah... maybe that’s because they’re ah... jealous, of us.  Ah, well, maybe that’s, ah, because you’re getting a big raise.  Sure, why not?  Well, I ended up telling her everything.  You’re not gonna lose him.  Hey.  No way!  Oh my God! Who’s gonna watch that?!  So um, after you put the suggestion in the box, how long did it take for the roller skating thing to happen.  Okay, so I guess that’s about ah, two weeks before the topless thing kicks in.  Hey!  Fowl? No. Women? Nooo.  Easy Lenny.  Hey.  She?  Excuse me?  I stayed home from work today while you were at rehearsal so somebody could be here with our chick!  You don’t think I get up when you get up?  Yes, here it comes! I’m stuck here all day, and then you come in and spend two seconds with us and then expect to go off gallivanting with your friends? Well I don’t think so mister!  And you don’t think taking care of our chick is work?  I’ll take her back tomorrow.  Hey!  I know. See, yes. That’s Yasmine Bleeth, she’s a completely different kind of chick. I love you both. But in very different ways.  Hey!  I did! But the store wouldn’t take her back! So then I took her to the shelter, and you know what I found out?  If they can’t find a home for her, they kill her! And I’m not gonna let that happen to little Yasmine!  Okay. And it’s not just chicks y\\'know? It’s all kinds of other animals!  Thanks, I’m glad you see it that way.  Ohhh-hoo, funny story!  Okay! Now you stay out here, and you think about what you did!!  Having a swim.  Chicks don’t swim.  I don’t know. Should we try it?  I’m never gonna find a roommate, ever.  Well let’s see, there was the guy with the ferrets, that’s plural. The spitter. Oh-ho, and yes, the guy that enjoyed my name so much he felt the need to make a little noise every time he said it. Nice to meet you, Chandler Bing Bing! Great apartment Chandler Bing, Bing!  Two. This photographer, who seemed really dull. And this actor guy, who I’m not sure about, because when he called and I answered the phone ‘Chandler Bing,’ he said ‘Whoa-whoa, short message.’  Umm, how’s it going with you guys?  Soo, ah, Eric, what kind of photography do ya do?  Yes, that is cool. Because I have models here y\\'know......never.  Sure. Ummm. What’s up?  What gay thing?  Well okay Jerry, thanks for stopping by.  Hey, Mon.  Do I ever.  No way!  Just coffee! Where are we gonna hang out now?  You betcha!  Um-mm, yeah right!  Oh yes, and that’s what I want a roommate that I can walk around with and be referred to as the funny one.  Okay, but after that, we’re shootin’ some pool.  Excuse, I seem to have dropped my ball.  Oh, don’t thank me, thank the jerk that never showed up. Okay, I gotta get to get to work.  So ah, whatcha watching?  What’s it about?  Wow! Look at them run.  Yeah, I’ll go get one.  Well, hello!  Do you have any beers? We’re out of beers.  You okay?  Right.  Noo!! You don’t have a boyfriend because....I don’t, I don’t know why you don’t have a boyfriend. You should have a boyfriend.  Umm, this is nice.  No, I mean it, this feels really good. Is it a hundred percent cotton?  Anyway, I should go, one of the lifeguards was just about to dismantle a nuclear device.  I can’t believe you came back.  I found a dried up seashores.  All right, there’s a nuclear holocaust, I’m the last man on Earth. Would you go out with me?  I’ve got canned goods.  Excellent hole, Joe.  Well, can we help?! You want us to take you back to the house?!  We’ve got to do something!  Y\\'know what, he’s right. There’s something like uh, ammonia in that, that like kills the pain.  Me too!!  Oh my God! If you say that one more time, I’m gonna break up with you!  Look, Ross, you have what you want, you’re back with Rachel. If you bring this up now you’re gonna wreck the best thing that even happened to you.  I’ll give you a thousand dollars to talk to us.  And then Joey remembered something.  I KNEW IT!!!!  We were playing Gin? Y\\'know if we were a couple, we could play this game naked.  Okay. All right.  Sydney Portier? Hehheh.  Oh! That’s great, they haven’t seen the place since I moved in!  Why haven’t you told them?!  Why haven’t you told them?! Wouldn’t they be happy?!  Why wouldn’t they be happy?  What? What? Why?!  Is this why they don’t like me or why you don’t like me?  Y’know, it’ll be okay. It’ll be okay. Because when they come over, I will be all charming, I will make them fall in love with me, and then we’ll tell ‘em.  Hey, I can be pretty charming, babe, I won YOU over, didn’t I?  Well Monica just told me that they don’t.  This is great, another Thanksgiving with nothing to give thanks for.  Maybe I could give thanks by taking my Playstation over to my new apartment.  Hey.  Mr. and Mrs. Geller, you look wonderful, it is great to have you hear, let us take off your coats!  Whoa, snowing out there?  Yeah, Ross sure is a great guy, y’know I’ve always felt that how a young man turns out is a reflection on his father.  You do? Why?  What?! Why did you do that?  How could it not matter?!  What about all that “friends forever” stuff?  Your parents caught Ross smoking pot in college and he blamed it on me!  The reason we haven’t told them we’re together is because they hate me, okay? So will you fix this?  Yeah, I’m not gonna pay for those acting classes anymore.  Thank you!  We wanted to kiss at midnight, but nobody else is going to so y\\'know…  Do you want us to leave the room, or?  That\\'s good one too, Pheebs. Now all you have to do is find a planeload of people who\\'s resolution is to plummet to their deaths.  Nice!  Horn-swoggle.  What an interesting approach to guitar instruction. Y\\'know some might find it amusing, I myself find it regular.  Oh my God!  You know me sir. Oh ah, I do have a question for ya. Do you know how I get around the office computer network so I can access the really good Internet porn?  What’s funny about that?  Hey that’s okay. So, where do you want to go?  The Hard Rock Caf�?  Again?!  Yeah, he thinks that’s my name.  Oh it’s been going on way to long now. Y’know, I mean the first time he said it we were just passing each other in the hallway, so I didn’t say anything. And then the next time he said, \"Hey Toby, do you want a donut?\" And I-I wanted a donut. And now it’s five years later, the donut’s gone and I’m still Toby.  Shh! It is a family name!  Hey Bob.  If I see him, I’ll ask.  Yeah!  We’re on a semi-first name basis.  Bob? Ooh, working here with us? Everyday? Yeah, I don’t know if he has what it takes.  But this is eleven. It’s almost twice as hard up here.  I think it’s best sir.  Y’know what you should do, just toss ‘em in the shedder and claim you never got ‘em.  What does a guy have to do to be taken seriously around here?!  Sure, what’s up?  Hey Bobby.  Okay Bob listen uhh, I’m the reason you didn’t get the job up here.  Bob!  Well that puts me in a difficult position.  Hey!  Oh, what’s the matter?  Yeah?  What?!  Just out of curiosity did she tell you how you’re gonna go?  Oh hi!  Why don’t you open with a joke?  Wait a minute, hold the phone! You’re not talking about Chuckles University?!  That’s the way I did it ‘til I was 19.  Hey.  Yes, you got something from the Screen Actor’s Guild.  Okay, it’s not a check. They’re saying your health insurance expired because, you didn’t work enough last year.  All right.  Okay, make sure you look both ways before you cross the street.  Hey!  That’s great, but shouldn’t you be on the toilet right now?  What’s wrong with you?  This sounds like a hernia. You have to—you-you go to the doctor!  That’s a hernia.  I will loan you the money. Just go to the hospital and let’s just get that thing…pushed back in.  Hey.  Oh Joey’s got a really bad hernia, but that’s nothing a little laser eye surgery won’t fix!  Listen, I’m really glad you got the part.  But are you sure you can do this?  Now, is that never talking about it again?!  What are you doing?  Oh, all right.  Yeah, baby!  Making chocolate milk. Do you want some?  Well, she spent the last six months getting over him, and now she’s celebrating that by going on a date with him.  Oh, hey.  Right, right. Sometimes you guys just burst into flames.  Okay Ross, why don’t you come with me?  Robert’s coming out.  No. He.....he’s coming out of his shorts.  The man is showing brain.  What do we do? What do we do?  Like an eclipse.  Your liking it, huh?  No, actually Laurie’s a boy.  Hey.  You mean a three pointer?  I’m sorry, I’m sorry, it just seems that Robert isn’t as concealed in the shorts area, as ah, one may have hoped.  Stretchy pants! Why, those are the greatest things in the world! If I were you I would wear them every day, every day!  Hmmm, that’s very cool.  I can’t believe she cracked your code!  No, Beth doesn’t die, she doesn’t die. Does she Rachel?  We can’t tell him, you can’t go up to a guy you barely know and talk about his.... stuff.  Yeah, we got, um-hmm.  That\\'s right.  Oh no.  Okay.  Hey! You okay?  Did he just say, he loves Fonzie?  All right…  Yeah, that\\'s when if you get the babies out by the end of the month, they give you 2% financing.  Really? Male nurses?  So they\\'re going on dates? When?  This-this Fonzie person you keep referring too, is that uh, is that another doctor?  All right.  Oh, is this about you-you dating the nurse? Yeah, Joey already told me, and I am so-so fine. I mean, you and I we\\'re just, y\\'know, we\\'re nothing, we\\'re goofin\\' around.  Fine! Maybe I will too!  So Dan, nurse not a doctor huh? Kinda girlie isn\\'t it?  Oh.  All right. Very good.  Bye, momi-moo.  Yes!  Oh God, kindergarten flashback.  Okay, keep saying it!  So, are you really gonna go out with that nurse man?  Y\\'know, I don\\'t know if you\\'ve ever looked up the term goofing around in the dictionary… Well, I have, and the technical definition is, two friends who care a lot about each other and have amazing sex and just wanna spend more time together. But if you have this new fangled dictionary that gets you made at me, then we have to, y\\'know, get you my original dictionary. I am so bad at this.  Really? Okay, so…  Y\\'know, I sensed that I should stop. So we\\'re okay?  Right!  So uh, now that little Chandler turned out to be a girl, what are they gonna name her?  That\\'s kind of a masculine name, don\\'t you think?  Are you kidding me?! Joey. Joey! Joey! Joey! Joey! Joey! Joey! Joey! Joey! Joey!!  Oh. Oh, did-did-did I wake you?  Well, I am drinking lots of cups of coffee because I’m exhausted! Because Joey started snoring!  It’s not something to be proud of, okay? You have to go to a sleep clinic!  They don’t have those.  Next time you snore, I’m rolling ya over!  Hey, all right!  Y’know, whipped! Wah-pah!  That’s what I did. Wah-pah!  It’s 6:00.  Hey, I hear that you and Joshua are going out to dinner with Ross and Emily, and I think that’s, I think that’s really cool.  What?  Yeah, well, I don’t dance at weddings.  Hey!  Nothing.  Hi.  You mind if I…  So uh, what are you in for?  What a coincidence, I listen in my sleep.  Because I’m cooler.  Well she’s, she’s the kinda girl—Joey was unconscious.  Plus, you look cool.  I didn\\'t nail the boxes to the floor.  Yes, and while I\\'m doing that, Ross has a great computer story for you.  So, uh, wh-where ya from?  Unbelievable  Hey, look at all the boxes!  All right, think about it. Now remember when you were going out with that girl Donna and you guys broke up. Remember how horrible it was when you guys bumped into each other at the supermarket?  Now imagine you live at the supermarket.  No-no  Yeah, not bad right? You know what, Monica’s gonna be working late, so I\\'m gonna make this place spotless. You know what else I\\'m gonna do, know what else I\\'m gonna do? I\\'m gonna go downstairs, I\\'m gonna get her some flowers. Now who wouldn\\'t wanna live with me?  Yeah, now how\\'s that going though? Are you okay with the not-flirting thing?  What does it look like I\\'m doing? I am cleaning!  Authorization? I don\\'t need that. I\\'m gonna put everything back.  She\\'s not gonna care if I put her stuff back in the same stupid place.  She is gonna recognize that I did a nice thing and-and, appreciate it.  I see, I see, y-y-you\\'re trying to freak me out.  Hey Mon, how\\'s it going?  Oh come on, come on, it can\\'t be that bad.  No! No-no-no-no-no-no. It sounds like they really need you down there.  OK well here, we\\'ll just move the coffee table closer to the couch.  Yes, but the coffee table doesn\\'t match the...blahebdmsdlkhdyslkd;btyds...Rooosss!!!!  Oh no, yes we do my man. Remember when we were back in college and we went to that spring dance and you walked right up to that girl you liked and you could not stop talking about the Irish potato famine?  Yeah, Monica doesn\\'t like that either, Maybe I should stop doing that.  That\\'s not specific to girls.  And they don\\'t like it when you explain why your jokes are funny.  Man, I\\'m so lucky I have Monica.  Okay, is this lamp in the same place?  Look, uh, just come later, we\\'ll get everything squared away and you can come back later.  Bye! Thank God  Look, we have no time okay? We must focus. We gotta get everything back into its original place.  Uh-huh  Okay look, don\\'t...don\\'t be mad okay? But after I unpacked the boxes I wanted to do something nice for you, so, I-I-I cleaned the apartment. So I moved everything around and then I forgot where it, where it went back and I\\'m sorry, I\\'m very sorry, I\\'m sorry, I\\'m sorry.  Do you want me to be afraid of you?  Really?  Oh well you\\'re the best. You come here to me.  Ba dum bumb cheshhh!  No-no-no-no, we\\'re done.  Ok, you\\'re going to have to stop that, forever!  You think?  Ok, so it\\'s just because it was my table, I have to buy a new one?  What rule? There\\'s no rule, if anything, you owe me a table!  Well, I believe the piece of furniture was fine until your little breakfast adventure with Angela Delvecchio  Well, let\\'s just say the impressions you made in the butter left little to the imagination.  What do you mean, like, buy it together?  You think we\\'re ready for something like that?  Well, it\\'s a pretty big commitment, I mean, what if one of us wants to move out?  I\\'m not moving out.  Yeah, yeah, it\\'s just that with my last roommate Kip...  It\\'s just that we bought a hibachi together, and then he ran off and got married, and things got pretty ugly.  Aw, don\\'t do that  More coffee over here, please!  So what are you gonna do?  Oh, yeah, you have to tell her.  That\\'s patio furniture!  You pick one.  Oh, so, forget about the birds, but big red insects suggest fine dining!  So, what do you think?  I know!  What are you still doing here? She just broke up with the guy, it\\'s time for you to swoop in!  Wha-  Hey!  Yeah, get out!  Y’know when we move in together, can I get a gumball machine?  No. When it comes to sweets, he’s surprisingly strict.  No, no, I keep trying, y’know? I can get out, \"Joey, I have too…\" but then I lose my nerve and I always finish with, \"…go to the bathroom.\" He may think I’m sick.  Oh, so that’s this is gonna work now? You’re just gonna order me around all the time?  All right.  Look, I-I’m just gonna be right across the hall and I promise you, the minute Monica and I break up I’m moving right back in with you!  Okay, so that’s it, everybody knows! It’s official, we’re moving in together. No turning back. Are ya scared? Are ya?  Wow that was my scariest voice! You’re very brave.  Hey.  Well, I-I still think you’re very-very nice and very pretty…  Rach…  Okay, when are we gonna tell Rachel what is actually gonna happen?  Well, Joey’s my best friend.  You just said… Of course you’re my best friend. Would you please tell Rachel though?  Hey-hey!  I am now!  Look, I’m just gonna be across the hall, we can still do all the same stuff.  Not once did we do that.  Hey!  Oh yeah? Well, how’d she take it?  And you’re upset because you didn’t make your best friend cry?  Okay, I gotta ask, who calls us that?!  Honey, I got us that room at the Woodford Inn this weekend.  Gee if only she were one and had no idea what the hell a birthday was!  There\\'s this thing I really want us to do. I read about it in Maxim...  Fine, but if we end up not doing this Maxim thing because of this party...  Hey hey! Where\\'s the birthday girl?  Oh, sure, she was probably up all night, excited about the party she knows is happening.  I know, what are we gonna do?  I\\'m not going to Vermont with this Monica!  To be fair this one does have nuts.  Hi Emma! It\\'s the year 2020. Are you still enjoying your nap?  Was that Emma? Is she up?  I don\\'t know! You\\'ll tell us on Monday!  To the bathroom!  You do know, I can just turn them the other way around, right?  I\\'m begging you stop.  Thats a bear.  Ok, on your mark... Get set... GO!!!  I bought you. How did I forget that that\\'s all you do?  They left.  I\\'m sorry, is this a game for Emma or for Monica?  Emma, you even know it\\'s your birthday today? You\\'re one! One-year-old, that\\'s little.  Ooh! That\\'s my girl!  Did I teach her that? Did I just... impart wisdom?  Me too...  There\\'s no-one around. Why don\\'t we just take this one?  I was kidding.  No, not yet.  Hey, guys! Come on! You gotta see what Emma just did.  Let\\'s do it, come on!  Oh my God! Oh my God!  Well, before we answer that, I think we should address the more important question. How dumb are you?  He’s right. Nobody’s gonna benefit, and you’re just gonna hurt her.  All right look, if you absolutely have to tell her, at least wait until the timing’s right. And that’s what deathbeds are for.  Okay, okay-okay, ah, Chloe works with that guy Issac. Issac’s sister is Jasmine. And Jasmine works at that message place with Phoebe. And Phoebe’s friends with Rachel. And that’s the trail, I did it!  Off?!!  Yeah, well I don’t think you can make that statement, unless you’ve been kicked in an area that God only meant to be treated nicely.  Oh, that’s mature.  Nothing, nothing.  Yeah, well, I guess they had a fight, and he got drunk....  Uh-oh.  She was not good. Not good.  Uh-oh.  Yeah, never cheat on Rachel.  Y\\'know what, I think we can go out there. I mean they have more important things to worry about.  Oh great, food with hair on it.  Because that would be crazy?  Yeah, come on, it’s Ross and Rachel, they’ve got too.  What?  Are you actually saying these words?  Let’s go.  Yeah, well sure, when he did it, it was funny. When I did it to my boss\\'s hat. . . all of the sudden I have this big attitude problem.  Rhythm?  You know I think he will be surprised, \\'till he realizes he\\'s a monkey, and uh, you know, isn\\'t capable of that emotion.  Hello.  The one time they\\'re not home.  That\\'s how radio stars escape stalkers.  Well, you remember Cathy Bates in Misery?  Well, she looks the exact opposite of that.  Oh no no no, she\\'s a total wack job. Yeah, she thinks that Joey is actually Dr. Drake Remore.  Hey, just because this woman thinks she can actually see Joey through the magical box in her living room doesn\\'t mean she\\'s not a person. I mean, does she not deserve happiness, does she not deserve love? What\\'re you lookin\\' at me for? He\\'s the one who wants to boff the maniac.  Very informative!  That\\'s what I did when I lost my Clydesdales.  What, you never look down in the shower? Oh please. I\\'m not allowed to make one joke in the monkey-is-penis genre?  Ahhhh.  Uh, yes, yes it is.  Do you know me or are you just really good at this game?  Susie Moss, right, yeah, wow, you look. . . great job growing up.  Oh, right, well yeah, I graduated fourth grade and realized I wasn\\'t a pimp.  Yes, back then I, uh, used humor as a defense mechanism. Thank God I don\\'t do that anymore.  No, Stephen Hurs was the kid who would eat anything for money, David Stein was the guy who had no elbows.  OK that\\'s not what he was doing. Alright, he was looking for his bus money.  Oh uh, o, OK.  Well, uh, let\\'s try one more. . . there you go, say Ernie\\'s, 8 o\\'clock.  No one was around to hear that?  Hey, stick a fork in me, I am done.  Like, when you\\'re cooking a steak.  Well then, how do you know when vegetables are done?  OK, then, eat me, I\\'m done.  I\\'ve met the perfect woman. OK, we\\'re sitting on her couch, we\\'re fooling around, and then suddenly she turns to me and says, \\'Do you ever want to do it in an elevator?\\'  Ahh, I believe my exact words were, \\'Flaign,en - sten\\'. I mean I didn\\'t know what to say, how do you know if you wanna do it on an elevator?  Oh no no no no, no no no no no no, you see, what I had planned shouldn\\'t take more that 2, 3 minutes tops.  Well, ye, yes, actually, but, uh, they were my Aunt Edna\\'s, and there were three of us in there.  You want me to wear your panties?  Well, if I was wearing your underwear then, uh, what would you be wearing?. . . You\\'re swell.  I\\'m hangin in. . . and a little out.  Because I went to an all boys high school and God is making up for it.  I can\\'t believe we\\'re doing this.  What?  Oh.  OK, but uh, I hope you realize this means we\\'re gonna miss hearing about the specials.  Hey, do you want this done quick, or do you want this done right?  OK.  Well, you want me to uh, clench anything, or-... Susie? Susie.  Huh? Where, whaddya mean?  What, what\\'s what you mean?  That was in the fourth grade. How could you still be upset about that?  Alright, I hope you realize you\\'re not getting these underpants back.  Joey?  Joey!  Oh, no no no, she took off with my clothes.  Not exactly. . . I\\'m wearin panties.  No, no, this is the first time.  I was not trying them out, Susie asked me to wear them.  No. I\\'m not letting you or anybody else see, ever.  No, no, you don\\'t have to see.  Alright, one of you give me your underpants.  How can you not be wearing any underwear?  Alright look Ross I\\'ll give you 50 dollars for your underpants.  Hey Phoebs, can I have the milk after you?  How long you been waitin\\' to say that?  Six-hour trip to London. That’s a lot of Monica.  You got your passport?  There it is.  Okay, ‘cause that’s not gonna get annoying.  Hey, y’know what? I was wrong.  I am, I’m ignoring you.  Oh, what the hell is that?  Okay, if you see a little version of me in there? Kill it!  Okay. Listen-listen, we’re not gonna have to walk this way the entire time are we?  I think it’s great. It’s great. Y’know, they’re thinking of changing the name of this place.  To Put the Camera Away!!!  Well, I don’t have to buy that, \"I’m with stupid\" T-shirt anymore.  All right, look, you’re not really gonna buy that are you? Don’t you think you’ve embarrassed me enough for one day?  How can I answer that when I’m pretending I don’t know you?  Oh really? Then how come no one here is wearing them?  All right, look, if you insist on wearing that, in public, y’know, you’re gonna spend the rest of the afternoon all by yourself.  No-no-no, y’know what? I really shouldn’t have said that you were embarrassing me, I mean that really wasn’t cool. And if it makes you feel any better, I’ve had a really lousy day.  Yeah?  That’s… That’s was…  How did you? How? How?  I’m gonna go to the bathroom.  That was pretty intense huh?  Joey, it’s been three days, okay.. Your just a little homesick, Okay. Would you just try to relax. Just, just try to enjoy yourself.  Out loud?  So how are you doing?  The guy was hammered, okay? There’s no way, you look like Ross’s mother.  Because he’s crazy. Okay? He came up to me earlier and thanked me for my very moving performance in Titanic.  Ahh, you know what? That is....Who wouldn’t want you?  Yeah you are!!  Well I’ve-I’ve never done that with you before.  So, ahh, how are ya? How ya...How ya... You okay?  Oh yea yea, absolutely.  I don’t want to look.  Hey.  What?  Oh my god!  Oh yea, your right. It’s the second one.  What we did last night was....  I’m coming over tonight though, right?  Okay, our news. My company has asked me to head up our office in Tulsa , so as of Monday I\\'m being officially relocated.  They said it could be up to a year.  There is nothing like the support of your loving wife, huh?  I\\'m sorry buddy, but I don\\'t think I\\'m gonna be able to make it.  Really?  I\\'ve got good news!  Okay, I have news. You don\\'t have to move to Tulsa. You can stay here and keep your job.  I\\'m sorry, are you just used to saying that?  Really?  That\\'s fast math! We could use you in Tulsa.  Hey, you said that without gagging!  I know what she\\'s talking about.  He saw a therapist?  Hey!  Looking for restaurant jobs for you in Tulsa.  Slim Pickings.  No, \\'Slim Pickings\\', it\\'s a barbecue restaurant. They\\'re looking for a cook. Actually \\'cook\\' may be a bit of a stretch. They\\'re looking for someone to shovel mesquite.  \\'So Cheesy\\' also has an opening.  Can I just say how much I appreciate you coming with me. When we get to Tulsa I\\'m taking you for a great dinner at \\'Slim Pickings\\'. \\'So Cheesy\\'? \\'Whole Hog\\'? It\\'s going to be tough to keep Kosher in Tulsa.  Honey, we\\'re leaving tomorrow you\\'ve still got a lot of packing to do.  What?  How far outside?  What happened to \\'you can\\'t live without me four days a week\\'?  I think you should take the job.  Yeah. I know it must be important to you when you start chattering like a monkey.  Diagnostician or boo-boo fixer?  Does he say that before he sticks his thermometer in your touchy?  That was not a security blanket! That was a wall-hanging!  Of course I will call you. I love you.  Any chance you are trying to pick a fight to make all this easier?  Well, bye Mon, bye Ross, Rachel, bye Emma!  I know.  Couldn’t sleep last night you know, then I started worrying about this big divisional meeting that I have later today, the more I worried about it the more I couldn’t sleep.  Y’know? I was like, if I fall asleep now I’ll get six hours sleep, but if I fall asleep now I’ll get five hours sleep. Not matter what I did I couldn’t fall asleep.  Hey, what do I know? I wanted to get a bigger gorilla.  Yep.  Monica can I talk to you outside for a minute?  Actually Pheebs its more of a husband and wife kinda thing  Umm, you know how we always said that it would be fun to move to Paris for a year? You know, you could study French cooking and I could write and we could take a picnic along the Seine and go wine tasting in Bordeaux?  Okay, you know how that people say that Tulsa is the Paris of Oklahoma?  People who’ve never ever been to Paris.  Okay, Ms. McKenna, she kind of works above my boss, she asked me to move to Tulsa and be the president of our office there, and I was sleeping and apparently, said yes.  The Sooner State, whatever that is.  Really? Oh What A Beautiful Morning!  Surrey With A Fringe On Top.  Oh so there can’t be any yelling.  We’re moving to Tulsa  Hey! Ready to go?  What are you doin\\'?  Great, a faster way to tell people that I\\'m unemployed and childless .  The tall girl who wouldn\\'t sleep with you?  Bet she\\'d sleep with you now...  Oh, I\\'m so sorry!  You\\'re not gonna need my help?  I believe I read that somewhere!  I respectfully disagree.  Who cares? Nobody reads those things  I don\\'t have a page.  Because I told everyone he slept with dinosaurs.  Would you get that please? People have been calling to congratulate me all day.  Oh, you\\'ll see my friend.  Well, how you died was funny.  It kills over one americans every year.  You wanna talk about people\\'s feelings? You should have heard how hurt professor Stern was yesterday when I told him I wouldn\\'t be able to go with him to Key West!  Huh! So that\\'s what I would look like if I worked out... and was being serviced by a policeman. You\\'re not actually going to send these out are ya?  No, come on, you know that\\'s not true.  Well, the gay community is a lot more vocal than the dead community.  Alright look, let\\'s think about this, ok, do you really think that people are gonna stir up your family at this tragic time? That people are gonna post condolences on a website? This is not about people not caring that you\\'re dead .This is about people not having a decent outlet for their grief.  Right, I mean, come on, I\\'m sure that if you had a funeral or a memorial service, tons of people would come.  Ross, don\\'t press send, don\\'t press se... !  There you go! Someone came!  Oh yes, yes... let me... take your coat.  Some guy, Tom Gordon.  Please, one ridiculous problem at a time!  You gave them one day\\'s notice, not everyone in our class checks the web site everyday and Monica... it\\'s probably the way you stand!  Oh, that\\'s not true. You had an impact on me, I mean, it\\'s 15 years later and we\\'re still best friends. Doesn\\'t that count for something?  Kori? Kori Weston?  Wow! You look amazing!  Chandler, Chandler Bing. I\\'m not gay, I\\'m not gay at all.  I didn\\'t know Ross and you were so close.  I\\'m sure that would mean a lot to him. And if heaven has a door, I\\'m sure he\\'s pressing his ear up against it and listening intently.  Oh, yeah, right, OK... inlcuding the waffles last week, you now owe me... 17 jillion dollars.  Then put out fire by peeing, no get invited back.  Crazy bitch.  Hey!  Uh, let\\'s see... Alvin... Simon... Theodore.... no.  Forget about her.  Course there, they just call it food.  I\\'m still on my first. I just think you\\'re nice.  Yes, the doctors say if they remove it, he\\'ll die.  Oh, that\\'s Ross\\'s.  Come on, Ross? Remember back in college, when he fell in love with Carol and bought her that ridiculously expensive crystal duck?  No it\\'s not. It\\'s small. It\\'s tiny. It\\'s petite. It\\'s wee.  OK, is there a mute button on this woman?  What about the time difference?  Well then maybe you shouldn\\'t go.  Hey, big...  So how\\'d it go?  The fact that you\\'d even ask that question shows how little you know me.  Yes, I know, as it happens my room is very very close to the parade route.  I didn\\'t know you had another level.  Alright, you did it! Do we have any fruit?  Really? So, you\\'re gonna stick with this \\'it\\'s all for her\\' thing?  Hey.  Oh, it’s awkward. It’s awkward. It’s awkward.  You can be the best man when I get married.  Oh no-no-no, you—yeah, of course you get to be my best man.  I’m not even getting married! Okay, this is a question for science fiction writers!  I’m not even… I’m not even…  Yeah, well, good luck trying to top the last one.  Oh, I’m Ross. I’m Ross. I’m too good for the Hut; I’m too good for the Hut.  He just said, \"No strippers.\"  Central Perk?  Ugh. Just a sec, give me a minute to wake up for this—Ah-ha-ha!! You lost the ring! You’re the worst best man ever!  You slept with the stripper?  Hey!  So you might say, it’s a magic ring.  Well, I think it all started when you said, \"Hey Joey, why don’t you be my best man.\"  Well, what if we just ah, called her, used a fake name, and had her come to my office?  Way to be cool, man.  He will, Joe.  Hey, come on, it’s not your fault.  No, you should.  Really?  Thanks man.  What a baby.  You mean the spitter?  Easy for you to say; you’ll be wearing a veil.  You mean the guy who kept staring at your chest?  Sorry, I just don’t like the idea of when I say, \"I do,\" he’s thinking, \"Yeah, I’d do her too!\"  Yeah!  Guys thank you very much but neither of you is marrying us.  We are going to have a legitimate member of the clergy! And when I say legitimate I mean, gay and in control of his saliva!  No, but Horny for Monica Minister called, wanting to know if we were still together.  Joe…  Yeah you can do it.  Yeah.  Hey!  Hey!  Our minister…  Okay.  Yeah. O-okay.  See Joe, not that that’s not grrreat! But, one of the cool things about having somebody we know perform the ceremony is that it can be about us! Y’know, it can be more personal. You can tell stories about us!  See Joe, we want you to tell stories but y’know, romantic stories. Nice stories.  Joe?  Isn’t that what happened with you and the bride’s maid?  And I was a perfect gentleman and I walked her to her hotel room and said goodnight.  But then later that night…  Well, last time I saw him he was heading out the door with the bride’s maid and a bucket of strawberries. So uh, you’re not still upset about what that guy told ya are ya?  Well, look it’s been a really emotional time y’know, and you’ve had a lot to drink. And you’ve just got to let that go okay? I mean you were the most beautiful in the room tonight!  But we don’t do that.  How drunk are you?  What?  I know.  Okay!  It bodes well for me that speed impresses you.  Yep!  Count of three?  Two!  Well I think it’s safe to say that our friendship is effectively ruined.  Eh!  No! No! No!  Uh, could you leave me one?  Yeah.  No I-I-I’m fine.  What?  Who did you originally want to hook up with?  I don’t believe it. The most romantic night of my life and I’m runner up.  Okay, it’s just weird! Okay? I don’t want to be standing their saying my vows and then having the mental image of you and Monica! I-I-I need…I don’t know what I need. I need a walk.  Look Joe, I know you wanted to do the wedding…  How can I not be upset? Okay? I finally fall in love with this fantastic woman and it turns out that she wanted you first!  That’s what you should say.  When you’re marrying us; that’s what you should say.  I’d love it if you would do it.  But those are the words! Those exact words!  Yeah, we talked and Monica made me see that I over reacted a little bit and some things in life are more important.  Are you looking at naked tribe\\'s women?  That\\'s a pig.  What?!  How can he do that? Didn\\'t you sign a lease?  Oh, yeah! Absolutely! Anything you need man! But you have to promise me the second you are feeling better so that we can make fun of your hair!  He thought you said gonad.  Love what you\\'ve done with the place.  Oh yeah!  Oh, the tears are real.  What are you doing?  You built a fort didn\\'t ya?  I hate this thing!  Bye-bye little puppet Joey hand?  Okay.  No-no-no-no!  Okay, so he\\'s out of here.  Well, I-I-I\\'m done with this. You want anything Ross? Sports? International? Apartment listings?  Not even on page 7?  What about that circled one?  Yes, it is.  There we go!  Let\\'s go quicker.  Yeah, well look at this kitchen, slash bathroom. Well that\\'s great! Y\\'know so you can cook while in the tub.  Yeah, you don\\'t want to be stuck with us for the next five weeks.  It\\'s a kitchen slash bathroom.  We are bad people.  Yes that was a nice place!  Not a lot of closet space, but he can just hang his stuff out the window in a bag!  What are we gonna do?  About Ross!  Ohhhhh!  98. 99. 100. Okay, go!  Here we go! Here we go!  Hey!  You\\'re kidding, no!  Yeah!  Yes! Ross, you have to stay!  All right, buddy!  Well, I see you\\'ve had a very productive day. Don\\'t you think the cowboy hat is a little much?  Hey!  Y’know I’m-I’m really glad we decided not to sleep together before the wedding.  Y’know I was thinking if we had a…a big fight and uh we broke up for a few hours…  Technically we could have sex again. What do you think, bossy and domineering?!  That’s me! Come on!  Well get rid of her, obsessive and shrill.  I’ll be right with you.  Umm, so this Aunt Marilyn is-is-is-is she coming to the wedding?  Hey! Did you have the baby yet?  He’s not snoozing, he’s teaching a class.  I haven’t seen this dress.  You really want to take me?  So you’re never actually going to pay me back?  I always knew you were gonna make it. I’m so proud of you.  This is so exciting! It’s so glamorous! People taking our picture. How do I look?  What?  It’s just so glamorous.  Good job Joe! Well done! Top notch!  Oh-ho-ho, yeah!  The whole thing! Can we go?  I love the specifics, the specifics were the best part!  I was surprised to see a kangaroo in a World War I epic.  Where have you been?! I tried to call you! I want to talk to you! I still feel so bad!  I’m so sorry.  What?!  You don’t owe me anything, I don’t want you money…  I don’t know, five hundred dollars?  Well then there was the second set, the infamous booger head shots.  Do you want a calculator?  Well uh, there was acting classes, stage combat classes, tap classes…  Uh then there was that dialect coach who helped you with that play where you needed a southern accent. Which after twenty hours of lessons still came out Jamaican.  Yes, money well spent!  Okay, two, three years of rent, utilities, food…  Are there no conscious men in the city for you two?  Y\\'know, we don\\'t have to watch this. Weekend At Bernie\\'s is on Showtime, HBO, and Cinemax.  Exactly. Weekend At Bernie\\'s! Dead guy getting hit in the groin twenty, thirty times! No?  Yeah, well, you wouldn\\'t think it was cool if you\\'re eleven years old and all your friends are passing around page 79 of \\'Mistress Bitch.\\'  You can say that because she\\'s not your mom.  Shhh, busy beaming with pride.  Now why would she say that\\'s embarrassing?  THAT\\'S TOO MUCH INFORMATION!!  This is the way that I find out. Most moms use the phone.  ...And then he burst into flames.  Please God don\\'t let it be Kung Pow Chicken.  Well, I think you need to come out of your shell just a little.  I know I am.  Myyy mother, ladies and gentlemen.  What are you guys doing out here?  Oh my God.  I can\\'t believe it. Paolo kissed my mom?  What?  I spent the entire day with you, why didn\\'t you tell me?!  Y\\'know, of all my friends, no-one knows the crap I go through with my mom more than you.  I\\'m still mad at you for not telling me.  What was that?  Yes, well, I expect this from her. Okay? She\\'s always been a Freudian nightmare.  Because it\\'s complicated, it\\'s complex- Hey, you kissed my mom!  That\\'s very funny. We done now?  That would be no. Look, just because you played tonsil tennis with my mom doesn\\'t mean you know her. Alright? Trust me, you can\\'t talk to her.  No, just knowing you\\'re gonna be there is enough.  You kissed my best Ross! ...Or something to that effect.  Really stupid.  Yeah. No. No...  Yeah, okay.  Nice save.  Hey.  Awful. Awful. Couldn\\'ta gone worse.  Pretty good! I told her.  I know, just quick-quick question, quick question. Which one was Deep Impact and which one was Armageddon?  It got interesting! Damn you Oprah!  Hey, y’know what we can do? Y’know, now that we are up? We can just like talk to each other all night long, y’know like we did when we were first going out. It’d be fun!  Okay, so how bummed were you when the second sister died huh?  That’s correct.  Yeah! You?  Do you know what just happened?  No. We were in the middle of sex…and you fell asleep.  I was giving you some of my best moves, and you missed it. So please wake up so we can do it right!  Okay.  Well, you’re not gonna believe this, but if you have seven minutes…  Do you wanna?  Let me ask you, why is everybody using these tiny lights nowadays? I remember when people used to use big lights.  I dunno what it is, it just doesn’t quite feel like Christmas to me.  See now it feels like Christmas!  Hey Joe what’s up?  I can see why that’s hard to resist.  You are aware that she’s not a monkey, right?  What, what are you laughing at?  I don’t think so.  I can save you time ladies, I’m right here.  What? That’s terrible!  Oh well, that makes it not terrible.  No not okay, you can’t look for Monica’s presents!  No, you don’t have to, and you can’t because I live here too.  Why?  No, I have a great idea for a present for her.  If I help, we can find ‘em faster!  Y’know when you guys said you were gonna go across the hall and look, you don’t, you don’t do that every year do you?  You don’t, like go into the back of my closet, and look under my gym bag or anything?  I couldn\\'t find anything at Joey--Hey-hey, oh hey!  Those are my gifts, I got them for you.  Those are book ends! That\\'s a great gift!  Make sure you put all that stuff back in the closet, okay?  Oh, hey guys!  Yes, if the presents are hidden south for the winter.  Oh, the duck seems to think that Monica got me garbage! Hmm, I wonder what I could get Monica that’s as good as garbage?  What?  Oh great!  Okay! Okay! Okay!  Wait, we can’t do this.  I don’t wanna know what Monica got me. Y’know? I mean, look, I’m sure she worked really hard at getting you a present, and wanting to surprise me, and you guys are gonna ruin that, and I, look we have to put these back, this is not what Christmas is about.  Nobody is opening anything ok? Look, I don’t know about you guys, but I wanna see the look on Monica’s face when I give her my present, and I’m sure she wants to see the look on my face when I get mine. So please, please, can we just, can we put them back?  Fine!  That’s what you got me?  Now you do that, you’re on TV.  Hey!  Oh, we wanted to finish the crossword before we went to bed. Hey, do you know a six-letter word for red?  Hey!  Oh, y\\'know what? The last time Joey went to a meadow, his mother was shot by a hunter.  Okay, but impersonating a police officer is a serious thing. You could get arrested.  Hi, Joe.  Oh, come on! You\\'ve been acting strange all day!  No, it can mean anything. Like uh, all of the sudden you\\'re jealous because I\\'ve become the apartment stud.  Joey, look, are you attracted to Monica? Right here, right now, are you attracted to her?  Well there you have it!  Well y\\'know, Monica and I were friends before we started dating. So maybe-maybe that\\'s it?  Oh yeah, it\\'s actually in my bedroom.  Y\\'know, I would be offended, but Monica is freakishly strong, so…  Okay.  Yeah.  Okay, I don\\'t think we can turn anymore!  Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!!  Okay, yeah, I think it\\'s really stuck now.  Oh, y\\'know, what did you mean when you said pivot?  Ooh, I do! I do! I do!  No, I don’t want to tell anybody else because I don’t want Monica to find out.  Well, it’s because I trust you, you’re one of my best friends, and you walked in on me when I was looking at ring brochures.  Me too.  Hey.  Oh all right.  Oh well, we don’t because we got…the…other pl-place.  Y’know, I’m so glad I picked you to help me with this.  Uh-uh, yes. I would like to see that ring please.  Sir, can I ask you to umm, could you…hold out that ring and ask me to marry you?  Yes! Yes, but I can only pay $8,000.  No, did he hug you?!  Well, you can see my dad in Vegas kissing other dads.  Yeah?  I’m a little busy here Paul.  Do you have my credit card?  Oh, I can’t go.  Oh, that’s uh, that’s pretty nice but I’m gonna go with the one I picked first.  What?  They put you in jail?  Phoebe, I asked you to guard the ring!  Yeah but when he proposed to me with the ring I got goose bumps.  It was the ring!  I can’t believe I let you talk me into buying this stupid gumball machine looking ring!  I can’t do that.  Okay and he hasn’t proposed yet because she has no ring on her finger.  Yeah! Okay, go, go, go get him.  Yeah, she’s dying… Of a cough apparently.  Yep, pretty much.  I’m gonna ask Monica to marry me.  I know.  Check out the ring.  I just saw Janice.  Yeah, she was at Rockefeller Center skating with her husband, she looked so happy. I almost feel bad for whipping that kid’s pretzel at them.  Yes, but you ended up having sex with both of them that afternoon.  Oh, y\\'know what, I’m gonna be okay, you don’t have to throw a party for me.  Oh, well then, if anybody should have a party it should be him.  Okay, well he totally screwed up the punch line. Y\\'know, it’s supposed to be arrghh-eh og-errigh.  Hello-dillillio!!  Yeah, Jell-o just like Mom used to make.  Hi Joey’s sisters!  Oh, I’m taking my ex-girlfriend of my speed dialer.  Well, my apartment isn’t there anymore, because I drank it.  Yeah, I ended up in the storage room, and not alone.  Ow, no ‘woo-hooing,’ no ‘woo-hooing.’  I can’t remember which sister.  Okay! You don’t think I thought of that?  Veronica. Look, it’s got to be Veronica, the girl in the red skirt. I definitely stuck my tongue down her throat.  Look, when I’ve been drinking, sometimes I tend to get overly friendly, and I’m sorry.  Why can’t we talk in here? With, with, witnesses.  It’s gotta be the first one.  Yep, I’m in a tree.  Well, that’s the part where you tell him that I moved to France. When actually I’ll be in Cuba.  What if Mary-Angela comes to the door and I ask for Mary-Angela?  I’m here to see Mary-Angela.  Where’s Mary-Angela?  This teramisu is, is excellent. Did you make it Mary-Angela?  Well, it’s, it’s yummy. So Mary-Angela do you like it?  So um, Mary-Angela, what’s your second favorite?  Would you just please....give me the receipt ‘cause this is great. It’s top notch.  So will I.  Oh no-no-no I was just squinting. That doesn’t mean anything.  Ahhhh, you’re not Mary-Angela.  This is so bad. If-if you’re not Mary-Angela, then-then who is?  No Joey! No Joey! Don’t Joey! Joey!  Joey if you wanna punch me, go ahead, I deserve it. But I just want you to know that I would never soberly hurt you or your family, you’re my best friend. I would never do anything like this ever again.  Okay, absolutely!  Don’t worry.  Y’know, I can’t believe Kathy did this too me. I really, thought that she was the one. I tell you what, from now on I’m never getting out of this chair, ever! Okay? From now on, this chair is the one! You wanna what else is the one? My sweat pants!  That’s right! Where are the guys? I’m ready to get drunk and see some strippers.  They got a breakfast buffet.  Ooh, let me talk to him!  Well, can I just…  She’s shhing me! It’s my phone and she’s shhing me!  Ow!  Maybe, she doesn’t hit him all the time.  So y’know, uh, when’s he getting back?  Yes you can. You’re thinking about time, you can’t go back in time.  No thanks, Mom!  Ahh, come on! Y’know what—y’know what, I think I’m just gonna go home and call Kathy.  No! That was a test! In a couple of hours I’m gonna get really drunk and wanna call Kathy and you guys are gonna have to stop me! And then after that, I’m gonna get so drunk, I’m gonna wanna call Janice  Ohhh!!  Oh yeah, that was great. Thanks to you, the hottest cocktail waitress there is quitting to teach the third grade!  All right, well I’m gonna put my sweats back on.  Yeah?  Stripping!  Okay, look, I’m gonna have to ask you all to leave.  I am totally picturing you with all those women!  Well, I’m there too!  Stop it! You’re killing me! I think I just moved on to Phase Four!  Where I don’t want to have a relationship ever! I just want to have sex with strippers and my friends!!  Come on, let me see that smile.  Please?  I know, I know, but you’re gonna have plenty of chances. There are literally thousands of women out there just waiting to screw me over.  Oh, that’s fine! Go with your instincts, go with your instincts.  Come on! Would you please pay attention, I could wake up at any moment!  That\\'s sweet, Joey.  Are you aware that you\\'re still talking?  No-no-no! I am the king of bad Thanksgivings. You can\\'t just swoop in here with your bad marriage and take that away from me.  It\\'s a tradition, like the parade. If the parade decided it was gay, moved out, and abandoned its entire family.  Really? Worse than, \"More turkey Mr. Chandler?\"  It\\'s exactly like it sounds.  I\\'m over here big guy.  Oh, come on Monica, reliving past pain and getting depressed is what Thanksgiving is all about. Y\\'know, for me anyway. And of course, the Indians.  Well, as long as the pilgrims didn\\'t eat it, I\\'m in.  Oh yeah, it was great. You should be a chef.  Emotional Knapsack?  Right on! Oh! Uh, but, don’t take to long okay? \\'Cause uh, we\\'re gonna test out our fake ID\\'s tonight, right Clifford Alverez.  Dude, don\\'t do that too me!  No, it\\'s not that, I just don\\'t want to be stuck here all night with your fat sister.  I called you fat?! I don\\'t even remember that!  I am so sorry. I really am. I was an idiot back then. I rushed the stage at a Wham concert for crying out loud!  I am really sorry. That is so terrible. I am so, so sorry.  We wanna hear Monica\\'s Thanksgiving story!  Oh my God!  You just, you look so different! Terrific! That dress! That body!  Sorry!  Sorry.  Monica, I was wondering if you can make me some of that righteous mac and cheese like last year.  Okay.  Are you all right?  What?  Without my toe?! I need my toe!  That\\'s why I lost my toe?! Because I called you fat?!  That\\'s why for an entire year people called me Sir Limps-A-Lot?!  I can\\'t believe this.  Yeah, well, sorry doesn’t bring back the little piggy that cried all the way home! I hate this stupid day! And everything about it! I\\'ll see you later.  Oh-oh, I\\'m a duck! I go, \"Quack, quack!\" I’m happy all the time!  Nice try.  Look, Monica…  This is not going to work.  You are so great! I love you!  Nothing! I said, I said \"You\\'re so great\" and then I just, I just stopped talking!  No I didn\\'t!  No I didn\\'t!  No I don\\'t! Stop it! Stop it! Stop it! Stop it!  Relax! We\\'ll just get her some antacids.  Oh my God!  Next time, can I say breathe?  Where are you going?  You can\\'t leave me alone with her.  This is exactly the kind of social situation that I am not comfortable with!  It\\'s just that we\\'ve never spent any time, you know, alone together.  Okay.  So, ah... Any plans for the summer?  Hah. May not wanna mention this. So, you ever wonder which is worse, you know; going through labor or getting kicked in the nuts?  Well, it\\'s just interesting. You know, because no one will ever know, because no one can experience both.  One of life\\'s great, unanswerable questions. I mean, who knows? Maybe there\\'s something even more painful than those things? Like this.  Is it really that bad?  I\\'m okay.  Alright. Wow, that is one disgusting miracle.  Wow!  Well, that\\'s spongy.  I know. He has your eyes.  I mean, I know that\\'s not possible, but he does.  Okay.  How do you feel?  Oh, yeah! These are the faces of two people in the know!  Well, gosh. That makes me feel so special and good.  What do we do?  Uh-huh! Join me, won\\'t you?! Okay, what do you say we keep one, and then just like have an option on the other one?  Why not? We could give each of them half a medallion, and then years later, they\\'ll find each other and be reunited. I mean, that\\'s a great day for everybody.  What if they\\'re not? What if it\\'s adopted by a king?  Monica, we are not ready to have two babies!  Okay.  Okay!  Maybe. Unless they\\'re like two people who have lived in apartments next to each other for years, and then one day they\\'re pushed through a vagina and they meet.  Bye!  Have fun at church-camp!  I know! You ready to trade?  Okay.  We could trade later.  Hey.  Her name is Erica.  Yeah. It\\'s a shame you two didn\\'t get to spend more time together.  I love you.  I have no idea what\\'s going on, but I am excited!  We were wondering what was taking so long with the gift, but now we understand you were doing this.  Really? You got us a chick and a duck?  Oh, don\\'t worry, we\\'ll find them.  Alright.  It\\'s okay, it\\'s just an egg roll.  Okay, let\\'s find these birds.  Well, that can\\'t be good!  How?  Oh, tons, I\\'m quite the woodsman.  Joey, wait! The ball!  I don\\'t know. Maybe we can open this up somehow.  No... It\\'s all glued together.  I don\\'t know. Maybe.  I know! It\\'s.. It\\'s the foosball table.  Did that movie ever get made?  And we\\'re also gonna buy you tiny, bird hearing-aids.  What\\'s the matter?  I understand.  Well, I can\\'t do it either.  We have to bust it open, but neither of us can do it!  That was... Impressive.  Sorry about the table, man.  You gonna buy a new one?  Well, at least we got these little guys out.  Aww, we were worried about you! Hm. I guess I better get used to things crapping in my hand, huh?  Hey, you know what? Maybe we should keep them here with you.  Yeah, I mean we\\'ve got a lot going on right now. And, plus, here they\\'d have their own room.  You know, I - I think you\\'re set with the poultry.  I think there may be another reason. So, awkward hug or lame cool guy handshake?  Wow, this is weird.  Where\\'s Ross?  Oh, okay.  Oh, it\\'s gonna be okay.  Sure. Where?  Treeger’s snaking the shower drain.  Hey!  Do we pay for this?  Maybe we shouldn’t pay our phone bill—free phone sex.  Yeah, Joey just pressed something on the remote and it just, came on!  Like finding money with naked people on it!  We don’t know what could make this go away.  And no one touches the air around the TV!  We still have porn.  Or a job where you don’t have to carry a table.  It’s the theme from Good Will Humping.  Oh-oh, yeah, and did he also say that ah, some of the dialogue was corny and that he actually found it was funny and not sexy?  They don’t really talk to us about that kind of stuff. I can get you some free white out though.  Whoa-whoa, wait a minute, did you say, you love her?  All right look, forget it, forget it. You told her you love her, it’s over.  What?  Hi! Listen, can we watch cartoons on your television? We need a porn break. We spent the last two hours watching In & Out & In, Again.  Because then we would be the guys who turned off free porn.  Pregnant Woman Slays Four?  What’s the second part of your plan?  You put your fist through the wall?  A place where no one will ever get out alive?  Are we in London?  Hey.  I was just at the bank, and there was this really hot teller, and she didn’t ask me to go do it with her in the vault.  What, no, \"Nice apartment, I bet the bedrooms are huge?\"  Y’know what, we have to turn off the porn.  All right, ready?  Two.  Yeah, that’s kinda a relief.  You wanna see if we still have it?  FREE PORN!!!  We have free porn here!!!  Pheebs, I don’t understand. How can you have a roommate that none of us know anything about?  Hey-hey! I thought Naked Thursday’s was just our thing man!  Who was it?  Sure!  Well, I like that idea. Obviously! I was thinking maybe-maybe-maybe it could be a game room, y’know? I mean you can buy old arcade games like uh, like Space Invaders and Asteroids for $200, the real ones! The big-big ones!  Okay so you mean no as in, \"Gee Chandler, what an interesting idea. Let’s discuss it before we reject it completely.\"  So, that’s it?  Which is why Asteroids is perfect! It’s the oldest game!  I don’t have anything against the beautiful guest room, especially since everybody we know lives about 30 seconds away!  Nothing, Monica and I had a stupid fight.  Hi.  Really?  Ohh.  That’s a great idea! We can easily think of a way for us both to enjoy the room.  We don’t have to come up with this now.  Hey, y’know what? Why don’t we think about changes we can make in the living room?  Is that a problem?  Oh, that’s cool. Then I’ll just bring them both over.  Okay, I get it. So, I get nothing! Nothing here is mine! Everything here is yours! I’ll get up in the morning put on your clothes, and head off to work!  In the game room!  Why did you take the shower curtain down?  Well, we are fond of the silliness, but we also have a soft spot for the love.  That’s laughter.  I don’t know.  Yeah, I do.  He’s being silly, because he knows that we enjoy the silliness!  Yeah, I\\'m not so worried.  Of course!  Scared me out of ever wanting to live with him.  Okay!  Oh my God! Someone’s killed Square Man!  Oh that’s so sweet! I want to show you something too!  Y’know those big-big uh, road signs that say \"Merge?\"  Y’know? So I was thinking that we could get one of those signs and hang it over our bed. Because, that’s you and I together! Merge!  Really?!  Yeah, it was time. The old condom ring in the leather just doesn’t say ‘cool’ anymore.  Oh yeah, gym member. I try to go four times a week, but I’ve missed the last 1200 times.  You don’t think I’ve tried? You think I like having 50 dollars taken out of my bank account every month? No, they make you go all the way down there! Then they use all of these phrases and peppiness to try and confuse you! Then they bring out Maria.  Oh Maria. You can’t say no to her, she’s like this lycra spandex covered gym…treat.  No!  Oh no, you’ll have to come.  Why don’t you just give him to somebody else?  Because that’s the only part of you he can see when he’s on the table!  No! I want a flabby gut and saggy man breasts!  I wanna quit the gym.  Hey.  No, I almost did, couldn’t leave Ross there without a spotter!  We’re doomed. Okay, they’re gonna take 50 bucks out of our accounts for the rest of our lives. What are we gonna do?  You’re a genius!  Now, there’s two reasons.  Thank you, Joey.  Hi.  No, we’d just like to close them.  I wanna quit the bank!  To pay for the gym.  Hey.  Yeah… Bunny-rabbit.  Oh my God!  Oh my God!! Is everybody getting married?!!  Hey!  Yes! Well that-yes.  We actually missed it.  What?!  Hi!  So, has anyone talked to Dr. and Mrs. Geller yet?  It’s a buffet man.  Listen, I gotta talk to you.  Monica and I almost got married last night.  Look, I just don’t think Monica and I are ready to get married yet! Y’know? I mean, I love her and everything but seeing Ross and Rachel coming out of that chapel was like a, like a wake-up call that Monica and I are moving so fast. Y’know? And, how do I tell her without crushing her?  What?!  Hey!  Are we gonna talk about what you guys did last night? Or…  Well, I think, I think, Ross already has one. Now, this one’s free, right? Because you paid for the first two, so the third one’s free.  I don’t know. But I-I-I know I love you!  So where are we on the whole going back to the place where they have all the marriages thing? I love you.  Sounds great.  Ready!  That was so unlikely. Well, let’s get married! I guess.  That’s right! It was the wrong kind of eight, no wedding! Damnit!  Well you did pull his hair.  I’m not getting into this again!  No!  All right, should we just, should we just get married? Y’know? I mean should we just do it? All the signs are telling us to do it.  Me too!  No!  Well, what if all my stuff was here?  Okay. What if we lived together and you understand what I’m saying?  Me asking is kind of a sign.  Okay!!!!!  Okay.  Oh thanks.  Okay, a little problem. The key broke in the lock and I can’t get in!  This is not a sign!  It’s an old key!  I love you!  Are you hugging the door right now.  Yeah-yeah, me neither.  The key’s stuck in the lock.  Oh.  Nice job Joe! You’re quite the craftsmen.  Ehh, you\\'re just liquored up.  I\\'ve had a very long, hard day.  Ahh, no thanks. No chicken, bye-bye then.  For the last time no! Get out! Get out, Joey!  Are you okay? I\\'m so sorry, he wouldn\\'t leave. He kept asking me about chicken.  Hey Joe!  Yeah, can I get a 3-piece, some cole slaw, some beans, and a Coke-(Yelps in  Hey, Pheebs!  Uh, The Wheatsheaf.  Ooh! Ahh, Pheebs, was gonna tell a story.  I can\\'t believe she can out run you man!  Oh, Ross, when you make out card; be sure to make it out to, EM-I-LY.  Oh that\\'s not true.  Okay, I gotta go to work.  And uh, Rachel, glad to have you back.  All right, y\\'know what, we\\'ve been talking about London too much haven\\'t we?  I got caught up and work, but I\\'m quitting tomorrow.  I was just trying to bring a little culture to the group.  Hey, Pheebs!  Okay, Pheebs, we decided the picnic idea was a little… Y\\'know, it didn\\'t have any… It-it, well it blew. So, we thought, that this afternoon that we would all go away for the whole weekend to, Atlantic City!  Atlantic City!  Pheebs! We have to take you to the hospital now!  I know, it\\'s beautiful. Amazing.  Y\\'know what else I can\\'t believe? I had to kiss Phoebe and Rachel every time I left a room, I mean it\\'s too bad they didn\\'t see us having sex.  No.  Maybe the problem was you were pronouncing it kara-tay.  Sure I would!  What, you guys really think that I’m that shallow?  What if I had had the guts to quit my job? I’d probably be writing for the New Yorker, getting paid to be funny. But my job’s fun too! I mean tomorrow, I-I don’t have to wear a tie.  Oh I just got another rejection letter. They said my writing was funny, just not \"Archie Comic funny.\"  Was his question what’s more boring than him?  Hey, I may have no money, but I still have my pride.  Ehh.  I could use the money; it could give me time to write.  Okay!  All right!  Hey.  Well it’s kinda hard to be friends with Drake because of his busy schedule and the fact that he’s not real.  Uh-oh, it’s my boss!  What?  But the Kit-Kats are all right?!  Phoebe, are you having a heart attack?!  Oh just great. He beeps me now with codes. One is, \"Bring me food.\" Two is, \"I’m with a girl, bring us food.\" Three is, \"I’m lost and I can’t find food.\"  Yeah?  I’m sorry, I guess I just like the pulp.  Okay, anything for you sir?  Who sold a story to Archie Comics?!  Aww.  You wanna share it?  What’s this?  Oh you wouldn’t uh, care. It’s just a stupid comic book story.  No, the doctors say it may kill her.  Listen Phoebe, he’s right. People are not supposed to have heart attacks at 31.  Uh, what about y’know the massage thing? That never gave you a heart attack.  I’m sorry you’re here with me instead of Roger.  Okay.  What was tonight?  Four different women! I’ve had sex way more times!  Nine.  Well good, good for you. You really think that Roger is the perfect guy?  Hey that’s what I tell girls about me.  No you are not! You are sweet and wonderful and this is gonna happen for you.  So was I.  We can’t do this.  I do like that.  Well, if it helps there were only three. So it would just be for tonight, right?  Stop it! We’re doing this! Let’s do it!  I have some moves.  Yeah, let’s just forget it.  Okay!  Oh yeah.  Oh my God!  Hey!  Let me tell you about this chick I scored with last night! Oh no wait a minute that was you!  So you uh, want to do something tonight?  Yeah! Totally! Totally, and you?  I bet he can.  Yeah I know, guess who beeped him?  Yeah! When you were talking about Roger, that was killing me! Look, things like last night they don’t just happen. Y’know? Or at least not to me. Or with the other two women, in the morning y’know I was just lying there and I couldn’t wait to just go hang out with my friends, but with you I always y’know with a friend.  I know you probably don’t want to go out with me, y’know because I make too many jokes and I’ve never been in a serious relationship and I guess I’m not technically a \"doctor…\"  No, there were two.  Oh yeah.  Wow! Pregnancy does give you some weird cravings.  What are you writing?  Hi guys!  Without me?!  Yes, but in Ross’s case, they both know in two weeks that’s it.  Maybe that’s because soy-burgers suck!  What are you talking about?  Like what?  I said, \"Like what?\"  Does for me.  Flashdance.  She was a welder.  What are the odds? What are the odds?  Okay.  Hey.  Oh-ho, yeah!  Hey, you guys!  So, what do you think?  I got glasses!  No I didn’t!  No!  Really?  That’s okay Pheebs, we’re not having a party or anything, so you don’t have to get us…  What we want honey.  Dying people say the craziest things.  Our kids are gonna be fat aren’t they.  Hey! How’s the boat?!  Well, it’s good that you finally have a place to do that.  Do you know what I was thinkin’?  Uh why, do you have a lecture?  Then free as a bird. What’s up?  Well, did-did you correct him?  Oh no problem, maybe I’ll play with my left hand.  Does anybody know me?!  Don’t worry about it Pheebs.  An old cookie?  We can’t accept this.  ‘Cause it’s gross.  Okay, we owe you a present.  I will tell the story! It was going great. I let him win. We were bonding. He even said I could call him dad.  Guys?  I know.  Why do they put so much steam in there?!  Why? Okay? Why? Wh-wh-why did that have to happen?  Not that big a deal? There…there was touching of things.  I don’t want him to tell this story for years.  If that is your father calling to tell this story then the marriage is off!  So you understand, I’d feel a lot more comfortable if you didn’t tell people what happened. Y’know, I’m a little…I’m a little embarrassed about it.  What did you do when they found out?  So I guess we wear swimsuits in here!  Hey, I\\'m sorry, I should have given you guys my black book when I got married! Although it wasn\\'t so much a book as a... napkin. With Janice\\'s phone number on it.  Is Monica not here?  Oh, then I\\'ll tell you. My agency was bidding for a big account and they got it! It\\'s my first national commercial!  Oh... I don\\'t know, I really don\\'t think you\\'re right for the part.  First of all. Bravo. Uh, but I really don\\'t think you\\'re right for this. The part calls for a stuffy college professor.  Software that facilitates inter-business networking e-solutions?  Hey you guys.  Joe, I told you, you\\'re just not right for the part.  Joe...  Fine!  Work, Joe!  He\\'s not right for the part. So if I suggest him, my bosses are gonna think I\\'m an idiot! And that\\'s something they should learn on their own!  Hey Joe!  Bad news. I watched the tape and passed it along to my bosses and they weren\\'t interested.  I\\'m not lying to you, I watched it!  I watched it!  I can\\'t believe Joey. I hate being called a liar!  What did I just say?  Yes, and I have to say, I am not just hurt. I am insulted. When I tell somebody I did something...  Why are you so sure I didn\\'t watch this tape?  He really is a chameleon.  Look, I\\'m sorry I didn\\'t give them your tape. And I promise, next time to submit you whether I think you are right for the part or not.  I know. You\\'re right. What\\'s it gonna take for you to forgive me?  Lying is wrong!  I\\'m a pretty little girl.  It’s your mommy. It’s your mommy.  That was one of the worse things ever. And not just on TV.  And say nothing?  Hi sweetie. So, what was with all the whispering?  Secret? Married people aren’t supposed to have secrets between one another. We have too much love and respect for one another.  No I’m serious, we should tell each other everything. I do not have any secrets from you.  Oh no-no, I can’t do that.  Okay.  So, Ross and I are going to Disneyland and we stop at this restaurant for tacos. And when I say restaurant, I mean a guy, a hibachi, and the trunk of his car. So Ross has about 10 tacos. And anyway, we’re on Space Mountain and Ross starts to feel a little iffy.  That’s it?! I gave up my Disneyland story for that?  What about him?  Hey.  Oh it’s always nicer to here than, \"Aw crap! You again!\"  Hey.  Oh yeah?  Did you not understand the story?  Hey! What’s up?  Huh.  I had too okay?! We’re getting married! Married couples can’t keep secrets from one another!  Du-ude!  Did you not hear me say, \"Du-ude?!\"  In my defense, it was dark and he was a very pretty guy.  Ho-ho, so hard we had to throw out your underwear again?  You wanna tell secrets?! Okay! Okay! In college, Ross used to wear leg warmers!  Ross came in forth and cried!  Hey!!!  That was you!  Y’know when I said that because we’re getting married that we should share everything and not have any secrets?  Yeah that was stupid. Let’s not do that.  Yeah, and not that you would, but I wouldn’t hang out with…all the guys in my office.  We got the honeymoon.  The wedding pictures?  Not the disposable cameras from the tables.  I’ll tell you what, I will go get them developed and you can go home.  What? What did you take a picture of?  Okay Ross has the cameras, has he checked out yet?  Oh.  Score! Where are the disposable cameras?  The cameras? Remember last night I told you to take them?  Yes! Remember? Right before we cut the cake, I went up to you and I said…  So you don’t have the cameras?!  So? What? What? They’re gone! Monica’s gonna freak!  Great.  Hey! Did you find the cameras?  Yes! And that’s why I’m under the table. Celebrating.  Well this is great. Y’know, those cameras were the only thing that was gonna cheer Monica up today, she’s really depressed.  All my energy is going into not asking that question. I can’t believe I screwed this up!  Are you suggesting we dance our troubles away?  Are you serious?  Marriage advice? Really?!  I don’t know, Monica picked out the flowers.  She picked those out too.  That was her.  I was in charge of the cameras! Gift shop?  Who are you? Ansel Adams?! Get outta here!  Why don’t you go up on stage. I’ll get a picture of you doing the speech.  Okay, you ready for the last picture?  We’re back!  It’s picture time.  Eh?  Call it even?!  Oh, yeah! How did you meet her?  Were you so late because you were burring this woman?  All right, who keeps leaving old newspapers in the trash?! I really wanted to take Kathy to this, I can’t believe I missed it.  Really?! I didn’t think girls ever just wanted a fling.  Y’know what? There’s some nice guys at my office, do you want me to set you up?  Well, I have a girlfriend, I’m-I’m happy. So, I no longer feel the need to go out of my way to stop others from being happy.  Oh and Ross was like what? A lion tamer?  Hey, you know what you can do? I remember reading about this director, I think it was Orson Wells, who at the beginning of the movie would hire somebody, just so he could fire them in front of everybody. Then they would all know, who’s boss.  See my friend-my friend, Rachel, she wants to be set up.  Oh, y’know what, that might be okay even if it was just kind of a fling, that might be all right with Rachel.  Oh well, that’s uh, a little later than I uh, generally care to stay, but sure!  Well, I don’t really know what that is, but let’s!!  Wherever! I’ve got like 20!  Y’know what, I’m gonna uh, play the field just a little more.  Guys are signing over their 401-K’s to me?  Yes, and his father invented that magnetic strip on the back of credit cards.  See, I’m not bad at this fixing up thing, huh?  Oh, he works in the Fine Foods division.  It’s a big company, I don’t—if you—I…  Oh yeah! With who?  Yeah.  Hey, man!  Well, like father, like son.  Really?! I-I thought you weren’t looking for something serious? I thought you were looking for some kind of a fling.  Ummmmmmmm, no.  Why not?! I’d be thrilled if I heard that some hot girl was just looking to get—oh I see.  I’m not Jewish, so…  Bad dream?  Oh yeah, then uh, what was Phoebe’s song about?  Prague?  I did! I absolutely did!  I’m sure you’re right, but why?  Oh, man. I’m sorry, I’m so-so sorry.  I know! I know!  Yeah! You graduated Magma Ku Laude, right?  Well, actually it’s a hockey team, so it’s angry Canadians with no teeth.  Have you ever been with a woman?  So there is no good time to ask that question.  Taste it.  Yeah, I know, I did that two minutes ago.  Hey, mister tux!  You\\'re in my seat.  \\'Cause I was sitting there.  Well, it\\'s not like I went to Spain. I went to the bathroom, you knew I was coming back.  The big deal is I was sitting there last, so, that\\'s my seat.  Well, Joey, I wrote a little song today. It\\'s called: Get Up.  Really!  Honey, you did call him back. \\'Cause, it\\'s, it\\'s really old.  Maybe he\\'s calling to say your obsessive and crazy.  Maybe it was his sister\\'s. You know, maybe it was his daughter\\'s.  All right, you will notice that I am fully dressed. I, in turn, have noticed that you are not. So in the words of A. A. Milne, \"Get out of my chair, dillhole!\"  What are you doing?  The cushions are the essence of the chair!  Oh-ho, it\\'ll be back. Oh-ho, there\\'s nobody in the room.  We used them as pillows when we went camping.  He took my essence!  Well, then it looks like somebody is gonna have to give back somebody his cushions.  What are you, what are you gonna show me my clothes?  He\\'s got nothing!  What are you supporting?  Monica, I think you\\'ve gone over to the bad place.  They got a phone in there, right?  Is it wrong that I was totally aroused by that?  Oh my God! That is so not the opposite of taking somebody\\'s underwear!!  Oooo-ooh!  Jeez, what a baby.  Stop it. Stop it!  Excuse me. Hi.  Well, your kind of sitting in my seat.  I mean, I was sitting there.  But, I never left the room!  All right, that\\'s it, give me your underwear.  First of the month.  No, just the months you actually want to live here.  That’s our phone number. Now look, I know I kinda sprung this whole me moving out on thing, so why don’t I just—why don’t I just cover you for a while?  It’s not charity, Joe…  Uh, yeah.  So, we’ll do the rest of the bills later then?  No, I hope not! I tried to offer him some money, but he wouldn’t take it.  I figure that $1,500 would cover him for a few months, y’know? But I have to trick him into taking it so I won’t hurt his pride.  Well that would help the pride thing.  Hey! Wow! You look great! Wanna move in with me tomorrow?  Hey!  Well, instead of just hanging out, we figure we’d do nothing.  Oh nope, I-I have plans with Joey.  Yes, but for the last time.  He’s at a dinner party.  Oh, I wish I’d know you were going to do that, I ordered Chinese.  Say, Joe, I had a strange idea of what we could do for our last night. What do you say we play a little uh, foosball for money?  Yes it would. What do you say to $50?  Okay, let’s play! The big game, Italy vs. China, apparently.  Okay, give me a chance to win my money back. Okay? Sudden death, one goal, $1,000.  Oh yes!  Okay.  See? Now, that’s why only the little fake men are supposed to do all the kicking.  Still broken?  Okay, uh, how about, how about—y’know what? We could play a new game. A new game, it’s fun.  Cups.  I’ll teach ya! Come on, come on, it’s really easy and really, really fun.  Ho-ho, you win! 50 dollars!  You’re kidding right?  You win.  It doesn’t matter because nothing beats a three and a six. That my friend is D-Cup. Okay, now much have you won so far?  Not 700 exactly?  Well you see in Cups, once you get $700, you have to double it.  What’s wrong?  Wh-How did you lose at Cups?!  Oh man!!  All right, let’s play one more hand! One more!  I can’t take the big white dog! You love it!  When did I try to give you money?  I’m just trying to help you out! Okay? I wanna make sure that you’re okay.  Sure!  I invented the game of Cups as a way to give Joey money.  Exactly.  It’s not a real game! I made it up!  At a fake game!!  Okay! Now I assume the Saucer card came up when you played last.  Okay, well tonight’s the big night.  It is going to be perfect. I am taking her to her favorite restaurant. I’m going to get her a bottle of the champagne that she really loves; therefore knows how expensive it is. Then when the glasses are full, instead of proposing a toast I’m just gonna propose.  Yeah.  I’m not gonna mess it up.  She’s not gonna say no.  Hey!  Phoebe!  Hey!  I just get mad when Rachel doesn’t remember where we’re going.  Well, you could also give back the money you owe me.  Oh, so you’re already doing your part for the kids.  Wait a minute, all jokes aside? I didn’t agree to that!  Okay, now will you guys get out of here? I want this is to be a surprise and she’s gonna know.  Yes! Yes! I’m good! Are you good? Are you good? Is everything—are you—are you perrr-perfect?!  Yes! I’m fine. In fact I’ve been fine for a long time now and I think, the reason is you.  Okay umm, before I meant you I had really little life and I couldn’t imagine growing old with…  Hi.  I got a good one, I got a good one! I once walked in on both my parents making love to the same guy.  What?!  Richard!  Oh you knew that. Good!  For camp!  Hey, you have to forget about Elizabeth. I mean if you’re not careful you may not get married at all this year!  Richard was there so I couldn’t do it!  I’m gonna do it tomorrow y’know, and-and surprise her, but now you’ve ruined it!  Who walks into a room and asks to see a person’s hands?!  This is terrible. What am I going to do?  That’s right, I can throw her off. I can make her think marriage is the last thing on my mind.  I can do that, I’ve had 30 years of practice.  Hey!  Yeah, well… Y’know, it just got me thinking though, why would anybody ever want to get married huh?  Eh…  Sure I do. In fact, I think the whole concept of marriage is unnatural. I mean look at pigs. Let’s take a second here and look at pigs. Okay pigs don’t mate for life. I mean a pig can have like a hundred sexual partners in a lifetime, and that’s just an ordinary pig not even a pig that’s good at sports!  If marriage worked, I’d be all for it. But do you know what the divorce rate in this country is? 97%.  Well, never say never but y’know probably uh yeah, never.  Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! What is all this pressure?! Is this some new kind of strategy? Why don’t you put down your copy of ‘The Rules’ huh mantrap?!  I was making a coconut phone with the professor.  What?!  My—Oh my God!  He’s not supposed to ask my girlfriend to marry him! I’m supposed to do that!  You’re right.  Okay great.  What?!  Well where did she go?  Oh my God, I can’t believe this! Y’know, I thought…I thought you were a good guy.  Nothing happened? Nothing? So you didn’t tell my girlfriend that you love her?  Y’know what? I can’t believe this! Do you know what you did? My girlfriend is out there thinking things over! You made my girlfriend think!!  And what does she have to think about? I love her!  But I am willing to offer her all those things. This was just a plan, y’know? A way to throw her off course so that when I offered her all these things, she’d be surprised!  Y’know Richard…you are a good guy.  I can’t talk to you now, I gotta find Monica!  What?  What are you talking about?  Well why didn’t you stop her?! Why didn’t you just tell her it was a plan?!  Well where… Where did she go?  I can’t believe I ruined this.  Oh my God.  I\\'m sorry!  Rachel, wait, wait.  Can I just say one thing?  That\\'s a relatively open weave and I can still see your... nipular areas.  Okay.  No, she\\'s still upset because I saw her boobies.  It was an accident. Not like I was across the street with a telescope and a box of donuts.  Y\\'know, I don\\'t know why you\\'re so embarrassed, they were very nice boobies.  Whoah whoah, back up there, Sparky. What\\'d you mean by that?  Huh.  Uhhuh, how did you know that?  Y\\'know, I don\\'t see that happening?  Well I\\'m not showing you my \\'tat.\\'  Oh, it\\'s nothing, it\\'s a little thing... I hate that guy.  Oh look, it\\'s the woman we ordered.  Uh, Joey\\'s having an embolism, but I\\'d go for a Nip, y\\'know?  Joey, if I go first, I wanna be looking for my keys.  So, who\\'s up for a big game of Kerplunk?  C\\'mon, I\\'ll show you to my room. ...That sounds so weird when it\\'s not followed by \"No thanks, it\\'s late.\"  Hey, Kicky. What\\'re you doing?  Well, you\\'re gonna.  Are they end to end, or tall like pancakes?  Hey, you\\'re not him. You\\'re you. When they were all over you to go into your father\\'s pipe-fitting business, did you cave?  No. You decided to go into the out-of-work actor business. Now that wasn\\'t easy, but you did it! And I\\'d like to believe that when the right woman comes along, you will have the courage and the guts to say \"No thanks, I\\'m married.\"  Yeah. I really do.  Get off!  Sorry, my my thing was in there with me.  Basically we just feel that he\\'s...  Things sure have changed here on Waltons mountain.  If I turn into my parents, I\\'ll either be an alcoholic blond chasing after twenty-year-old boys, or... I\\'ll end up like my mom.  So, you and Rachel tonight, huh?  Wow! So tonight may be the night! You\\'re nervous?  What must it be like not to be crippled by fear and self-loathing.  How can you be so confident?  Really? Like you have a routine?  Really?  ...and beer!!  Hey! Stop staring at my wife\\'s legs! No no! Stop staring at your sister\\'s legs!  She went on one of those spray-on tan places.  Sure, then you should get a mini skirt so you can really show it off.  Hey Pheebs!  Who\\'s Amanda?  Are you trying to do a British accent?  Just so I know, how many more of those can I expect?  No, had it done to me though. Feels good !  Hello? Is someone on the line?  Hold on! There is something different.  Was that place... The Sun?  Oh My God! You can do a duet of Ebony and Ivory all by yourself!  How was your date with Joey?  You didn\\'t like that?  If she asks, I protested a little, but ok!  Well, aren\\'t you a treat.  That fake British woman is a real bitch, but she sure can dance... Hey!  Kinda... you know, sneaking around, having to hide from you guys...  Actually, no. No, it felt right. You know, it felt like uhm... I can\\'t believe we haven\\'t been doing this the whole time.  Dude, it\\'s Chandler. Let me in.  I know, I went to the tanning place and the same thing happened to me. You have to let me in.  No, I just had to get a picture of this.  I see you later!  Die Hard still great!  What’d you rent?  Yeah, I just got uh, got plans.  No, see the thing is I want to get out of here before Joey gets all worked up and starts calling everybody bitch.  That’s sweet.  So uh, what did this woman look like?  Well, is there any chance you were looking into a bright, shiny thing called a mirror?  Julie Grath, my camp girlfriend.  Well, ‘cause she came back the third summer and she’d gotten really fa-aa-aw-ow…  I did not say fat! I said, \"Fa-aa-aw-ow…\"  Yeah. Yeah, but it was a really, really long time ago! Does she still feel bad?  Can you figure out what I’m doing?  Who?  Because you kept talking to him while he was trying to go to the bathroom?!  What? Are you kidding? That was like 16 years ago.  Okay, I will do it. But I have to warn you; this may make me a better person and that is not the man you feel in love with!  Ah, uh, I owe you a long overdue apology. I never should have broken up with you because you were overweight.  As bad as that went I actually enjoyed myself. I think that I’m going to apologize for all of the stupid things I do.  I would really love it if could do both.  What?  What?!  A hundred and forty-five pounds.  Look I know it was a stupid reason to break up with somebody, but I was 15!  Okay. Okay, now wait a minute that was totally different.  You were not supposed to hear that! I said that behind you back!  So you can balloon up or you can shrink down and I will still love you.  I’d carry you around in my pocket.  Skidmark’s still got a way with the ladies.  You can always spot someone who\\'s never seen one of his plays before. Notice, no fear, no sense of impending doom...  No, ten o\\'clock.  She\\'s amazing! She makes the women that I dream about look like short, fat, bald men!  Oh yeah, and what would my opening line be? \\'Excuse me. Blarrglarrghh.\\'  Oh please, could she be more out of my league? Ross, back me up here.  Thank you, buddy.  Y\\'think?  Oh God, I can\\'t believe I\\'m even considering this... I\\'m very very aware of my tongue...  Hey, kids.  Well, I can\\'t believe I\\'ve been here almost seven seconds and you haven\\'t asked me how my date went.  It was unbelievable. I-I\\'ve never met anyone like her. She\\'s had the most amazing life! She was in the Israeli army...  Alright. Once I got on the subway, right, and it was at night, and I rode it all the way to Brooklyn... just for the hell of it.  We talked \\'til like two. It was this perfect evening... more or less.  Oh, I\\'m sorry, so \\'we\\' is?  Who\\'s Rick?  Oh, so you\\'re divorced?  Oh, I\\'m sorry, then you\\'re widowed?...Hopefully?  So tell me, how do- how do you think your husband would feel about you sitting here with me?...Sliding your foot so far up my pant leg you can count the change in my pocket?  Ethan? There\\'s, there\\'s an Ethan?  So explain something to me here, uh, what kind of a relationship do you imagine us having if you already have a husband and a boyfriend?  ...Hm.  What \\'not work out\\'? I\\'m seeing her again on Thursday. Didn\\'t you listen to the story?  Well, y\\'know, I had some trouble with it at first too, but the way I look at it is, I get all the good stuff: all the fun, all the talking, all the sex; and none of the responsibility. I mean, this is every guy\\'s fantasy!  Are we greeting each other this way now? \\'Cause I like that.  Thank God you didn\\'t try to fan out the magazines. I mean, she\\'ll scratch your eyes right out.  Someone\\'s left a glass on the coffee table. There\\'s no coaster. It\\'s a cold drink, it\\'s a hot day. Little beads of condensation are inching their way closer and closer to the surface of the wood...  Oh no, it\\'s terrific, it\\'s... it\\'s... y\\'know, you deserve this, after all your years of struggling, you\\'ve finally been able to crack your way into showbusiness.  Where\\'s Joey? His mom\\'s on the phone.  Oh, that would be Monica. Hey, listen, I wanna borrow a coupla things, Aurora spent the night, I really wanna make her breakfast.  God, I love these fingers...  No, actually I meant my fingers. Look at \\'em, look at how happy they are.  Don\\'t go.  Well, I thought- I thought you talked to Rick.  What, Ethan? He got to spend the whole day with you!  I know there\\'ll be many moments in the years to come when I\\'ll regret asking the following question, but- And Andrew is?  Oh, so what you\\'re saying is you\\'re not completely fulfilled by Rick, Ethan and myself?  Well, y\\'know, most women would kill for three guys like us.  You.  Nono, just you.  Lose the other guys.  C\\'mon, we\\'re great together, why not?  ...Well, y\\'know, part of me wants that, but it\\'s like I\\'m two guys, y\\'know? I mean, one guy\\'s going \\'Shut up! This is great!\\' But there\\'s this other guy. Actually it\\'s the same guy that wells up every time that Grinch\\'s heart grows three sizes and breaks that measuring device... And he\\'s saying, y\\'know, \\'This is too hard! Get out! Get out!\\'  I don\\'t know, I-I have to listen to both of them, they don\\'t exactly let each other finish...  ...The second guy.  Sorry, the first guy runs the lips.  Something so sweet and...disturbing about that.  Do you think you could get through a poem?  Too?  That’s great!  So great things are happening at work and in your personal life!  Don’t do it.  I think it’s the dying cat parade.  Y’know that thing that Ross was gonna do at our wedding?! He was hanging out with me yesterday and he turned to me and said, \"You’re half Scottish right?\"  Yes!!  Why is your family Ross?!  If you listen very carefully, I think its Celebration by Cool and the Gang.  Well, I feel like a snack!  Oh no thanks. I don’t like any thing from my Scottish heritage.  We heard you play all the way from your apartment!  That’s not really important right now. What is important is; while we appreciate the gesture, we just don’t feel bagpipes are appropriate for our wedding.  Because we hate them.  We have heard you play.  Hey!  So we thought we\\'d throw you little going away party around seven.  Where\\'s your passport?  Well, it\\'s not.  We\\'re taking a break!  Jumping on the bed?  No, no, no, guys. She\\'s right. We should get to work. I\\'ll take stuff out of the closet, Joey you pack \\'em and Ross you re-pack whatever Joey packs.  I didn\\'t know Monica had these!  Why would she use them with Richard and not me? I can be kinky! I once did a naked dance for her... with scarves!  Hey.  Yes, Joe?  Oh, yes. I decided to leave these out for you in case Richard stops by and you wanna engage on a little light bondage and moustache play!  Oh yeah, right! Good luck getting another scarf dance from me!  Really? Then what are they doing in our guestroom?  Uh, Rach?  No, no, no... They\\'re really yours. We... found them in your old room.  Don\\'t say Richard! Well, if they\\'re not Monica\\'s and they\\'re not yours, then whose are they?  Pheebs!  I think these are yours.  Let me just say something... Because once we get into this, I\\'m gonna get all uncomfortable and probably make some stupid joke... I just want to say that I... I love you... And, I\\'m gonna miss you. And I\\'m so sad that you\\'re leaving.  I\\'m sor... Just go. Just go. I can\\'t, I can\\'t.  Oh, you\\'re definately not. I haven\\'t cried like that in years.  That old woman was being scammed by her mechanic.  Mine was a humdinger  Well, you can\\'t say we don\\'t know how to throw a party.  Joey and I can finish up in the guest room.  Hey Mon, I think I figured out whose handcuffs they are.  Well, I was cleaning out the closet and I found some pictures of them... being used.  Monica\\'s grandmother.  Relax! We just get her some antacids.  Oh my God!  Honey, it\\'s gonna be okay.  What?  There\\'s a hair in my coffee.  You know, it\\'s funny. Every time you say \"triplets,\" I immediately think of three hot blonde 19-year olds.  So, a lot of malfunctioning wee-wees and hoo-hoos in this room, huh?  I mean, you have a lovely home.  You want me to wash my hands first, don\\'t you?  Hey, you must be Owen.  I\\'m Chandler. Hey, I was in the scouts too.  Yeah, in fact my father was a den-mother.  You know how to use a compass?  You do? That\\'s fantastic!  I\\'d love to, but I gotta get back to talking to your parents. They\\'re telling us all about how they adopted you.  What?  I got nothing.  Where are Bill and Colleen?  We have to leave!!  I didn\\'t get to the bathroom. I bumped into Owen on the way, and he didn\\'t know he was adopted. And there\\'s a slight chance I may have told him.  But kids are so intuitive. Don\\'t you think on some level he already knows?  See? Intuitive!  Which technically now you should give back!  I\\'m so sorry, but you should have a sign out there or something. Or at least whisper it to people when they come in the door. \"Owen doesn\\'t know he\\'s adopted, and he also thinks that Santa is real.\"  Owen didn\\'t know he was adopted, and Monica told him.  Yeah, but how would you like it if someone told the triplets that you gave birth to them?  Okay.  Hey!!  Oh that’s right. It’s your first day! So are you psyched to fight fake crime with your robot sidekick?  Are you judging them by their covers? Because you’re really not supposed to do that.  Hey!  Wait a minute, hold the phone! You’re not Elizabeth’s dad?!  Ross!  There’s a Mr. Bing!  Yes, we were just…  Hey honey, you got the kind with the little girl, you said we were gonna to get the kind with the baby.  No, the little girl creeps me out.  Why would the baby creep me out?  This is going in your book?  Hey!  Damn those robots, they’re supposed to be our faithful servants!  So do you think uh, Joey’s more charming than me?  Who?  Hmm.  Oh.  Oh-oh.  We said seven!  The only way that I said six would be if the seven’s, let meet at seven, not at six.  Oh my good God.  What?!  Thank you for writing your book. Its-its uh, great book and you are the queen of everything.  So you knew we were gonna miss the movie!  Oh I’m so sorry man! Is there anything I can do?  Hi, how are ya?  Yeah, I’ve been there my friend.  Sorry man.  Did they teach you that in your anger management class?  Oh, we had a lot of liquor left over from the Christmas party.  No, sir.  What?  Oh, that was my work laugh.  Oh, believe me, to survive this party, you\\'re gonna have to come up with one too.  Okay.  Hey! Everybody at work loved you last night!  Okay, easy Martina. I think we should let them win the next game.  Let them win one.  You\\'re not even giving them a chance!  Oopsey, missed it!  It was my racquet.  If we hadn\\'t lost the game they never would\\'ve invented us to dinner tomorrow night.  Okay y\\'know what, because you said that, I\\'m not putting out tonight.  Just a little bit of sugar.  Oh, you get used to it.  So I laugh at my boss\\'s jokes, what\\'s the big deal?  What?  Well, I-I just didn\\'t think it was funny sir.  Well, I just…  Really?  But we\\'re not ready to tell yet!  Man, she is really gullible.  Okay.  Why would I be mad?  I also want you to remember that I let you live here rent free!  Wait. Before we go in, I just want you to know I love you. I had a great time on our honeymoon, and I can’t wait to go in there and spend the rest of our life together.  They’re terrific, and they live right here in the city.  I’m sorry, we’re just kinda excited because we finally have a couple to hang out with.  Listen, they are really great. If you just got a chance…  We really…didn’t get a chance to…  Ross! It’s got your wavy black lines!  Y’know who has a great video camera?  Let’s call ‘em.  What?  I don’t know! You were a delight to talk to. You asked all those insightful, great questions.  I still don’t get it, we didn’t do anything wrong.  I thought you said those jokes were funny. Joke! Joke! Joke!  Well maybe it was all of your questions.  The sheer volume, it was like flying with the Riddler!  Did you do it on our invitations?!  That’s the magic story you use when you wanna have sex!  Jenny! That is so Jenny!   No way!  Yes, yes, we did, thanks to Vidal Buffay.  Ok, I think she\\'s trying to tell us something. Quick, get the verbs.  Well, listen, don\\'t tell us what\\'s gonna happen though, \\'cause I like to be surprised.  Hey, Rach, can I get...  Not yet.  So what the hell happened to you in China? I mean, when last we left you, you were totally in love with, you know.  God?  Well, maybe it was God, doing me.  Well, you owe me one, big guy.  He said...he said, he said that they\\'re having a great time. I\\'m sorry. But, the silver lining, if you wanna see it, is that he made the decision all by himself!  Without any outside help whatsoever.  You have to really wanna see it.  No, no, I\\'m just looking for a man to draw on me with chalk.  Okay.  You have to stop the Q-tip when there\\'s resistance!  Ok, I don\\'t care what you guys say, something\\'s bothering her.  What stupid thing did you do?  People do stupid things when they\\'re upset.  Well, in spite of the yummy bagels and palpable tension, I\\'ve got pants that need to be altered.  Are you sure he\\'s gonna be able to crack that code?  At least as long as I have the pants.  Joey\\'s tailor...took advantage of me.  Oh come on! He said he was going to do my inseam, and he ran his hand up my leg, and then, there was definite...  Cupping.  Come on, Monica, things could be worse. You could get caught between the moon and New York City. I know it\\'s crazy, but it\\'s true.  That\\'s ok.  Yeah Ross, I mean... we\\'re excited to hear the speech but the rest of the time we\\'re gonna wanna do, you know, \"island\\'s stuff\".  Yeah, that\\'s the same as \"it has something to do with wind\".  I wouldn\\'t read too much into it.  David, let me stop you there \\'cause I think I see where this is going. I\\'m not very good at giving advice. So if you want advice, go to Ross, Monica, or... Joey, if the thing you wanna advice about is pizza toppings or burning sensation when you pee.  Seriously, we\\'re gonna do this?  What?  I didn\\'t mean now...  Well, you\\'re welcome! Glad I could help.  David, I\\'m pretending to read here!!  David is going to propose to Phoebe.  Be-cause, we were talking about ways that he could beat Mike and I told him that Phoebe wanted to get married.  I did! A penis one! Look, just so I know, what was so wrong about what I said?  Man, that\\'s some bad advice!  That\\'s why our honeymoon photos look like me and Diana Ross!  David is going to propose to Phoebe tonight!  That would be advice!!  Oh, is it on the computer, cuz I\\'d love to give it a read...?  Your computer, I don\\'t know wha... everything\\'s gone!  It must be a virus. I think it erased your hard drive.  Someone I don\\'t know sent me an e-mail and I opened it.  Well, it didn\\'t say \"This is a virus\"!!  It\\'s not gone! I mean, I\\'m sure you printed out a copy. You have a hard copy, right?  Well, you must be pretty mad at yourself right now...!  I just feel awful.  Phoebe is going to say \"yes\"? That\\'s, that\\'s great!  And there\\'s not chance that will work?  This vacation sucks!!  You know, it\\'s very hard to take you seriously when you look like that.  I wouldn\\'t brag too much about that thing, big guy.  Oh, ain\\'t this nice? It\\'s so quiet, I could just lie here all day.  I\\'m so glad we\\'ve got adjoining rooms!  Hey! Remember when I had corneas?  Ladies? Ross\\'s speech is in 45 minutes.  I don\\'t think so!  Because you know how competitive you get and well, I say it\\'s cute, others disagree, and I\\'m lying!  Oh, yeah? What happened when we played last time?  And...?  I\\'m not playing with you.  Honey, try to focus the trash talk on him!  I think this is the first time in our marriage that I\\'ve felt like the more attractive one.  Okay-dokay, you\\'ve each won a game and I\\'ve lost what\\'s felt like a year of my life. So everybody goes home a winner.  Should I use my invisibility to fight crime or for evil?  Monica, that was also true an hour ago! I mean, please, look at you! Your hand is blistered, you can barely stand, your hair is inexplicable! Ok, you\\'ve already proven you are just as good as he is, now we\\'ve missed our dinner reservations, so now let\\'s just go upstairs, order room service, take a shower and shave your head!  But...  What about the obsessive cleaning?  You ok?  No, you didn\\'t.  Because I\\'m gonna play for ya.  All right Mike, let\\'s get this over with. Sudden death. Whoever wins this point, wins.  And that\\'s... how... it\\'s done!  I never sucked, I actually didn\\'t want you to know how good I was!  I don\\'t know.  That\\'s why!  Mr. Millionaire, new from Snooty Playthings! Third wife sold separately.  Life-sized Imperial Storm Troopers from Sharper Image?  Wow!! Can Joey and I put them on and fight?  Yeah, either that, or Gloria Estefan was right, eventually, the rhythm is going to get you.  And you’re our age. You’re our age.  That’s not a state Joe.  You’re our age!  Is there any chance you didn’t see that?  Ross! You gotta stop! Okay?! You can’t just stare through the peep hole for three hours! You’re gonna get peep eye!  You didn’t just break up.  You slept with somebody three hours after you thought you broke up. I mean bullets have left guns slower!  Okay.  And the inventor of the door rests happily in his grave.  Stop what?!  No!! You can’t!!  Look man!  She’s moving on! Okay, if it’s not this guy, it’s gonna be somebody else! And unless you’re thinking about subletting my peep hole, you are going to have to get used to the fact that the relationship is over! Okay, man? It’s over.  Okay.  Ah, Sliced Bread, a wonderful Lady MacBeth.  I think somebody has a crush on somebody.  I’m talking about you. You big, big freak.  Hey, you have nothing but talk about her for the last 48 hours! If you were in a school yard you’d be pulling her pigtails and pushing her down now!  ‘Cause it’s-it’s not his last name.  No, it’s not like, like Phil Spiderman. He’s a spider, man. Y\\'know like ah, like Goldman is a last name, but there’s no Gold Man.  So, ahh, what kind of powers would Gold Man have?  What about things that are already gold?  Okay, let’s play my game now.  Hey! Wow, it is true what they say, pregnant bellies look like a drum.  All right.  Wouldn’t that be Frank the III?  Hey! Do we have a baby name yet?  Well, it certainly worked for that Valdez kid.  Well, Chandler will be there for you too. I mean, well, he might be a little late, but-but, he’ll be there. And he’ll bring you some cold soda, if want you need him for is that you’re really hot.  Hey!  And now you’re giving me the message!  You actually think that something can happen between Emily and Susan?  Hi! Hi! You’re crazy! Okay? This is Emily. Emily is straight.  Raymond Chandler.  Okay, there are no famous Joey’s. Except for, huh, Joey Buttafucco.  Okay, look, Joey! Come on, think about it, first of all, he’ll never be President. There’s never gonna be a President Joey.  Wow, you’re, you’re right. I have a horrible, horrible name.  Okay.  No, no, you’re right, it is a ridiculous name!  Yes it is! From now on, I have no first name.  I have no name.  Okay uh, for now, temporarily, you can call me, Clint.  Okay, so what name am I cool enough to pull off?  It’s Clint! Clint!  All right look, am I serious, okay? Tomorrow at 3:30 I am going down to the courthouse.  Hey, look, this name has been holding me back my entire life. Okay, it’s probably why kids picked on me in school, and why I never do well with women… So, as of 4 o’clock tomorrow, I’m either gonna be Mark Johnson or John Markson.  Okay. Thanks.  You wanna hug it out?  Yay!  Okay!  Bye, Pheebs!  Ha! Ha! Ha!  Ross and the most beautiful girl in the world.  Okay, but that\\'s, like, the easiest era.  Hi. You guys have any wrapping paper?  Phebes, it was your birthday, like, months ago.  Well, I have a call in about that.  Actually, this is for Kathy\\'s birthday. It\\'s an early edition of her favorite book.  Okay, but don\\'t touch it, because you fingers have destructive oils.  Oh, it wasn\\'t a big deal. I just went to a couple of bookstores, talked to a couple of dealers... called a couple of the author\\'s grandchildren.  It doesn\\'t say that. Does it?  Okay, all right, I\\'ll just uh, make sure that uh, Joey gets her something really great.  I don\\'t know... um, Grease?  Rent?  Okay, so when do you want to go?  Yes, it is, at Office Max.  A pen.  Huh-huh! You can\\'t give her that.  Because she\\'s not eleven! And it\\'s not the seventh night of Hanukkah!  All right, look, look. What did... what did you get for Angela Delveccio for her birthday?  For three years?  All right. I will go out and I will try to find something for her, okay?  Would you like me to write her a little poem as well?  Okay, all right. I just spent the entire afternoon looking for a present for Kathy that would be better than the rabbit.  She\\'s really going to love this, you know? The bottom line is I want her to have it, even if I don\\'t get to be the one who gives it to her.  Yeah? You don\\'t think it\\'s just pathetic?  Where?  No, it\\'s a book that\\'s just a book, okay? It\\'s an early edition of the Velveteen Rabbit. It was her favorite book as a kid. So, uh, just... let me know if she likes it, okay?  No, it came out to an even twenty.  Hey, how\\'d it go? How\\'d she like the gift?  Oh yeah? That\\'s great!  Hey! Happy birthday.  Happy birthday! I\\'m sorry.  See, you think it\\'s just a pen, but then you turn it over and it\\'s also a clock.  Oh, yeah... yeah.  Oh, uh, yeah... I just knew that sometimes when you\\'re writing, you... you don\\'t always know the exact time.  Uh, the book?  What do you mean?  Oh, yeah, he\\'s my... he\\'s my best friend.  You know, I once dated a Miss Crankypants. Lovely girl, kinda moody.  Monica, will you stop? This is nuts. Do you know how long it\\'s gonna be before you actually have to deal with this problem? I mean, you don\\'t even have a boyfriend yet. Joey, she does not look fat.  We\\'ll watch him.  I was looking forward to playing basketball, but I guess that\\'s out the window.  You understood that?  Is he the one with the beautiful wife?  You know, I don\\'t think we brought enough stuff. Did you forget to pack the baby\\'s anvil?  No, I got him.  Oh, seriously you want him?  Well, don\\'t, don\\'t think me immodest, but, me?  Well, we are great guys.  That\\'s a good plan, Joe. Next time we wanna pick up women, we should just go to the park and make out. Taxi, taxi!  Ok, but can you tell him that, because he thinks he\\'s too pink.  You done?  You know it?  Oh, sure, they love us over there.  Oh, that\\'s good. Maybe he\\'ll hear you and pull the cord.  That\\'s me.  Please tell me you know which one is our baby.  Ok.  Yeah?  Hey, Ben, remember us? Ok, the mole came off.  What\\'re we gonna do? What\\'re we gonna do?  Oh, we\\'re gonna flip for the baby?  All right, call it in the air.  Heads it is.  We have to assign heads to something.  What kind of scary-ass clowns came to your birthday?  You, you are gonna love this.  Stay back, I\\'ve got kiwi. Run, Joey, Run!  …Come on! Why are we here?!  The hot chicks?  Wow that’s actually pretty cool.  Sounds like two people are really enjoying the Dewey decimal system.  You didn’t bring me here to do that, did you?  OH…MY…GAWD! I am so sorry sweetie, are you okay? You didn’t tell her we were getting married, did you?  Did she freak out?  Right.  You said no right?!  Lie!!! How hard is that?! The check’s in the mail! Oh your baby is so cute! I can’t wait to read your book Ross!!  What do you think she’s just gonna sit there quietly? You don’t think she’s gonna want to make a toast? You don’t think she’s gonna want to grab the microphone and sing Part-time Lover?!  Y’know what? It’s gonna be okay. Y’know what? She’s probably not gonna even want to come.  No! That was a lie! See how easy that was?  Yes!!  Yes!!!  Well actually uh, there was something we wanted to tell you about the wedding. Um, it’s going to be a small ceremony. Uh, tiny! We’re not even sure why we’re having it.  I say we go with Careless Whisper.  Aren’t you just a tinsy bit curious?  No-no-no-no, if we let her stay, she will stay forever!  Is that what you’re thinking about right now?  Janice, I’m sorry but umm, you can’t stay here tonight.  Honestly? Our apartment is a hotbed for electromagnetic activity. Now Monica and I have been immunized, but sadly you have not.  Say again?  Feelings, such strong feelings.  If I was a superhero who could fly and be invisible, that would be the best.  What a wank!  See, that’s why I could never be an actor. Because I can’t say gig.  Knock, knock.  Okay, well it this bed isn’t new, how come there is plastic on the mattress?  You told him to play the boxer gay!!  You totally screwed him over.  What?! What are you talking about?  Who’s the father?  Why not?  As in Barbara Streisand’s husband James Brolin?  Y’know I am the groom right? I was told it was kinda big deal.  Before we go out there I’ve got a present for ya.  No?  I’ve been taking dancing lessons.  Yeah, the last six weeks. I wanted this to be a moment you will never forget.  So? Would you care to join me in our first dance as husband and wife?  I don’t know, it’s these new shoes, they’re all slippery.  Not well.  Thank you.  Bravo Dennis thanks for pleasing my mother so.  What size shoes do you wear?  Great, because my shoes are giving me a little problem on the dance floor, can I borrow the boots from your costume?  And the world will never know.  Yes, I told him how talented you were. I told him all about Days Of Our Lives.  But you’re not just a soap actor. You are a soap actor with freakishly tiny feet.  Did it turn into sand?  Why?  Wait a minute, wait. You’re telling me this actress person is the only woman you ever wanted who didn’t want you back?!  My Grandmother used to say that exact same thing to me.  Hey.  Yes, I realise that.  Thanks, it’s ah, Gaelic, for ‘Thy turkey’s done.’ So ah, I’m gonna go, nice, nice meeting you.  Hello.  Oh, I\\'m glad you guys are past that little awkward phase.  Oh-ho, liked what she saw, huh? Dug my action, did she? Checkin’ out the Chan-Chan man!  Yeah, she seemed cool, attractive. I’ll do it.  Well, the movie was great, dinner was great, and there’s nothing like a cool, crisp New York evening.  Of course, I didn’t get to enjoy any of that, because Joanna’s such a big, dull dud!  That’s what you say at the end of a date.  To her face? Look it’s the end of the date, I’m standing there, I know all she’s waiting for is for me to say ‘I’ll call her’ and it’s just y\\'know, comes out. I can’t help it, it’s a compulsion.  Multiple, so many paper cuts.  Look, you can’t call somebody after this long just to say, ‘In case you didn’t notice, I don’t like you!’  Nooo!! She’s really dull! And she gets this gross mascara goop thing in the corner of her eye!  All right! Fine! But it’s just a lunch date, no more than an hour! And from now on I get my own dates, I don’t want you setting me up with anybody ever again!  That’s just a lot of big talk, y\\'know.  The food there was, was great.  So take care.  Noo!  Look, I’m sorry. Okay? I’m weak, and pathetic, and sorry.  Ahhhh—I’m not going to call you.  Yeah, o-okay.  Well this is great! I’ll give you a call! We should do it again sometime!  Hey Eddie. Daahh!! What\\'re you doin\\' here?  Why?  I can\\'t sleep now.  No, look, that\\'s it, it\\'s over, I want you out, I want you out of the apartment now.  Hannibal Lecter...better roommate than you.  I didn\\'t realize that.  GET OUT NOW!!  Yes please.  I want you out.  Where did you hear it from before?  Ahhhh-gaaaahhh. Eddie what\\'re you still doin\\' here?  Look Eddie, aren\\'t you forgetting anything?  Maybe \\'cause the last one was made by Pepperidge Farm. Look Eddie, isn\\'t there something else you\\'re supposed to be doing right now?  Look you have to help me out here. I thought we had a deal. I thought by the time...  Your last roommate\\'s kidney?  Daaahhhh!  Why must everybody watch me sleep? There\\'ll be no more watching me sleep, no more watching.  Uuuh.  Get out. Get out, get out, get out, get out, get out, get out.  You, move out. Take your fruit, your stupid small fruit and GET OUT!  Uh-huh.  This is not out of the blue, this is smack dab in the middle of the blue.  You want some help.  Yes, yes I actually saw him leave. I mean that guy is standing in the window holding a human head. He is STANDING IN THE WINDOW HOLDING A HUMAN HEAD!  Our next cocktail party?  Eddie, do you remember yesterday?  Do you remember talking to me yesterday?  So what happened?  Oh sweet Moses.  May I help you?  Yeah, he\\'s lived here for years, I don\\'t, I don\\'t know what you\\'re talking about man.  Well I, I think we\\'d remember something like that.  Absolutely.  Ah that\\'s a cantelope.  Hey look, are we gonna have to bring this out every time Ross comes over?  I\\'m gonna hold him a different way. Look I don\\'t understand, if you hated it so much, why did you buy it in the first place?  So is he housetrained or is he gonna leave little bathroom tiles all over the place? Stay. Good, STAY! Good fake dog.  Dehydrated Japanese noodles under fluorescent lights... does it get better than this?  Ah, y\\'see, perfect might be a problem. Had you said \\'co-dependent\\', or \\'self-destructive\\'...  Yes please.  He\\'s a he?  ...Couldn\\'t enjoy a cup of noodles after that. I mean, is that ridiculous? Can you believe she actually thought that?  You did?  Huh. Did, uh... any of the rest of you guys think that when you first met me?  You\\'re kidding! Did you tell her I wasn\\'t?  Well, this is fascinating. So, uh, what is it about me?  Ross is smart and funny, d\\'you ever think that about him?  WHAT IS IT?!  Oh, oh, a quality, good, because I was worried you guys were gonna be vague about this.  I just have to know, okay. Is it my hair?  Hey, gorgeous.  No, nono, don\\'t- don\\'t worry about it. Believe me, apparently other people have made the same mistake.  So, uh... what do you think it is about me?  ...Quality, right, great.  Lowell? Financial Services\\' Lowell, that\\'s who you saw me with?  Well, yeah... \\'s\\'no Brian in Payroll.  No! Uh, I d\\'know! The point is, if you were gonna set me up with someone, I\\'d like to think you\\'d set me up with someone like him.  Excuse me? You don\\'t think I could get a Brian? Because I could get a Brian. Believe you me. ...I\\'m really not.  Well, don\\'t we look nice all dressed up?...It\\'s stuff like that, isn\\'t it?  Nothing, just your overcoat sounds remarkably like Brent Mussberger.  You\\'re watching a football game at a funeral?  You are a frightening, frightening man.  Oh, no-  Hi, I\\'m Chandler, and I have no idea who Dorothy is.  Hey.  Who are those people?  Hey, Lowell.  So how\\'s it going there in Financial Services?  Good, good. Listen, heh, I dunno what Shelley told you about me, but, uh... I\\'m not.  Really.  So- you can tell?  So you don\\'t think I have a, a quality?  He is?  Or... Dick.  Was it like a sneeze only better?  No!!  No, it\\'s... fancier than a pimple. Look Ross, why don\\'t you just go see a…  Okay, well, it\\'s definite, two more weeks of winter.  Hey!  Well, y\\'know if Joey and I played with matches we could get you up to an even hundred.  You\\'re right, I know.  Y\\'know what? You should go to my guy, because when I went in there with my third nipple. He just lopped it right off. Y\\'know? So I guess I\\'m lucky. I mean not as lucky as people who were born with two nipples.  Well, if he\\'s gonna break up with you, maybe Joey and I should water his plants. If y\\'know what I mean.  Well sensitive is important, pick him.  So, what do you thing the good news is?  Yes, but this is Pete. Okay? He’s not like other people, on your first date he took you to Rome. For most guys that’s like a third or fourth date kinda thing.  Oh, so you’re going with the teacher, huh?  Honey, you\\'re screaming.  Hey!  Yeah, he came up...  Monica says that her Maitre D. is the funniest guy she\\'s ever met.  Yes! Am I crazy to be this upset?  Yeah!  Hey!  What are you guys talking about?  Oh yeah? Is he funnier than me?  I do limericks... uhm... There once was a man named Chandler, whose wife made him die inside.  Well, I\\'m off to Tulsa, so if your Maitre D. friend has any funny Oklahoma jokes, tell him to e-mail me at www.hahanotsomuch.com.  Really...? See... that\\'s the thing: you gotta keep it smart, people!  That\\'s what\\'s weird? Joey, the man\\'s been captain of a cereal for the last 40 years.  Waaa-aaah.  The spoon. You licked and-and you put. You licked and you put.  Mine is the red one! Oh God. Can open, worms everywhere.  Because soap is soap. It\\'s self-cleaning.  Hey.  Excuse me, you guys are getting tattoos?  Wow, that\\'s lucky. What if her name was Big Ugly Splotch?  Oooh, Rich is goin\\' to the party too, huh?  I know, this is a great apartment.  Wow, there\\'s my fantasy come true. No, seriously.  Oh please, I saw the way you were checking out his mouldings. You want it.  Well it wouldn\\'t kill you to say it once in a while.  What?  Woah, woah, woah. I don\\'t need a roommate either, OK? I can afford to live here by myself. Ya know, I may have to bring in somebody once a week to lick the silverware.  Look, you know what? If this is the way you feel, then maybe you should take it.  Well then maybe you should take it.  Fine with me.  Hey.  Yeah me too.  Yeah. So do we need to hug here or. . .  Lick away my man.  What?  No-no, I mean what, what\\'s this about your new place?  Well, there you go.  Hey, no, I\\'ve never been lower or wetter. I\\'ll be fine. I\\'ll just turn your, uh, bedroom into a game room or somethin\\', you know, put the foosball table in there.  I did pay for half of it.  Alright I\\'ll tell you what, I\\'ll play you for it.  Your little men are gonna get scored on more times than your sister.  So, uhh, em, you want me to uh, give you a hand with the foosball table?  Thanks.  Yeah, right, yeah, I guess so.  Well, I\\'m guessing uh, tonight at the coffee house.  Yeah.  The British are coming?  Ohh.  Why?  Yes! Chandler Bing, 7! Chandler Bing, 0.  Okay, I\\'ll stop.  You wanna play?  Well, so, play for the next 30 minutes and then write until he gets home.  I\\'m intrigued.  Okay, but be careful okay, because I wanna get our security deposit back.  Do you even remember which part of the wall is not spackle?  Well, why can\\'t you do them tomorrow?  The only reason you\\'re doing this to Joey is because you\\'re bored. Okay, it\\'s not his fault that you\\'re unemployed.  Oh, so being a good friend means acting like a total jerk?  I paid for those tickets!  When did that happen to you?!  Oh yeah. First off all, chasing the Churo guy isn\\'t jogging.  I don\\'t believe they\\'re brother and sister.  Oh hey! There\\'s some kids playing in the street, you wanna go down there and give them a project, ruin their day?  Yeah or also when you don\\'t have somebody breathing down your neck ALL THE LIVE LONG DAY!!  What is up?  No, it was me. I\\'m sorry. I over reacted.  I am sorry, Ross.  This took you all day?!  See, now, why would you assume that? Just because we\\'re married? I will have you know that we are very hip, happening people. Now, if you\\'ll excuse me, I have to get back to reading the obituaries.  Wow.  Well, I think it\\'s great that you\\'re going on a date, you know? I mean, it sounds healthy. I mean, you have needs. Embrace your womanhood!  Emma? Emma? Look at me! Well, I think I\\'ll go downstairs for a while.  No, no, no, no! No, no, no, no! It\\'s okay, it\\'s okay. I didn\\'t go. Don\\'t cry, it\\'s just a bit! I\\'m your uncle Chandler; funny is all I have!  I don\\'t do that.  I\\'ll try to stop. Wait, did you say until the sixth?  Today is the sixth.  Yes, it\\'s also 2003.  It\\'s okay. Go take the test and see if we\\'re okay.  Tough crib.  I might have checked to see if I was ovulating a couple times.  I am not working. There\\'s not much to do around here!  Oh, good, because as of four o\\'clock this afternoon, I am not.  I - I don\\'t think I can.  Because of Emma.  Sorry.  Well, she\\'s aware when we leave the room. She may notice if we start... canoodling in it.  Well, I can\\'t say \"hump\" or \"screw\" in front of the B-A-B-Y.  Horrifying? Scarring? Something people go to jail for?  You guess I\\'m right? When we stayed at that bed and breakfast, you wouldn\\'t have sex with me because you thought a deer was staring through the window.  Emma was doing it!  Ooh, she\\'s asleep, that means we can...  I think we may have really done it this time.  You may wanna get some more of those too.  Where\\'s Emma?  Don\\'t ask me, I was in there canoodling you!  All right, all right, we were. We were trying to make a baby. Monica\\'s ovulating.  No, no, no.  What? Why?  Your family name is Tribbiani.  I could fall asleep at a play.  Hey!  Yes, but, Ross you chose a career of talking about dinosaurs.  Where the hell is everybody?  I... I don\\'t know... you seem lovely.  Well you should be. You missed the most powerful three hours in the history of the theater.  Oh yeah, I had no idea the amazing journey you go through as a woman! Tell me, tell me about your first period!  Did somebody sign your bra?  Oh well, this was a really important experience for me, and I wanted to share it with you.  Hey!  You look great. I\\'m so glad we\\'re having this rehearsal dinner, you know, I so rarely get to practice my meals before I eat them.  No stupid jokes. I thought that was for the actual wedding.  Heh.  Thank you.  I know, I hate being left out of things.  Fine. We\\'re just sitting here. Alone. Doing nothing. It\\'s our rehearsal for tomorrow.  What happened?  Pick me, I look great in a tux and I will not steal focus.  Oh, I will. But I will need a mirror... as he is me!  You are going downer!  Mike didn\\'t tell you? You have to chose one of us to be in your wedding. One of his groomsmen fell out.  Just not enough to put us in the original wedding party.  Hey, can I talk to you about this groomsman thing? If you pick Ross, he\\'ll walk you down the isle just fine. But if you choose me, you\\'ll be getting some comedy!  How\\'s it going?  You too.  Me too.  I\\'m not supposed to tell you.  Rach, Rach, knock knock.  I\\'ll tell you at the wedding.  So technically, would this person be in the wedding?  Ready?  Okay.  Wow! Aren\\'t you gonna be cold?  You look beautiful.  That really was an incredible wedding.  I\\'d love to, but it\\'s 2300 hours and I\\'m about to have the most organized sex anyone\\'s ever had.  I don\\'t know. Maybe he hooked up with that hot girl he was talking to.  Tell me what?  Wow!  More importantly, was I any good?  You\\'re okay there?  I\\'m sorry, it was a one-time-thing. I was very drunk and i was somebody else\\'s subconscious.  Hello Rachel.  Pirates again?  Well, you know Phoebs. I don\\'t know if it\\'s your kinda thing, because it involves a lot of being normal. For a large portion of the day.  A cool phone number, and a possible name for the kid.  When we were?  Whoa! And this manchild has no problem with how old you are?  Can you hear that?  See that\\'ll stop when you pick up the phone.  I\\'m not in a meeting. I\\'m right... Whoops.  What?  Ah!  Well, now, I actually have to get to work.  Okay.  Bye bye.  Why not?  What?!  Noho. Who doesn\\'t they like me?  What are you talking about?  I can\\'t belive it.  They do me?  I don\\'t sound like that.  Okay, I don\\'t sound like that. That is so not true.  That is so not... That is so not... That... Oh, shut up!  Oh, come on. You told me about the last dream.  Oh, why not. Was I doing anything particularly... saucy?  And this has nothing to do with the fact that he needs a note to get out of gym.  Tyrannosaurus!  Work people? Nobody told me.  You know, I don\\'t get this. A month ago, these people were my friends. You know, just because I\\'m in charge doesn\\'t mean I\\'m a different person.  You think I should?  Okay.  Okay.  I Think last night was great. You know, the Karaoke thing. Tracy and I doing Ebony and Ivory.  What?  Then, I don\\'t get it.  They do?  I just wan\\'t to...  But I just wa...  Thanks. Listen, about the weekly numbers, I\\'m gonna need them on my desk by nine o\\'clock.  You have to give \\'em something, you know. Okay, now that was Gerston, Santos, and who\\'s the guy with the moustache?  Petrie, right, right. Okay, some people gonna be working this weekend.  Yeah, like in a cab...  Okay, hating this.  Here we go, here we go.  Hey-hey-hey. So what happened? A forest tick you off?  Yeah!  You’re building a post office?  Does anyone else think David Copperfield is cute?  All right, Janice, likes him. In fact she likes him so much she put him on her freebie list.  Well, we have a deal, where we each get to pick five celebrities that we can sleep with, and the other one can’t get mad.  Ah, Kim Basinger, Cindy Crawford, Halle Berry, Yasmine Bleeth, and ah, Jessica Rabbit.  I know, I know, I just always wondered if I could get her eyes to pop out of her head.  Peter Parker.  Hi.  We don’t, really.  You know, we don’t really take advantage of living in the city.  No, you didn’t get me!! It’s an electric drill, you get me, you kill me!!  I do NOT want this unit!!  All right, so who do you got it narrowed down to?  Oooh-hoo, very attractive, forgiving.  Eh, y\\'know what, she’s to political, she probably wouldn’t let you do it, unless you donated four cans of food first.  Ooh-hoo. Very hot, very sexy. But ah, y\\'know she’s too international, y\\'know she’s never gonna be around.  So, you gotta play the odds, pick somebody who’s gonna be in the country like all the time.  What’s going on?  Yo!! Spackel boy! Get up!  He started mine first!  What, like a number?  Okay, on three. One....Two....  Why two?  Yeah, I coulda counted to three like four times without all this ‘two’ talk.  Okay, one...two...  Oh, good job Joe.  Yeah-yeah, so big that it actually makes our doors look smaller!  Umm?  I’ve got five bucks says you can’t.  Oh, I think I have the cash.  Hey.  Yeah, we were gonna give fifty, but if you guys gave more, we don\\'t wanna look bad.  And twenty-five it is.  Phoebs, let me ask you something, were, were these, uh, funny brownies?  Which is why geese are so relaxed this time of year.  What\\'s in the bag?  Nah, Phoebs, that\\'s the guy that comes in the frame.  Ya know I remember my father, all dressed up in the red suit, the big black boots, and the patent leather belt, sneakin around downstairs. He didn\\'t want anybody to see him but he\\'d be drunk so he\\'d stumble, crash into something and wake everybody up.  Who said anything about Christmas?  So whaddya got there Monica?  Don\\'t you have to be Claymation to say stuff like that?  Yeah, she, she brought the invisible cab. . . hop in.  Hey, don\\'t worry. I figure it\\'ll be 2 hours to Phoebe\\'s dad\\'s house, they\\'ll meet, they\\'ll chat, they\\'ll swap life stories, we\\'ll still have plenty of time.  Hey.  Eeeshk.  OK.  Oh, so that\\'s what this is for.  Yeah.  Alright.  Alright, we\\'re gettin\\' closer.  Well, so why not go knock?  Yeah, and someday when you\\'re ready, you\\'ll make it past the hedges.  Oh, that\\'s OK, we\\'ll figure something out.  Ho, ho, ho, holy crap is it hot in here!  OK, Phoebs, your turn.  And, a lemon lime.  And last but not least.  Yep.� That\\'s a lot of cats Jo Lynn.� Single are ya?  Chandler Bing.  What\\'s up Joe?  Braid each other\\'s hair and ride horseback on the beach?  Courtside?� Oh my God.  That\\'s so cool.� I\\'ll let Monica know.  Joey just called.� He\\'s got courtside Knicks tickets for him and me tomorrow night.  I know.� You\\'re right.� I want to see you too.� I\\'ve just got to figure out a way to tell Joey, you know?� He\\'s really looking forward to this.  Yeah, ah, ah . . .� I\\'ll think of something.  Hey.  Well, it looks great.� It\\'s just that . . . well, I\\'m wearing the same thing underneath.� So . . .  Because I didn\\'t know how to tell him that I couldn\\'t go to the Knicks game.� So, I just told him that I had to stay in Tulsa.  Yah.  What? Why?  Look I, I can\\'t.� What\\'s going on?  NO!  No! Wait!  Is that really necessary?  All right.� I\\'ve got a plan.� I\\'ll go down the fire escape.  Hear me out woman.� I\\'ll go down the fire escape.� Then, I\\'ll wait for a while.� Then, when I come up the stairs, it\\'ll be just like I just got back from Tulsa.� Then, Joey and I will come in and see that there\\'s no guy in here.  I\\'m just going to wait for a little while.  It\\'s huge.  That\\'s right.� You\\'re husband\\'s home.� So, now the sex can stop.  Joey said that you\\'re in here with another man.  All right.� Well, I\\'ll check the guest room.  There\\'s nobody here Joe.  I\\'m sorry.� I, I told you I was in Tulsa because I wanted to spend the night with Monica and I, I didn\\'t know . . .� I didn\\'t think you\\'d understand.  Yeah.� I feel so bad.� Is there anything I can do to make it up to you?  I\\'m sorry. �That\\'s the one thing I can\\'t do.� I promised I\\'d be with Monica.  What?  Really?� You\\'re gonna be okay?  You\\'re gonna put on sweats and clean, aren\\'t you?  Okay, bye.  Hey, listen.� I\\'m never going to lie to you again, okay?� And I want you to know that nobody thinks you\\'re stupid.  Game\\'s tomorrow night Joe.  Okay.  Hiya doin\\' pumpkin?  So, what are you gonna do?  Me?! Why me?  I\\'ll try, but I\\'m not sure what good it would do, y\\'know? Because I\\'m a lot less afraid of commitment than I used to be.  Gary, I\\'m here to report a crime.  It is a crime that you and I don\\'t spend more time together.  Well, I heard that you thinking about asking Phoebe to move in with you and I thought maybe, we should have a talk. Man to uh, me.  Uh, are you crazy? Are you insane? If you live with Phoebe, you two are gonna be y\\'know, live-living together!  You mean scared.  Scared? Happy?  I am trying to open your eyes, my man! Don\\'t you see, if you lived with Phoebe she\\'s always gonna be there. You\\'re gonna get home, she\\'s there. You go to bed, she\\'s there. You wake up and oh yes, she\\'s there!  Were you\\'re parents happy, or something?  Wow, y\\'know when you say it, it doesn\\'t sound so scary.  Yeah, I think I do! Y\\'know what? You move in with her! You move in with her right now! Maybe I should in with Monica!  Hi!  Yes I did, and I think you should do it.  He\\'s a great guy, y\\'know? And he loves you a lot, you are a very lucky lady.  Hey Gar!  Four hours? You guys have been doing this for four hours?  What?  I\\'m not a dropper!  It\\'s throwing and catching!  Maybe that\\'s because she\\'s a minion of the anti-Christ.  Yeah, you almost overreacted to something.  Not fun anymore?  Come on! Gary\\'s such a great guy! Whatever the problem is, you can work it out!  Oh that is over!  You guys wanna eat here?  Oh yes.  Hi there!  That.  Hey Rach, now that you\\'re working at Ralph Lauren, can you bring me back some of those polo shirts?  Unwilling to steal from work, interesting.  Dude! That\\'s my girlfriend!  Yeah, it is the best.  Yeah, or you can do the easy thing and smoke.  Yeah, I wanna go to babe.  Ah sure. What\\'s in \\'em?  Oh good, because uh we got Rachel 800 gallons of water.  Y\\'know I rued the day once…didn\\'t get a whole lot else done.  Okay, there\\'s something different though--Oh my God! You smoked!  Yes you did! You look happy and sick; you smoked!  I wish I had smoked for my career…  Okay, but you gotta push past this because it is about to get so good!  Great job with the cups, Pheebs!  Awesome!  Okay, great.  Our eyes are closed and we’re about to cross the street. Very good.  No-no, I don’t think you heard me. Are you ready to party?!  Kathy’s with her parents, I have nothing to do, so tomorrow we are partying with Gandolf dude!  I’m gonna call and get off work tomorrow!  This is gonna be soo cool, dude, we never party anymore!  Oh man! I am so excited—I may vomit!  Look you don’t understand, Gandolf is amazing. Y’know you’re never know what’s gonna end up happening, you go out for a couple of beers and end up on a fishing boat to Nova Scotia!  Oh yeah, it’s beautiful country up there.  It’s not gonna be exactly like last time.  Whoa-wh-wh-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa!  He’s not gonna make it, he’s stuck in Chicago.  Stupid, useless Canadian money!  Yeah, and I-I gave first names to all of the foosball players.  Oh-no, y’know with Gandolf we’d be out all night!  And may-maybe we could end up on a boat again?  All right!!  Remember that really cold morning, you woke up and those dogs were licking your face?  Well, those were seals, man.  Yeah, all right.  Actually, me too.  Actually, can I get some hot water with a little lemon? I think I strained my voice screaming in there. Does it have to be so loud?  Y’know what? We’re not sad, we’re not sad, we’re just not 21 anymore. Y’know? I’m 29 years old, damnit! And I want to sit in a comfortable chair, and watch television and go to bed at a reasonable hour!  Is that gal pal spelled L-O-S-E-R?  Nice work my friend.  And a bagel with only…  Well, I see you\\'ve had a very productive day. Don\\'t you think the cowboy hat is a little much?  Y’know what, we have to turn off the porn.  All right, ready?  Two.  Yeah, that’s kinda a relief.  You wanna see if we still have it?  FREE PORN!!!  We have free porn here!!!  What’s wrong with you?  This sounds like a hernia. You have to—you-you—Go to the doctor!  That’s still in there?!  Stick to your side!  Mento?  Thanks.  Well this one\\'s for you.  That\\'s what they\\'ll call us.  It hurts me. It physically hurts me.  You’re turning into a woman.  Now I’ve upset you? What did I say?  Oh my God, introduce us!  Aren\\'t you supposed to be at an audition for another hour?  Sorry.  Hello!  Okay, but don\\'t you think this is a little extreme?  Yeah I know, we\\'re losing Ross, Joey said hence…  You\\'re on in 5 Ms. Minnelli.  So you\\'re really okay with this?  Now that\\'s so funny, because last Christmas I got the gift of space. We should get them together and make a continuum.  Okay, what is in here? Rocks?  So, rocks.  Look, we just think that maybe she\\'s being a little unreasonable.  Kind of? If you just kept this to yourself none of this would\\'ve happened.  Well, I think it\\'s very brave what you said.  Pheebs, what are you doing with the coat? How about the whole animal rights thing?  Uh, Ross?  Yeah, we are so sorry.  Hi!  Oh yeah, there-there she is!  Oh my goodness! Where did you hide it?  Pheebs you didn’t have to get us anything for our wedding you already sang…  Oh, okay.  I kinda like it here.  Well what did it do?  A vending machine?  Who cares? It’s a stupid game.  I don’t suck. It’s sucks. You suck.  Why do you want to play this game so bad?  You are not going to believe what I did today!  Well I’ve been playing it for like eight hours, it’ll loosen up. Come on, check out the scores. Oh, and also look at the initials, they’re dirty words.  Because it’s awesome.  Well y’know, they only give you three letters, so after A-S-S it is a bit of a challenge.  It is when you put it together with that one.  Come on, he won’t even know what they mean.  Have you talked to him lately?  With the claw?!  All right! Go left! Go left! Go right!! Go right!!  Hey.  I’m so sorry.  I have a job interview I have to get ready for.  And people say you don’t pay attention. No, this is a much better job. It’s vice-president of a company that does data reconfiguration and statistical factoring for other companies.  That’s what I do now.  The front page? You really do live in your own little world, don’t ya?  Well, I got a job interview. It’s kinda a big deal too. Its a lot more money and I’d be doing data reconfiguration and statistical factoring.  Me! I do that. So… Seriously, do I look okay? I’m little nervous.  Why not?  What about it?  Are you serious?!  What is it that I do?  I can’t even believe this! I really come off that badly?  Oh good. Good, because I’m sure this interview is gonna last a couple of weeks.  An hour.  Phoebe!  Chandler Bing.  …I think you’ll find if I come to work here, I don’t micro-manage. I don’t shy away from delegating.  Hardest thing I’ve ever done in my life.  Really?  Okay.  …also I was the point person on my company’s transition from the KL-5 to GR-6 system.  That I did. That I did.  No don’t I beg of you!  Oh my God this doesn’t count! Okay? The interview was over, that was the real Chandler Bing in there, this is just some crazy guy out in the hall! Call security! There’s a crazy guy out in the hall!  Yeah, I don\\'t know why we hang out with married couples more often.  A dinosaur died a million years ago?  YOU NEVER DID IT!  Hey! I will have you know that... aah, who am I kidding. Let\\'s call the kid Geller and let Bing die with me.  Mrs Hannigan?  Hey Joe! We\\'ve got a couple of things we\\'ve got to check out at the new house. You want to come with us?  Yeah, come with us. You\\'ll see how close it is to the city.  Damn it.  That\\'s what we were gonna name the baby.  Hey, how\\'d the interview go?  You know, I always feel that way after an interview. I\\'ll bet it went better than you think.  That is a bad interview.  Ooh! Israeli champagne. And it\\'s vanilla!  To Ross!  And thank you for explaining to us what escrow means... I\\'ve already forgotten what you said, but thank you.  What?  When your head was hanging out the window, it didn\\'t hit a mailbox, did it?  Man, those two dogs are going at it!  Hey.  Really? What changed your mind?  Joey, there was a little girl who lived here, but she died like 30 years ago.  Ha! I\\'m just messing with you.  You don\\'t think we\\'d buy a house and not have a Joey room do you?  Excuse me?  For your information, I was staring at her baby. We\\'re about to be parents.  How did the job stuff go?  That\\'s great!  …betrothed couple.  Hey!  Pheebs?  Skull?  How long have we been home?  Lovely!  Hey, you know what I was thinking? When we get married, are you gonna change your last name to Bing?  Why not?  Hey!  Ohh! You guys gonna be living together again?  Well, she\\'s just so much fun with Joey, I just assumed, she\\'d still be living with him.  No reason, except…she…told…me.  No! No, she didn\\'t say that. I-I-I think you should talk to Monica now.  Bing doesn\\'t seem so weird now, does it?  Forty-five minutes? We have tickets to the Musicman at 8:00.  Is this because of the burrito thing?  Give him money? It was a joke!  Right, calm down, O\\'Mally. I\\'ll slip him some money.  How do you know so much about this?  Richard used to do it, didn\\'t he?  Mustached bastard…  Hey Pheebs!  If you wanna give Joey a Christmas present that disrupts the entire building, why not get him something a little bit more subtle, like a wrecking ball, or a vile of small pox to release in the hallway?  Well, I\\'m here to see my old buddy Ben. What are you doing here, weird…turtle-man?  What?  You called everyone and said you were having trouble finding a Santa costume, so I borrowed one from a guy at work!  Why?  But I didn\\'t get to shape my belly like a bowl full of jelly.  Fine, I\\'ll give the suit back.  Santa? Really?  Did your Dad ever dress up like Santa?  Well, I\\'ll stay, but only because I wanna hear about Hanukkah. Ben, will you sit here with Santa and learn about Hanukkah?  Oh yeah, but don\\'t worry. I don\\'t think anybody\\'s gonna focus on that as long as your wearing that towel dress.  All right, I suppose I can wait a day. Hey, what are you doing Friday?  I need you to come to this bachelor party for my weird cousin Albert, y\\'know he\\'s the botanist.  Yeah. Is that a dinosaur tie?  Well apparently Albert has no friends. He\\'s very excited about the bachelor party though. I think actually the only reason he\\'s getting married is so he can see a stripper.  Well, if the magician can open my beer with his but cheeks, then all right.  I want to say you but, that seems like such an easy answer.  I\\'ll get you the Cliff Notes.  The abridgment.  ....three years of modern dance with Twila Tharp! Five years with the American Ballet Theater?!  Oh no, no, no, no.  Okay, we have our stripper. A miss Crystal Chandelier.  Bye-bye.  What, what, what?!  You really think that is what he meant?  Look, don\\'t you see what\\'s happening here. Instead of hitting on her right away, he\\'s becoming her confidant. Now he\\'s gonna be the guy she goes too to complain about you.  Well, why don\\'t you send her a musical bug, op, no you already did that. All right look, you\\'re going to have to go there yourself now, okay, make a few surprise visits.  All right fine, don\\'t do anything, just sit here and talk to us, meanwhile she is talking to him about you. And he\\'s being Mr. Joe Sensitive, and she starts thinking \\'Maybe this is the guy for me, because he understands me.\\'  He paints quite a picture doesn\\'t he?  Y\\'know what, I\\'m, I\\'m gonna spend some alone time with the pen.  Oh, okay Ross. Listen, this pen is kinda getting boring, so can you pick me up some porn?  Yeah. Either that, or you just turned him on and sent him off to a stripper.  Oh no-no-no, I’m, I’m paddling away!  Wow! Really?! We get all this rusty crap for free?!  Could we be more white trash?  Hey uh, Rach, funny story. I ah, bumped into Joanna on the street yesterday.  Well, no, actually she uh, asked me if I wanted to get a drink.  Well, not at first.  Well, I think I judged her too quickly, and this time we were able to take the relationship to the next level.  Oh, come on! It’s not like this is an everyday occurrence for me! I mean usually I’m pretty much just in there by myself.  Okay, I promise, I’ll end it.  I hope you know what I’m giving up for ya, because she’s not just the boss in your office, if you know what I mean.  It just doesn’t…feel like we’re breaking up.  Okay.  Thanks.  I’m getting dressed.  When I walk outside naked people throw garbage at me.  What is it?  You are, you’re gonna leave me like this?  How little?!  Look, this isn’t funny! You get back here right now!  Why not?!  What?!  Okay, here’s the situation. The keys to the cuffs are on the back of the door. Could you be a doll and grab them and scoot on over and unlock me? And on a totally different subject, that is a lovely pantsuit.  I did break up with her! She just took it really, really well!  It did enter my mind! But then something happened that made it, shoot right out.  Never!  Fine!  I—never borrowed your Walkman.  About what?  I’ll make something up! I’m good at lying, I actually did borrow your Walkman!  Oh-ho-ho, I don’t think so!  Well, this is much better.  Hey, look, you’re in trouble either way! Okay? If she comes back and sees me locked to this instead of the chair, she’s gonna know you were in here. So you might as well just let me go.  Freedom!  No!  With extra pulp?  No!  You don’t have it.  How do Monica and Phoebe know?  And Milton Berle has a…  I think so.  Could there be more Kims?  Oh, I\\'m going on the lamb.  Well, I think, I think Ross knows about me and Monica.  Look, we\\'re not just messing around! I love her. Okay, I\\'m in love with her.  Yeah, big zero gravity moon steps.  Hey listen, come on, Joey is having a problem! A little girl is beating him up.  Very, very funny, but don\\'t say things like that in front of Monica. I don\\'t want you putting any ideas in her head.  Wh-wh-why?!  Yeah, so, what\\'s that supposed to mean?!  I don\\'t see it that way. Okay? Because, I see two Monicas, the one that was my friend, who lived across the hall, and wanted to have a lot of babies and then the new Monica, who I just started to date. Now, who\\'s to say what she wants?! I’m right. I\\'m right. Am I right?  Okay. It\\'s not different at all, is it?  Hmm.  Yeah, I\\'m cool. Casual.  I\\'m just hanging out. Y\\'know, having fun. Y\\'know with the girl that I\\'m seeing casually.  What?!  Well, you do want all that stuff, right?  Yes! You want babies! You have baby fever!  Oh please, you are obsessed with babies and-and marriage and everything that\\'s related to babies and-and marriage! I\\'ve got an idea, why don\\'t we turn down the heat on this pressure cooker?!  Nah-uh! I know you! Okay? I know the thoughts that you have in the head--in your head!  Well, I did not know that.  It\\'s gonna be okay, right? I mean she\\'s not gonna leave me? This is, this is fixable.  By me?  Just tell me what I need to do to make things right.  Well, that\\'s what we do. Y\\'know, I-I mess up and then you tell me how to fix it and then I do and then y\\'know you think I\\'m all cute again.  Where\\'s Monica?! Where is she? I need to talk to her! It\\'s urgent! Is she here?  I need to talk to you, it\\'s urgent!  Will you marry me?  I don\\'t know. But I know I\\'m not afraid to do this.  I\\'m doing this because I\\'m sorry?  Yeah, I\\'m kinda wishing everyone wasn\\'t here right now.  I didn\\'t think I was!  Okay, how long is this going to go on.  That\\'s not funny.  That\\'s funny, we were doing the same thing!  Yeah it is really pricey. I mean, I freaked when I first heard the numbers.  It was pretty simple actually, I came up with a couple of cost-cutting solutions, wrote out a list and Monica told me to go to hell.  Hey!  Our adoption social worker is coming by today so we are cleaning the apartment.  You know you don\\'t want me to help. You can\\'t have it both ways!  Kind of. She\\'s coming by to interview us and see where we live.  What...? NO!  I\\'ll admit to the cigarettes and the magazine, but that tape is not mine.  Ok, ok, here we go.  But you already gave all your money to charity!  I don’t think you can do that!  That’s sweet, honey, but save something for the adoption Lady.  Oh, because we love kids. Love ‘em to death.Well, not actually to death, that\\'s just a figure of speech - we love kids the appropriate amount... as allowed by law.  But other than that... wholesome, wholesome building.  What?  Of course it was!  RAT BASTARD!  Oh, it\\'s just some crazy guy who roams the halls here. He\\'s great with  Oh, just like I said. That crazy... Bert... roaming the halls. (Joey bangs on  WE\\'LL TALK TO YOU LATER, BERT. EVERYTHNG\\'S FINE!!  Oh yeah! He has a caretaker. His older brother... Ernie.  What the hell are you doing?  Well, we\\'re not.  We don\\'t have a code word.  Ok!  What?  I can explain... Joey...  Oh, that\\'s really ok.  Wrong number?  That\\'s great!  Hello...? Have you seen Joey\\'s bat?  That is lucky.  Now-now, why would you say that Joseph?   Oh, ok.  Oh no, it\\'s terrific, it\\'s- it\\'s- y\\'know, you deserve this, after all your years of struggling, you\\'ve finally been able to crack your way into show business.  Oh, are we playing this?!  Hey! How’d the audition go?  So it did go well.  Oh that’s great!  Oh my God!  Oh-oh, what are you doing?  Well, it is overdue.  Yeah okay, I was just talking to the guys. Just look at them I mean, is it okay if they come visit?  As crazy as soccer?  You mean you didn’t get it from this?  Well, maybe we can fix it y’know? Maybe we can send him some-some big-big flowers and scare him!  I messed up. Okay? I’m sorry, I really messed up.  Which I bought for ya. Taught ya how to use it. You thought it was a copier. Look, if there was anything I could do, I would do it. Okay? But everybody’s allowed one mistake, right?   You know he coulda gotten me a VCR, he coulda gotten me a set of golf clubs, but no, he has to get me the woman repeller!  The eyesore from the Liberace house of crap!   Yeah, I mean when you were late last night, Kathy and I got to talking, and one thing to another and…   No! No! No! I just kissed her.   How is that worse?!   You’re right, I have no excuses! I was totally over the line.  Look, I’m not saying that you should magically forgive me! But you’re not perfect! You’ve made some errors in judgment too!   What the hell happened?!! How were you locked in?!! And where the hell is all of our stuff?!!   So--You got in voluntarily?!   BEND OVER?!!!  Ok, now, remember, no trading. You get the pretty one, I get the mess.  ...And what did you bring?  Janice?  Janice?!  Joey\\'s tailor...took advantage of me.  Oh come on!  He said he was going to do my inseam, and he ran his hand up my leg, and then, there was definite...  Cupping.  I can’t believe I did this! What an idiot!  Do you think he’ll ever forgive me?  Y’know what? I-I kinda have.  You didn’t see how mad he was, y’know?  Oh my God!  Please tell me you got the message!  The actor playing Mac couldn’t do it, they needed to see you at 2 o’clock.  Du-du-I wrote it, I wrote it on the board! I wrote it on the board, then I went all over New York City looking for ya! I went to Ross’s! I went to the coffeehouse! I went to any place that they made sandwiches!  Sorry! I-I-I don’t know what to say.  Y’know, sometimes that fake out thing is just mean!  Well that’s good. Because you didn’t! And I’m incredibly happy for ya!!  Oh, we could do this all day.  You are gonna be a huge star! I’m gonna hug ya!  All right!  I think so. Yeah, get off me.  Now wait a minute, I claimed you in the name of France four years ago.  Hey.  Listen, I\\'m, I\\'m sorry I didn\\'t make it over there today.  Yeah well, I hear the place looks great.  Oh hey, it\\'s, it\\'s terriffic. I mean it\\'s a regular space... fest.  Yeah I just... wanted to call and say hey.  That\\'s right my friend. It\\'s time for...  I still can\\'t believe they promoted her to lieutenant.  Well, how could anyone not be in love with Yasmine Blepe?  See, this is the brilliance of the show. I say always keep them running. All the time, running. Run. Run Yasmine, run like the wind.  But we had one of the greatest talks we ever had last night. I mean it was, it was like when we first started living together.  But...  So uhh, how\\'s the palace?  Oh, uhh, actually I uh, have some news.  Well, uh, why don\\'t you ask him yourself. Joey, this is my new roommate Eddie.  Well you know, we got to talking and uh, he said he needed a place and I had a spare room.  Well yeah, in that it\\'s not being used and I... have it to spare.  Hey Jo. When\\'d you start usin\\' mousse in your hair?  Morning.  Oh it\\'s uh, over there on the table.  No, Eddie likes to keep it over there.  Oh, ooh.  What?  Well I do, but uh, Eddie makes them this way and, well they\\'re pretty darn good.  Oh, I couldn\\'t be happier.  There\\'s another carton right over there.  Alright, so what\\'s it about?  Well I like both eggs equally.  Well what\\'s the difference? Your eggs aren\\'t here anymore, are they? You took your eggs and you left. You really expect me to never find new eggs?  Hey Eddie, you uh, wanna play some foosball?  You don\\'t like that show?  Well that\\'s the brilliance of it. The pretty people... and the running.  Oh o-, OK man.  Hey.  Y’know uh, I didn’t actually do this.  No, it wasn’t you.  I got a maid. Yay!  Uh honey, I know you don’t like to relinquish control…  Look, she’s really nice. Okay? And she mentioned that she adored the way that you arranged the sponges.  Yes, I distinctly remember ‘cause I thought it was a joke. Now just give her a chance, okay?  What’s the matter?  See? I told you.  So she stole your pants and then she came back and wore them in front of you?  She must’ve been planning this for years!  Honey, isn’t it possible that the company that sold the jeans made more than just the one pair?  So, shouldn’t we go give her the benefit of the doubt before we go…snooping around her crotch?  Out of curiosity, what is your secret ingredient?  How come?  To see her pants?  Are you sure? Did you see the stain?  God! She is not stealing from us! Okay, will you let this go?  Oh dear God!  And yet you don’t recognize that you’re crazy.  Here’s another plan…No!  Why?  I fear a jury will see it the same way!  You see that?  All right. Yes. Okay. I get your point. But if it’s not your bra will you just let the woman clean the apartment?!  You need new clothes.  I’m leaning. This is where I lean.  Brenda a bee!  Yes! It’s flown into your blouse and you’d better undo your buttons lest it sting you!  You do?  Thanks!  Joey, we would\\'ve asked you, we just thought you wouldn\\'t be interested.  So excited about your letter!  So you must be going to somewhere fancy to celebrate?  That\\'s where people make number two!!  On every word?  And that became ‘they are humid prepossessing Homo Sapiens with full sized aortic pumps...?  I doubt that! Tell her about us last year.  Word!  Oh, I don\\'t think it was desperate, I think it was amazing!  Sounds good to me... but what would a guy think?  Hey Joe! How\\'s the second draft of the letter coming?  Can we read it? Can you print out another copy?  They thought it was very smart of us to have a child write the recommendation letter.  She guessed 8, 9, based on his drawings.  That sounds like fun.  Like war. Or that thing in Joey\\'s refrigerator. Remember? It was in a milk carton but it looked like meat?  Hey! Monica can be cool and fun at organized indoor projects!  Hey!  Monica and I are celebrating our ten-month anniversary, we\\'ve got reservations at Ja George.  Made a few calls, pulled some strings, and they agreed to seat us at 11:30 if we both had the chicken and didn\\'t get desert.  Hey Caitlin! Somebody got a haircut.  Yeah, if that was true, gym class would\\'ve been a lot more interesting.  Oh, he\\'s in the back. The duck pissed him off, said that eggs came first.  Okay, bye!  What?  I was not flirting.  Okay first of all, the impression, uncanny. And second, that was not flirting, that was just casual conversation between two people. That is all.  I was not flirting.  I was not and oh God, shh!  Is that what this is about? You like Caitlin?  So, Joey on Law & Order, you must be very proud!  The one that doesn\\'t.  Hey, why don\\'t you wear those earrings I gave you?  Okay.  If you said, \"Big lima bean, bubbling up.\" Would she understand the difference?  You\\'re welcome.  What?  Really?!  Okay, but there is a big difference. You are a lot hotter than I am.  Yes, it does bother me! And I think it would bother a lot of people. Rachel, when you were going out with Ross, did it bother you when he flirted with other women?  Doesn\\'t know, \"Hello.\" But she knows Capricorn One.  So uh Monica, do you, do you like the Law & Order?  See, I\\'m finding out all this stuff about you today, like you like the Law & Order and that you flirted with every guy in the Tri-State area!  Oh, I\\'m so glad we cleared that up. Look, I\\'m sorry, some things are different for men and for women.  Okay, I\\'ve already taught you so much already, but whatever. See when you flirt with a guy you think, \"I\\'m just flirting, no big deal.\" But the guy is thinking, \"Finally! Somebody who wants to sleep with me!\"  It\\'s true.  Again true.  All guys that are awake. Then we go to sleep and then all the guys from the other end of the world wake up and behave the exact same way.  Oh the humanity.  More so than anything else.  Almost over man.  Why am I looking?  You couldn\\'t have at least changed your shirt.  You ready?  You look amazing. I\\'m the luckiest man in the world.  Let me see the earrings.  I can\\'t believe you would actually say that. I would much rather be Mr.Peanut than Mr.Salty.  I feel violated. And not in a good way.  I am telling you, years from now, schoolchildren will study it as one of the greatest first dates of all time. It was unbelievable! We could totally be ourselves, we didn\\'t have to play any games...  No, interestingly enough her leaf blower picked up.  Oh, no-no-no-no. Last time I left a spontaneous message I ended up using the phrase \"Yes indeedy-o.\"  Hey Rach!  Yes!  I have my reasons.  Hey, I\\'ve been honing!  Oh, uh.. I want her to think I might be in a restaurant.. y\\'know? I might have some kind of life, like I haven\\'t been sitting around here honing for the past few hours.  What are you looking at me for? I didn\\'t know that.  Can I use your phone?  Yes, it\\'s working! Why isn\\'t she calling me back?  Y\\'don\\'t think that makes me seem a little...  Ah, you obviously saw my personal ad.  She answered.  I\\'m not gonna talk to her, she obviously got my message and is choosing not to call me. Now I\\'m needy and snubbed. God, I miss just being needy.  If it helps, I could slide over.  Hello? Hello?  So how\\'s Mindy?  Hell is filled with people like you.  ...And boogie!  Okay, I\\'m gonna go to the bathroom. Will you watch my phone?  Hey, we haven\\'t been on a second date, she needs to hear me pee?  I can\\'t call her, I left a message! I have some pride.  \\'S\\'why I\\'m dancing...  Ring dammit, ring!  What?!  Nngghhh!!!!!!!  Danielle! Hi! Uh- everybody, this is Danielle, Danielle, everybody.  What are you doing here?  ...I\\'m, I\\'m okay.  That sounds good. I\\'ll call you- or you call me, whatever...  Okay.  ...I dunno.  Well, she seems very nice and everything, but that whole thing about her coming all the way down here, just to see if I was okay? I mean,... how needy is that?  Hey! Babe! Aren’t you excited we’re going on our honeymoon?  I’d better go pack.  Oh no-no Joey, I am not going to tell you because I am an excellent secret keeper.  You already know.  Oh honey, leave them alone, they’re in love.  We are on our honeymoon.  25J and K, any chance those aren’t together?  No.  Just act like you belong.  Oh that’s all right, I have it memorized. It’s 1A.  Oh you’ve got to be kidding me.  We’re you just ten seconds later!  What else is new?  Oh no-no-no-no-no-no, vomit tux! No-no, vomit tux!  Well y\\'know a lot of those Muppets don\\'t have thumbs.  Uhh, yeah. She uh, she uh, she uh might\\'ve mentioned him.  Yeah, I don\\'t think he\\'s up to meeting everyone yet.  Yes!  If you\\'re cooking on the stove, does that mean that your new secret boyfriend is better in bed than Richard?  Yes!  Well, you can\\'t just not see Rachel anymore, she\\'s one of your best friends.  That\\'s true!  That\\'s true!  Hey, there he is! There he is!  How many times have I told you guys, you never watch the cooking channel!  Hey!  Oh that was yours? Uh, yeah, we used it when the duck was throwing up caterpillars.  Well I just, thought maybe you\\'d wanna book some time with the best you\\'d ever had.  Why?  What\\'s your point?  I mean I was nothing before you. Call the other girls and ask. Which wouldn\\'t take long. But when I\\'m with you, and we\\'re together, OH…MY…GOD.  Oh-aw my God! Now, I understand if you never want to sleep with me again, but that would be wrong. We\\'re too good! We owe it, to sex!  Yeah, why don\\'t we lose the gloves.  All right, let\\'s show them how it\\'s done.  Y\\'know that wasn\\'t part of it?  Nope.  No, no, no, I don’t, I don’t really wanna play.  That’s not true! I wanted to wear my bathrobe and eat peanut clusters all day. I wanted to start drinking in the morning. Don’t say that I don’t have goals!  Yeah, all right, I’ll play.  No, no, no, you say that proudly.  And was the curse lifted?  But wait a minute though, how are we gonna get there, though, because my Mom won’t let me cross the street.  And then Tineals.  Wow! Just like in the pros.  Sorry. I’m sorry. Y\\'know what, we’re just gonna throw it.  No, no, no, actually losers rhyme.  Great! Now, the score is 7 to almost 7.  No, no, no, no, no!  Mar-haaaan.  Well, that went well.  Y\\'know, I was thinking about ah, asking her for her number.  Whoa-ho, whoa! No, I was thinking about y\\'know for me, as a part of that whole getting over Janice thing you were talking about.  Thanks. What, let me have her?! What do mean? Like if you didn’t I wouldn’t have a shot?  Math!! You’re giving me math! All right, look y\\'know what, forget about it, you go for the girl, we’ll see who gets her.  Well now you have two. Hey, I am good at math.  Hey! Well, I’ve been preparing for that my entire life! Or something about you that’s mean!  Before!!  Is everybody else seeing a troll doll nailed to a two by four?  Okay, good.  No-no-no-no, the game’s not over, we’re just switching teams.  No ah, hold on a second Joe, where do Dutch people come from?  And the other ah, Dutch people, they come on from somewhere near the Netherlands, right?  Fine with me.  Yes!!  Well, you don’t you have Captain Hook explain it to her.  Wh-what?  Y\\'know what, it doesn’t matter, ‘cause she picked me. Me! From now on I get the dates and you have to stay home on Saturday nights watching Ready, Set, Cook!  We’re not gonna lose to girls.  Okay, okay, so we get to take that stupid troll thing home!  Hey-hey-hey Rachel, funny thing. Actually, the ah, end zone starts at that pole, so you’re five feet short, so we win!  Yes. Yes, there is, they play on Sundays and Monday nights.  You’re not gonna die an old maid, maybe an old spinster cook.  Hey now besides, if worst comes to worst, I’ll be your boyfriend.  Why is that so funny?  Ha-ha-ha. A little to hard. What am I not ah, boyfriend material?  Hey!  What a minute, I know that hat! I was taken aboard that hat! They did experiments on me! I can’t have children!!  Buy it for ya, or win it for ya?  Big bullies!!  Hey!  Bored and bored!  Yes!  Okay, umm, we all have to play strip poker.  So, you still don’t think I’m boyfriend material?  I saw you checking me out during the game last night.  Yeah, well, lucky for you.  I don’t know.  Oh, yeah, I don’t know what they were doing, but at one point sea turtles actually came up to the house.  Where ya going?  Okay, then you gotta back away, all right? You don’t need that kind’ve hurt. Take it from a guy who’s never had a long term relationship......  Oh, ahh, no thanks, I just had an M&M.  There is not one hair on that head.  Okay! Okay! Let me try it again, you’re gonna wanna date this next guy, I swear!  That is funny. It was also funny when I made it up.  I made that joke up.  Yes, I did. I told it to Dan at work, and he said it was the funniest joke he’d ever heard.  Monica, you remember me telling you that joke, right?  Seriously?  Yeah, I guess.  It’s my joke.  Dude, you have got to turn on Behind the Music. The band Heart is having a really tough time, and I think they may break up.  Nah, Monica’s watching some cooking show. Come on, I don’t want to miss when they were skinny.  Joey, why is your cable out?  If you need money, will you please-please just let me loan you some money?  Whoa ho.  Yeah.  So, you heard it, you repeated it, so that must mean you wrote it.  And monkeys can’t write out prescriptions.  So, you stole my joke, and you stole my money.  Well, she is going to know that you stole the joke.  Yeah!  You know who else picked Rachel? Ross, and you know what else Ross did? He stole my joke. You know what? I’m going to get a joke journal. Y’know? And document the date and time of every single one of my jokes.  Yeah!  Picking Rachel.  Maybe it’s the sound of Ross climbing into my brain and stealing my thoughts.  So is your apron. You’re wearing it like a cape.  It’s my joke.  Let’s have Monica decide.  Yeah!  Mon, get out here!  Okay, okay. You have to help us decide whose joke this is.  Because you’re the only one that can be fair.  Okay, I thought of the joke two months ago at lunch with Steve.  Can I finish my story?!  I’m not arguing with that.  Is not.  Hi, oh hi.  I’m sorry. You’re not easy-going, but you’re passionate, and that’s good. And when you get upset about the little things, I think that I’m pretty good about making you feel better about that. And that’s good too. So, they can say that you’re high maintenance, but it’s okay, because I like … maintaining you.  Hey, buddy boy, how’d the audition go?  Hey.  I have no idea.  Yeah! I’m just pretending to watch the game so I don’t have to help out with stuff.  Nope! Every once and a while I just scream stuff at the TV.  Oh hey. I’d shake your hand but uh; I’m really into the game. Plus, I think it’d be better for my ego if we didn’t stand right next to each other.  I’m watching the game, but I’m not deaf!  Oh come on!  Good game!  Yeah. Solid effort. Solid effort.  Everybody at my school heard it! You were the hermaphrodite cheerleader from Long Island?!  I’m sorry. When you were in high school you made out with a 50-year-old woman?  Did she look 16?  Well, she probably wasn’t familiar with the process having spent most of her life sitting for oil paintings!  Yes, I believe we can expect a call from the President any moment now.  You’re an actor!  The Velveteen Rabbit was brown and white!  No bunny at all!! Always no bunny at all!!!  How is that me?  When have I ever done that?!  Wow! I don’t have the worst costume anymore!  Oh! Hi!  Joey’s gonna be thrilled! He was hoping you’d come by as a slutty nurse.  You’d think that would embarrass me, but you see I’m maxed out.  Howdy doody.  Oh relax man, relax. You’re looking a little flushed.  What question?  There’s no question.  I cannot believe you didn’t pick me.  And dignity.  Nope! I can do this all day.  God, I’m exhausted.  No way! If anything you’ve gotta let me win! My wife thinks I’m a wimp!  You’re Spudnik.  Listen, I’ve got a secret for ya. I let him win.  No, I let him win—Ross!  Would you tell her I let you win please?  Oh what’s the matter? Are you scared?  Hey man, what\\'s up?  Yeah, yeah! Me too!  Yeah.  Well, I like danger.  Tonight? You-you didn\\'t say it was going to be at nighttime.  It is starting to get dark out there.  Your tax dollars?  I can\\'t smell your sandwich?  Okay.  Yeah.  Sur-surprise him? We\\'re not, we\\'re not gonna make anybody mad are we?  How do you figure that?  Y\\'know, when you say partner it doesn\\'t sound cop. It, it sounds gay.  Look at Officer Ross riding back here with the visitors.  Okay, y\\'know, we-we\\'re safe right? I mean nothing bad can go down!  What\\'s going on?  Uh, HELLO!!  Who jumps at loud noises!  Oh, I just went for a walk, around the living room. Whatever…  No. No I\\'m just tired. Y\\'know, from-from the walk.  You dove in front of Ross! Ross!  I do not hate Ross!  What picture?  Look I\\'m very glad that you saved Ross from the car backfire, but y\\'know, it could\\'ve been a bullet and you y\\'know, you didn\\'t try to save me!  When it comes down to it, you would risk your life for Ross before you would for me. That\\'s the bottom line.  From a bullet!  Much sense?!  So you risked your life, for a sandwich!  So you didn\\'t uh, choose Ross before me.  Really?!  I thought you were showing me how much you mean to me.  Before or after you were shot by your own troops?  Yes, if the foxhole was lined with sandwiches.  Yeah. Hey, here\\'s an idea, why don\\'t we use our wedding china today?  Honey, she keeps canceling on us, take the hint.  What is the point of having them if we never use them?  I will explain it to her.  Muskogee! That\\'s like four hours from Tulsa. Woo hoo!  Aren\\'t you one of the stars of the popular daytime soap Days of Our Lives?  What are you going to do?  Well you proved them wrong.  I\\'ll tell you what, for the rest of our lives, I\\'ll be careful until told otherwise. <looks at china> hey wait a minute this isn\\'t the china we picked out..  Why?  Oh suddenly, flowers are feminine?  I can\\'t believe you\\'d want us to raise Emma.  You know, guys I got to say. This means so much to me. That you would trust me with your child. I mean, we all know that Monica and I have been trying to have a baby of our own. You know I\\'ve had my doubts about my skills as a father, but that you two.. that you two.... <starts to cry>  No, if crazy plate lad.. <sees Monica frustrated at this comment> If Monica dies then I would get Emma, Right?  Actually what?  What?  So if Monica\\'s not around, then I\\'m not good enough to raise Emma?  Well what is wrong with me? Am I .. am I incomptent? Because I managed to survive whatever it is that killed the three of you!  Look, I may not know a lot about babies, but do you really think I\\'m not capable?  Ok. So if we both had Emma and I die <knocks on table>  she\\'d have to give her up.  So.. let me get this straight. So my two friends die, I get Emma. Then my wife dies, then Emma the one tiny ray of hope left in my life gets taken away from me?  Oh? Did somebody miss me? Is there a child to raise poorly?  Yeah but they\\'re right. I mean, I\\'m not a strong father figure and I never will be.  Yeah, but its not who I am. Everything they said was exaclty why I was worried about having a kid. And its true. And look everybody knows it.  Oh yeah, well can you picture me saying \"Go to your room! You\\'re grounded\"?  You said that to me last week.  Oh no thats okay, you\\'re totally right. I don\\'t know anything about disciplining a child. But it did hurt my feelings and I want you to know that when I die, you don\\'t get Joey.  Alright! That is it. This is our apartment and you can not behave this way. Now if you can\\'t act your age then you shouldn\\'t be here at all. Now those plates may not be as nice as the pretty pink ones I picked out, but they\\'re very important to Monica. I want you to apologize to her right now.  Okay. Thats better. Now I want you to both apologize to each other and mean it.  By the way, that fight was totally arousing.  Oh yeah? Well thanks.  Okay, but you should know he eats five times a day and shoves pennies up his nose.  Oh no no no.. I\\'ll get her. I\\'m super-compentent and totally responsibile and fourth in line to raise Emma. I\\'ll be right there Emma. Just let me get my trusty diaper bag here. <knocks over the box of china> Well.. what do you know? I guess, I\\'ll be the one who dies first.  Nope...  Yep...  Any contact?  Come on, Ross, you gotta get back in the game here, ok? The Rachel thing\\'s not happening, your ex-wife is a lesbian—I don\\'t think we need a third...  I think it\\'s winning.  She\\'ll love it. Go with the egg, my friend.  No, it\\'s suicide. The man\\'s got an egg.  Oh, uh, listen, about tonight...  Yes, I know, but her friend sounds like such a...  ...And what did you bring?  Janice?  Ok, I\\'m makin\\' a break for it, I\\'m goin\\' out the window.  Calm down? Calm down? You set me up with the woman that I\\'ve dumped twice in the last five months!  That\\'s OK.  Tell me it\\'s \"you and me\" we.  Ok, you can not do this to me.  I hope she throws up on you.  So...  Oh, what a crappy night!  Joey\\'s not a friend. He\\'s...a stupid man who left us his credit card. Another drink? Some dessert? A big screen TV?  No... no! And yet it did. Good-bye, Janice.  Ok, well, this was very special.  Janice is gonna go away now.  Oh, good, Joey\\'s home now.  How can I dump this woman on Valentine\\'s day?  Oh, man. In my next life, I\\'m coming back as a toilet brush.  Hi, Just Janice.  Ok, Janice. Janice. Hey, Janice. Look, there\\'s no way for me to tell you this. At least there\\'s no new way for me to tell you this. I just don\\'t things are gonna work out.  Oh no, you see, actually it is.  Oh, no I don\\'t.  I did, but...  Call me!  Whoa, she\\'s pretty.  Oh, ok.  Nice!  For a minute there I thought you were actually tryin\\' to smell something.  That\\'s great. All right, I gotta get to work, I got a big dinosaur bone to inspect.  Oh, yeah.  That\\'s a little more relaxed than you want them to get.  Well, of course, lambs are scarier. Otherwise the movie would\\'ve been called Silence of the Ducks.  Yes, and this with the cigarette butt in it, is that decaf?  Believe me, sometimes that happens.  You know, it\\'s funny when my parents got divorced, they sent me to this shrink, and she told me that all kids have a tendency to blame themselves. But in your case it\\'s actually kinda true.  Damn. My mail order grandfather hasn\\'t come yet.  Monica, I feel like you should have German subtitles.  Hey! How come I\\'m stuck dicing, when he gets to ball the melon.  Well now you understand how I feel every single day, ok? The world is my lesbian wedding.  Oh, yeah?  Isn\\'t Ben in this?  Toootal chick-flick.  They\\'re still just friends, right?  I can\\'t believe we are even having this discussion.  I mean, don\\'t you think if things were gonna happen with Rachel, they would\\'ve happened already?  I can\\'t remember the last time I got a girl to take care of my monkey.  Hey, y\\'know what you should do? You should take her back to the 1890\\'s, when that phrase was last used.  Rachel lost Marcel.  Okay, it\\'s his first time out, so he\\'s probably gonna wanna do some of the touristy things. I\\'ll go to Cats, you go to the Russian Tea Room.  Marcel?  Marcel?  Um, we\\'re kind of having an emergency and we-we were looking for something...  Yes have you seen any?  Oh, nononowaitwaitwaitnono! Uh... we may not know anything about radiators per se, but we do have a certain amount of expertise in the heating and cooling... mileu.  Yes, but these women are very hot, and they need our help! And they\\'re very hot.  Okay, from now on, you don\\'t get to talk to other people.  Marcel?!  Eh. I thought that was an alp.  Yeah, well I went to boarding school with four hundred boys. Any sex I had would\\'ve involved a major lifestyle choice.  Wow! That ripped! That ripped real nice!  You don’t turn and slide, you throw it out! I’m tired of having to get a tetanus shot every time I get dressed!  All right, how about we, how ‘bout we sell it.  Uh-huh, first you tell us where you got the prettiest lace in all the land.  You want it?  Ahh, Gepeto, $5,000 dollars? Are you insane?  All right look, I’m changing it to 50 bucks, or your best offer.  I can’t believe you don’t know what I do for a living!  Yes, Joey has a very careful screening process. Apparently, not everyone is qualified to own wood and nails.  You’ll have to pardon my roommate, he wanted to marry this.  Y\\'know, I, I really don’t think we need a canoe.  All right, just, just take the entertainment center, and then when you get home, throw the canoe away!  Y\\'know what, I think this might be one of the times he’s wrong.  Oh-no, he’s right.  I’m coming already!!  OH MY GOD!!!  Are you all right?!  What the hell happened?!! How were you locked in?!! And where the hell is all of our stuff?!!  So—You got in voluntarily?!  BEND OVER?!!!  Oh, umm, Joey was born, and then 28 years later, I was robbed!!  Oh, they said uh, “You don’t have insurance here, so stop calling us.”  I like her.  Well, that’s pretty much all I’m looking for from these people.  No. This is just part of a dare devil game that I play called ‘wait until the last moment before I burst and die.’  Ginger. I’m talking to Ginger, so....  Well, that’s the best kiss I’ve had with anyone I’ve ever met in a men’s room.  Yeah, we’re gonna have to get you out of those shoes.  No, really you’re gonna freeze.  You’re not, what do you, what do you got a bionic foot?  Hey.  Oh, I hate that. I once had a thing of half and half, stole my car.  Great. It was great. She’s ah, she’s great, great looking, great personality, she’s greatness.  Joey told you about the leg, huh?  Oh God, it freaked me out. Okay, I know it shouldn’t have, but it did. I mean I like her, I don’t want to stop seeing her, but every so often it’s like ‘Hey, y\\'know what, where’s your leg?’ I mean I’m the smallest person in the world aren’t I? I’m the smallest person in the world.  It came up.  No. No. Actually I forgot, what is the deal with that again?  No. No. I don’t think so.  That’s-that’s my nubbin.  It’s kinda a ah, a third nipple kinda thing.  You ah, you have, you have to leave, now? How come?  The doctor.  Oh yes! Just had me a little nubbin-ectomy. Yep! Two nipples, no waiting.  That was an obvious joke, and I didn’t think of it. Why didn’t I think of it? The source of all my powers. Oh dear God, what have I done!  Oh, Richard. That\\'s all I ever hear, Richard, Richard, Richard!  Okay, so Richard, Richard!  What?  You okay there man?  Wow umm, calm down.  Uh, no Pheebs. What\\'s it look like?  You got the lead in a movie? That\\'s amazing! What\\'s the movie about?!  Yeah, I know that means buddy!  Well, uh, we can talk about that too Pheebs.  Whoa-whoa-whoa, what are we going to do about my job?  Thank you.  What?  Hey, so where are we staying? Is the movie putting us up in a big hotel suite?  I see, but once you get your first paycheck you\\'ll be springing a big hotel suite, right? I mean, lead in a movie, they must be paying you a lot?  So you don\\'t get paid unless the movie makes money?  All right, bye-bye now!  Okay!  We\\'ve been driving for a half-hour, and you haven\\'t looked at the road once.  Yeah.  Isn\\'t that Ross\\'s money?  I don\\'t know.  Okay!  Too dry.  No!  No!  Yes.  I also said, \"Yes!\"  Look Joe, I just, I just don\\'t want to get your hopes up real high.  They\\'re not even paying ya! This doesn\\'t even sound like a real movie!  Joe, I don\\'t think this is going to be your big break.  Oh, you don\\'t want me on the trip?  All right, I\\'ll tell ya what, the next time you ask me a question like that I\\'ll lie.  All right, fine! Fine! Why don\\'t you pull over? I\\'ll get out right now!  You\\'re not actually supposed to stop on the bridge.  Joey kicked me out of the car on the George Washington bridge!  I don\\'t know! He went crazy! Y\\'know, we were playing that game where you-you ask a question and you answer it really fast.  Well, I don\\'t know what mad him so mad, y\\'know? All I said was that uh, I didn\\'t think this wasn\\'t gonna be his big break, that this movie wasn\\'t going to do anything for him, and that uh, y\\'know it didn\\'t sound like a real movie--Okay, he should\\'ve pushed me off of the bridge.  Y\\'know, he won\\'t even talk to me. How am I going to apologize to him if he won\\'t even talk to me?  Really?  He pulled a quarter out of my ear!  Okay. Wow.  Sure.  That was you?! I thought it was Jack!  What?! Why does she think that?  Again, what?!  As we all are at some point during the day.  Ross had a ring?! And he was gonna propose?  And you did it first?! This is gonna kill him! You know how much he loves to propose!  Well, what did she say?  Does Ross know?  Well maybe you don’t have to tell him anything.  If you clear things up with Rachel then Ross never needs to find out, but you have to do it now before he hears about it and kicks your ass!  Honey, we’ve been over this. I need to be facing the other way.  Hello sir, you know Monica.  Look, we can’t stay in here forever.  I just want you to know that what you witnessed in there, that wasn’t for fun.  That’s funny, this conversation’s how I got the bullet hole in my head.  Seriously sir, my brains? All over the wall.  You still haven’t told Rachel you weren’t really proposing?  Joey, you have to tell her what’s going on! And what did it look like?!  Go and tell Rachel right now before Ross finds out.  Okay, look, just do it gently.  Hey.  Okay, she is the star of the play. And she is my girlfriend! I get to have sex with the star of the play!  I know!!  Wow! She looks great. Doesn’t she?  Is it just me, or can you actually see his abs through his overcoat?!  Yeah, it’s like someone literally wrote down my worst nightmare and then charged me $32 to see it!  I’m totally screwed. Okay, they are gonna be hot and heavy on stage every night, and then they’re gonna go to their cast parties and he’s gonna try to undermine me. Y\\'know it’ll be like, \"So where’s your boyfriend, what’s-his-name, Chester?\" And she’ll go, \"No-no-no, it’s Chandler.\" And he’ll go, \"Whatever. Ha-ha-ha-ha!\"  All right, look, look, what am I gonna do?  Really?  So uh, man, are you gonna go to the play with me tonight?  Yeah, I know but…  Okay, okay, but don’t worry, because we also have cereals, muffins, waffles, and, jams, jellies, and marmalades. Which I’m fairly certain are the same thing.  I’m right! Right? There was like no chemistry between them. Before they had heat, and now there’s no heat! Now you know what this means, Joey told us what this means!  Come on, it was like cousins having sex up there!  Oh, I loved the play. You were great, and Nick ditto. Clearly you’re having sex with him.  Oh come on, it was so obvious! There was no chemistry between you two!  Y’know, I-I could see how this could happen, y\\'know you’re up there every night, you’re naked, touching, kissing.  Well, you can understand, given how we started.  Well, that is what happened, and I don’t even see you denying this!  Yeah, well, don’t expect that to happen anytime soon!  Well, I may be drunk, but I know what she said! Then I went over to Beefsteak Julie’s…  Did she call?  All right, maybe I should call her.  Well, yeah, but y\\'know, what-what if I was wrong?  Well y\\'know, what if she didn’t actually sleep with the guy?  She did not have to tell me, I saw the play, and there was no heat. Back me up here, Ross!  That’s not backing me up! Look, you said with the off-stage and the heat, and the onstage and the oy heat.  Oh my God!!  Hey. I just, I just wanted to come over to-to say that I’m sorry. Y’know? I know I acted like the biggest idiot in the world, and I can completely understand why you were so upset.  Yeah. Well, I think our second fight is going to be a big one!  Well, she wasn’t sleeping with him.  She is now.  I’m saying that she… is a devil woman! Y’know I mean you think you know someone and then they turn around and they sleep with Nick! Nick, with his rock hard pecs, and his giant man-nipples! I hate him, I hate her! Well, I don’t hate her, I love her. This is all my fault really.  Because, I-I should’ve called! Y’know if I had just called her after our big, stupid fight, she never would’ve gone out with Nick, and they would’ve ended up in bed together. I threw her at his man nipples!  Her what?!!  You had a bachelorette party?!  I thought we weren’t gonna have bachelor/bachelorette parties! Y’know, we agreed that it was a silly tradition.  You went home with the waitress.  I can’t believe you didn’t tell me! You know that the two pillars of marriage are openness and honesty!  My God! You must be good in bed!  She’s okay with Rachel and the baby?  Well, you have to honest with her! Otherwise you may think that you’re going down the same path, but you’re really going down different ones.  What?  Honey! That’s crazy! I don’t want you to get me a stripper…  Look, I appreciate it, but uh, it’s a little creepy. Y’know? I’m not a bachelor anymore.  All right fine! But I’m only doing this for you!  And Joey.  Ah, no-no-no just Ross. Ross and Joey is embarrassing enough.  I understand: who would cancel an actual date to go to a fake bachelor party?  What are you doing?  Okay. I can’t believe tomorrow’s the big day.  You’re right, this is more fun.  That’s me.  Yeah, yeah right over there.  That was weird.  So she’s a…  I can’t believe there is a naked hooker in there!  That is funny, maybe for my birthday she’ll murder someone.  Oh actually, I’d rather you…Yeah, go ahead. We’re gonna have to burn that room down anyway.  Why would she do that?  This is the worst bachelor party ever!  Why me?!  Which is why you should do it.  You do it!  I don’t think we’ve actually done this before!  Well we…we still hang out.  Well y’know, things are different. I’m…I’m married now.  Yeah, I miss that too. I tell you what; from now on we’ll make time to hang out with each other.  Her ass print is still on your grandmother’s quilt, do you really want to talk about smoking?  Monica! Wait!  Could you not narrate?  Wait! You’re going out with Kathy!  Look, Joey, Kathy is clearly not fulfilling your emotional needs. But Casey, I mean granted I only saw the back of her head, but I got this sense that she’s-she’s smart, and funny, and gets you.  All right look, I think it’s time for you to settle down. Y\\'know? Make a choice, pick a lane.  All right! Bring it on, you…  Really, bitchin’!  You mean like, music?  Yeah, I know what you’re thinkin’! Yes, yes, your breasts are just as firm and juicy.  Come in!  Uh yes, but uh, I just watch it for the articles.  No-no, he’s not back yet, but he’ll be here any minute. So uh, come on in. Have a seat. Bow or stern?  What happened?  Why can’t you tell her?  Joey! Joey!!  I thought your time ran out.  So I guess it’s just uh, you and me then.  Yeah, I think it is!  Oh, I had an appointment to get my haircut…  …and then it got canceled.  Really?! You do that?  Dog grooming huh? Okay, just don’t make my tail too poofy.  What-what ‘cha doin’?  ‘Kay.  Hey it’s Joey!  What?  Okay.  Yeah. Yes! Yeah.  Oh.  No-no-no-no, this is bad! It’s bad! This is bad!  Wait the uh, the kiss or the situation?  Okay!  Ooh! Yes! Okay! Here’s what we do, we-we forget it happened.  Okay, we-we swallow our feelings. Even if it means we’re unhappy forever. Sound good?  I have to; he’s my best friend, and you’re seeing him.  I-I think we have too.  I sure did.  Well, I just thought it’d make me feel good to do something nice for my friend.  Well, y’know I’m 29. I mean who needs a savings account.  Oh, I don’t know.  You mean with Casey.  Or Casey.  Could be Casey.  Consider Casey.  That all the pieces of my life are falling right into place!  I kissed Kathy.  No. Is there anyway, anyway you think he’ll understand this?  Oh, don’t say that! Don’t say that. That’s not true. Is it?  Then why didn’t you tell me to do that?!!  Why?! Why do I have to tell him?!  Yeah, I know.  Hey!  Is that a real thing?  Listen ah, Joe, I-I need to, I need to talk to you about something.  It’s-it’s about Kathy. Umm, uh, I like her. I like her a lot actually.  Yeah.  What?  Oh uh, when?  Oh man, I am so sorry. Are, are you okay?  Yes, but I-I uh, don’t have too.  Yeah?  Well, I thought that would be the best thing to do.  See uh, that’s-that’s actually what I wanted to talk to you about. I-I think I know who the other guy is.  It’s me. I’m the other guy.  Yeah, I mean when you were late last night, Kathy and I got to talking, and one thing to another and…  No! No! No! I just kissed her.  How is that worse?!  Look, I’m sorry! But there’s nothing I can do, I think I’m in love with her!  You’re right, I have no excuses! I was totally over the line.  Yes. Yes! Right! And I feel horrible. You have to believe me!  Probably because…  This is so sad. I mean, I only have like ten pins.  Y’know I think we should invite them.  Well this is just sad!  Well, thanks a lot for hookin’ me up Rach. I want you to know that I want you to attend our wedding as my guest.  You mean like for award shows?  You mean these tuxes have been down the red carpet with people yelling, \"You are you wearing?! You look fabulous!\"  Not bad.  Who’s that?  Pierce Brosnan?  Are you serious?  007?! This is James Bond’s tux?!  Oh, I have to get married in James Bond’s tux!  A freakish thin date with a hanger for her head?  What?  You can’t wear that! I’m wearing the famous tux! James Bond’s tux!  So—If you wear that you’ll make mine less special.  Please, don’t take away my cool thing. Please?! Pretty please?!  Look, it’s my wedding day okay? If you were getting married I would never do anything to upset you.  That was pretty 007.  Ross is Batman!  Rachel got Ross the tuxedo that Val Kilmer wore in Batman. Okay Batman is so much cooler than James Bond!  Batman has a utility belt!  Batman has the Batmobile!  Actually, I don’t like martinis.  I would but mine doesn’t fit. The pants are a little tight.  Well, does that mean that you’re not going to wearing yours?  An invitation for the At First Sight premiere? Oh my God! Val Kilmer didn’t wear this in Batman! He wore it to the premiere of some tooty-fruity love story where he played a blind guy!  Well, you’re welcome. And tell them we’re really glad they’re coming.  Whose is it?  Whose is it?  Oh, come on! I don’t care! Come on! Whose is it?  Ho! Ho! Ho!  Your pants!  Uhh, a T-shirt that says, \"I don’t belong here.\"  Yeah we do!  Are you serious?  Forget it! Okay, I’m not giving up my bachelor pad for some basketball seats!  No. But uh, Joey has, and I usually talk to them in the morning time.  Forget it! Okay, I’m not giving up the apartment.  Oh my God!  You do know that Wham broke up?  Where is Emily?  Man, didn’t she like just get here?  Easy tiger.  So what are you going to do?  Are you serious?  Because you’ve only known her for six weeks! Okay, I’ve got a carton of milk in my fridge I’ve had a longer relationship with!  Okay, no problem, just remember to wake us up before you go-go.  No thank you.  Look, I want those basketball seats as much as you do! Okay, but we can’t leave in the small apartment after we’ve lived here! Didn’t you ever read Flowers for Algernon?  Look, the only way I will even consider this is if they offer a lot more than just season seats.  Screw the Knicks!  I didn’t mean that. I just meant that the apartment is worth so much more.  And the Knicks rule all.  No. No. We’re not gonna do that, y’know why? Because its not an even trade.  No!  Op, op, I’m convinced!  All right, but you can’t use that again for a whole year. I’m in.  Okay!  Fine, let’s do it.  Okay, you guys uh, you guys pick first  That’s a low one!  Why are you screaming and hugging?  Yeah baby!  No they didn’t!  Those were like the best seats ever.  Oh yeah, that’s very nice. Plus, y’know they were free and they’re too small.  I KNOW!!!  Open up! Open up! Open up!  What the hell is going on?!  We are switching back, right now!  Well, you’re gonna have to leave sometime, because you both have jobs, and as soon as you do, we’re switching it back! There’s nothing you can do to stop us! Right, Joe?  What?  I don’t care, this is our apartment! And they stole—you stole it—our apartment, and we won that apartment fair and square, twice! And I am getting it back right now. I’m getting back right now!  Oh no-no-no, no more offers. You can’t offer anything to us!  Totally worth it!  Good night.  Okay!  Oh, well, that’s great!  We can? All right, I\\'m tryin\\' that.  So, Saturday night, the big night, date night, Saturday night, Sat-ur-day night!  Not a one.  Oh, right, right, shut up.  No, I know, but it\\'s just so hard, you know? I mean, you\\'re sitting there with her, she has no idea what\\'s happening, and then you finally get up the courage to do it, and there\\'s the horrible awkward moment when you\\'ve handed her the note.  Oh, thanks, but I think she\\'d feel like we\\'re gangin\\' up on her.  Ooh, I hate when my father calls me that.  Oh. Well, hold on camper, are you sure you\\'ve thought this thing through?  It\\'s just you and Rachel, just the two of you? This is a date. You\\'re going on a date.  Yuh-huh.  Well, you may wanna rethink the dirty underwear. This is basically the first time she\\'s gonna see your underwear—you want it to be dirty?  Oh, and uh, the fabric softener?  There you go.  Where are they? Where are they?  It\\'s great. Maybe tomorrow we can rent a car and run over some puppies.  Here we go.  Hey, Janice.  Hey, that\\'s not good. Can I get an espresso and a latte over here, please?  What?  Bullwinkle socks. That\\'s so sweet.  That\\'s great.  Well, I\\'m gonna get another espresso. Can I get you another latte?  That\\'s it?  Oh, yeah, that hug looked pretty brutal.  Janice. Hi, Janice. Ok, here we go. I don\\'t think we should go out anymore. Janice.  Oh, my god, I\\'m so sorry. Are you ok?  Oh, I don\\'t know, a million?  I\\'m fine.  I\\'m not fine. Here she comes.  How do you do that?  We should always always break up together.  I\\'m free! I\\'m free!  So, what do you say? Can you get out of work?  Are you really that busy?  I don\\'t have travel insurance.  Hi, Chandler Bing, I have a reservation.  New York.  I\\'m sorry, he\\'s a little bit wound up, we had to stop at every maple candy stand on the way here.  Well, that\\'s impossible, can you check again, please?  Let me get this straight. I called yesterday trying to cancel my reservation and I was told it was not refundable, then we drove six hours all the way up here and now you tell me that we don\\'t have a reservation?  Just give us the cheapest room you have.  That\\'s insane!  Great, at a hundred dollars an apple, we\\'re there!  Dude, you\\'re shaking!  USA Today  And I also got... two more apples.  I also got this great salt and pepper shaker from the restaurant.  Yes, but the batteries...  Thank you, thank you very much!  No!  Oh we did, and you still have all your lamps.  Oh, I didn\\'t factor in the room tax.  What?  Look, we have enough, just walk away.  There\\'s a forest right outside.  Ok, go quick!  Alright, alright, but you better be wearing clothes when I open my eyes.  Sweet mother of all that is good and pure.  Congratulations!  Now we can finally watch Green Acres the way it was meant to be seen.  So uh, which one is mine?  Well they were chair-shaped cows. They never would have survived in the wild.  Uh, two larges, extra cheese on both. But listen, don\\'t ring the buzzer for 19, ring 20, Geller-Green, they\\'ll let you in, OK. If you buzz our door, there\\'s no tip for you. OK, thanks. Pizza\\'s on the way. I told you we wouldn\\'t have to get up.  I\\'ll cancel the sodas.  So how\\'d it go?  Yeah, but uh, it was 1982 and my flock of seagulls haircut was tickling her chin.  It\\'s the Miracle Wax.  Listen can you guys uh, speak up, it\\'s harder for us to hear you when you lower your voice.  Could you get us a couple of beers?  She\\'s one of us now.  Well maybe he was nervous.  Hi!  We\\'re just here to say goodbye, we\\'re off to Ohio.  And so incorrect!  Uhm, thank you, but we\\'re really trying not to get our hopes up.  Yeah. I mean, this girl could decide against adoption or she could like another couple better..  I can develop a condition in which I talk and talk and no one hears a word.  So we\\'re standing firm on the \\'not getting our hopes up\\'?  Yes, but...  Oh, screw it, I\\'m gonna be a daddy!!  Yeah. Just weird, you know. It\\'s like: \"Hi, I\\'m Chandler. May I have the human growing inside you?\"  You\\'re gonna be great.  Thank you so much for agreeing to see us.  Ok.  That\\'s what our friends call us.  So, the fact that I am a doctor, and my wife’s a reverend, that’s important to you?  Plus I thought the baby would be in good hands with a doctor!  Yeah, wow.  No-ot for me it doesn’t.  Yeah, actually. So, you read a file that you liked and you gave the agency the serial number and they contacted us?  You should be. You’re really on top of stuff..  Yeah, I did.  We are NOT signing those papers.  It\\'s wrong. They made a mistake. They think we\\'re somebody else.  You have gotta stop!  She likes Doctor Chandler and Reverend Monica.  Your Veal Chop is $34,95!  But we are not the one she chose! How can you feel okay about this?  I know..  oh, honey..  Monica, I want a baby too, but this woman is giving away her child. She deserves to know who it\\'s going to.  So, we\\'ll tell the truth and who knows, maybe she\\'ll like us for us.  You\\'re Jewish.  Hey.  The agency must have made some mistake. My wife is not a reverend and I\\'m not a doctor.  I could perform an operation on you and prove it if you\\'d like.  Well, our names really are Monica and Chandler. We\\'re from New York.  Erica wait!  You have every reason to be upset. We did lie. But only because we\\'ve been waiting and trying to have a baby for so long. Now we don\\'t know how long it\\'s gonna be before we can get another chance again.  Erica, please. Just consider us. Ask them to see our file. Our last name\\'s Bing. My wife\\'s a chef and I\\'m in advertising.  But you did like us. And you should. My wife\\'s an incredible woman. She\\'s loving and devoted and caring. And don\\'t tell her I said this but the woman\\'s always right... I love my wife more than anything in this world. And I... It kills me that I can\\'t give her a baby... I really want a kid. And when that day finally comes, I\\'ll learn how to be a good dad. But my wife... she\\'s already there. She\\'s a mother... without a baby... Please?  You still want that baby?  This is the New York Times.  We are. He’s meeting us here.  Yeah y-you, how hard is it to say something? Rachel came over to borrow something.  Y\\'know what this is like? This is like when my parents got divorced. Man, I hope Ross doesn’t try to kidnap me after Cub Scouts.  Y\\'know what maybe it’s gonna be okay, I mean it’s been a week.  No.  Yes, yes, it’s just that we ah, we kinda all ready, made plans with Ross.  Yeah, he’s really excited about it too, he even recorded show times on his answering machine.  Well, actually, yesterday I was smoking again. Today, I’m, I’m smoking still.  Look, I’m telling you this is just like my parents divorce, which is when I started smoking in the first place.  Yeahhh. I’m tellin’ ya something, that ah, first smoke after nap time....  Oh that’s great, with my luck, that’s gonna be him.  Hey, shut up!! You’re not my real Mom!!  Can somebody else hug him? I have to stay by the window.  Well, then, I might as well offer to stay.  What?  Beam me up Jesus.  Okay, well, then, I-I have to go to the bathroom.  Oh, come on, there’s a rest stop right up there! Come on, I really have to goooooooooo.  Here we go. Okay, brace yourselves.  Oh, no-no-no-no-no-no!!  Oh I do! Op, no, wait a minute, I took it out of my shirt when I put it on this morning.  Ladies, ladies, let’s just compromise okay? Phoebe, Rachel take off Monica’s bra.  Well, I thought if I littered, that crying Indian might come by and save us.  Okay, now let’s decide who has the nicest ass.  At least let me smoke it to the good part.  Well it’s very unsettling.  Oh no, now it’s not gonna make any sense!  Oh, this is horrible, it’s just horrible.  It’s horrible.  Y\\'know what, I can handle it, handle’s my middle name. Actually it’s the ah, middle part of my first name.  I was being Shelly Winters from The Poseidon Adventure.  Or \\'You\\'re such a nice guy\\' means \\'I\\'m gonna be dating leather-wearing alcoholics and complaining about them to you\\'.  Yeah, it\\'s like when you\\'re a kid, and your parents put your dog to sleep, and they tell you it went off to live on some farm.  \"So how does it feel knowing you\\'re about to die?\"  Hey, that was really good!  Okay. \"So. Whaddya want from me, Damone, huh?\"  \"Smoke away.\"  I think this is probably why Damone smokes in his cell alone.  Relax your hand!  Not so much!  Hey!  Alright, now try taking a puff.  Alright.. okay. No. Give it to me.  It\\'s fine, it\\'s fine. Look, do you wanna get this part, or not? Here.  Don\\'t think of it as a cigarette. Think of it as the thing that\\'s been missing from your hand. When you\\'re holding it, you feel right. You feel complete.  Oh, Satan\\'s minions at work again...  I\\'m smoking. I\\'m smoking, I\\'m smoking.  And this- is my reward!  Okay, so this time I won\\'t quit!  What are you talking about? We love Schhteve! Schhteve was schhexy!.. Sorry.  Yep, we sure showed those Hassidic jewellers a thing or two about softball..  I personally could have a gallon of Alan.  Well, maybe it\\'s a contest, y\\'know? Like, collect all five?  Hey, this is so unfair!  So I have a flaw! Big deal! Like Joey\\'s constant knuckle-cracking isn\\'t annoying? And Ross, with his over-pronouncing every single word? And Monica, with that snort when she laughs? I mean, what the hell is that thing? ...I accept all those flaws, why can\\'t you accept me for this?  Hey, y\\'know, I have had it with you guys and your cancer and your emphysema and your heart disease. The bottom line is, smoking is cool, and you know it.  Ooh, Lambchop. How old is that sock? If I had a sock on my hand for thirty years it\\'d be talking too.  Joey ate my last stick of gum, so I killed him. Do you think that was wrong?  ...That\\'s it. I\\'m getting cigarettes.  Ye-e-es!!  Who’s number two? One of the more difficult games sewer workers play.  Bye!  Yeah, and I don’t have any cologne.  Oh! Worm medicine for the duck.  Okay. I just wanted them to hear it from somebody else.  Almost as good as that play with the two naked girls on the see-saw.  I know.  So that’s the girl you like.  Wait a minute, wait a minute, you don’t like the guy Rachel’s dating? Well, that’s odd.  Could I borrow it?  Oh-ho-ho-ho.  Ross, don’t. Ross!  Ohh, that’s a good one.  Why don’t you use ours across the hall, ‘cause she…has…problems.  Step away from the duck.  And yet, she’s still not hanging up the phone.  Hey!  What?! No! No!  I didn’t know you read tea leaves.  What does yours say Pheebs?  Well, I’m sure you get another one at Ann Taylor’s.  I know it’s tough now, but things will get better.  I’m not great at the advice, can I interest you in a sarcastic comment? Some cheese?  Let’s just say if I can’t find the right CD case I just put it in the nearest one.  In the James Taylor case.  Honey, I’m gonna save you some time, 200 CDs, not one of them in the right case.  Well, if we’re gonna do that we should come up with some kind of order. Y’know alphabetically or by genre?  Oh my God, honey we are so meant to be together. We both have copies of the Annie soundtrack.  What problem did you tell him you had?  You can always sell your baby.  Wow, Ralph Lauren is really going out of there way to show they’re not in the baby buying business.  Oh I’m sorry, you’re kicking me out of my own living room?  God that is good TV.  Phoebs, play with meeee.  Ya know Phoebs, don\\'t feel so bad for \\'em. After they\\'re done playing, I break out the little plastic women and everybody has a pretty good time.  Ah he\\'s a, he\\'s not a big fan of foosball.  No he\\'s, he\\'s alright, just uh, he spends most of his time in his room.  We don\\'t need to remedy that.  That was so lame.  So, you uh, you think that Speed Racer guy gets a lot of tickets er?  What\\'re you kidding? I broke up with her. She actually thought that Sean Penn was the capital of Cambodia.  Well it\\'s not Sean Penn.  Hi.  Oh, uh, he\\'s not here right now, uh, I\\'m Chandler, can I take a message, or, or a fishtank?  Oh, oh, c\\'mon in.  Oh.  Oh yeah, your uh, name came up in a uh, conversation that terrified me to my very soul.  Yes. Hey, can I ask you, is Eddie a little...  Bit country? C\\'mon in here you roomie.  Bye.  So, we gettin\\' a fish?  Eddie, I didn\\'t sleep with your ex-girlfriend.  This is nuts. This is crazy. She came over for like two minutes, dropped off a fish tank, and left, end of story.  Buddy?  There was no fish when she dropped it off.  So, when I woke up this morning, he\\'d stolen all the insoles out of my shoes.  Because he thinks I slept with his ex-girlfriend and killed his fish.  Because sometimes, Phoebe after you sleep with someone, you have to kill the fish.  Oh, I\\'m fine about my problem now, by the way.  We\\'re worried about you.  We came over as soon as we saw.  It\\'s gonna be ok. You know that?  I\\'m sorry man.  Uhhhaahh.  Yeah alright. What\\'re these, raisins?  And we\\'re done with the chicken fried rice.  Or we can do the actual telephone thing.  Hey.  Really?  Phoebe, it\\'s me. You can tell me anything.  What\\'s going on?  Well, my Grandfather was Swedish and my Grandmother was actually a tiny little bunny.  Y\\'know that is a popular opinion today I must say.  The weirdest thing happened at the coffee house, I think, I think Phoebe was hitting on me.  I\\'m telling you I think Phoebe thinks I\\'m foxy.  Ow!  Oh, y\\'know I-I can\\'t hear that enough.  No, I didn\\'t misunderstand, okay? She was all over me! She touched my bicep for crying out loud!  Well it\\'s not flexed right now!  Sure, I\\'ll do it with ya.  That new mountain bike?  Your work makes me sad.  Okay, so now do you believe that she\\'s attracted to me?  Are you serious?  Phoebe knows about us!  Oh man!  Ahh yes, the messers become the messies!  Well you know that thing you said before, I\\'d be lying if I said I wasn\\'t intrigued.  Yeah, listen, Joey isn\\'t gonna be here tonight so why don\\'t you come over and I\\'ll let you uh, feel my bicep. Or maybe more.  Oh yeah, they\\'re totally gonna back down!  Yes.  Okay, listen, how far am I gonna have to go with her?  How do you know?!  At this?!  Phoebe.  Come on in.  Sure.  Me? No. You?  So do I.  I\\'m gonna put on some music.  You look good.  Well, why don\\'t we move this into the bedroom?  Oh, do you not want to?  Listen, this is totally getting out of hand! Okay? She wants me to put lotion on her!  Oh, you\\'re-you\\'re going?  Not if I kiss you first.  Well, I guess there\\'s nothing left for us to do but-but kiss.  Okay! Okay! Okay! You win! You win!! I can\\'t have sex with ya!  Because I\\'m in love with Monica!!  Yes, and we\\'d appreciate it if no one told him yet.  Oh come on man! At least let me finish this last one.  Okay.  No-no, why don’t you hang on to that one.  Okay, that’s like the least fun game ever.  Or what my Father called Thursday night.  Y\\'know, I would’ve bet good money that he’d be the first one of us to get married.  Always illegal Joe.  If that doesn’t keep kids in school, what will?  Y\\'know, I forgot the combination to this about a year ago? I just carry it around. Do you have any Chap Stick?  Y\\'know what, pretty good.  Good! I haven’t smoked yet today, I feel great, and-and-and confident, that is a stunning blouse.  Thanks  What check thing?  Who’s he huggin’?  This guy invented Moss 865! Every office in the world uses that program!  There you go!!  Okay, okay, just because he buys you dinner, does not mean you owe him anything.  Okay, then get the lobster!  Okay. Well, I think the centerpieces are too big  Kinda. They’re really big.  What?  No. No, see when I first meet somebody it’s uh it’s mostly panic, anxiety, and a great deal of sweating.  Sleeping with somebody new, anxiety, panic, and I’m afraid even more sweating.  Well yeah! But now that I know that you’re having these thoughts, I’m back to panic, anxiety, and uh I’m definitely gonna need some kind of sports drink.  Hey Joe! You wanna shoot some hoops?  That’s great.  You’ll be perfect for this! That’s already your name!  Okay, I guess we can lose to junior high girls some other time.  Bamboozled?  Bogota.  What does a Wicked Wango card do?  Higher or lower than what?  Let me see that.  Triscadecaphobia.  Fear of Triscuts?  This game makes no sense!  Oh come on Ross, I think we’re all losers here.  Let me think. Let me think—Oh! I don’t care.  Either, it makes no difference.  I’ll take a card.  This game is kinda fun.  I don’t think the contestants are supposed to speak to each other.  Treasure of the Sierra Madre!  Madre Sierra the of Treasure!  I’d like to go up the ladder of chance to the golden mud hut please.  Six!  Tell it to the Time Turtle!  I’d like a Google Card.  Nooo!!  This is the best game ever!!!  So, where\\'s Mike?  Hey.  Why are you wearing my apron?  Oh, those places! There\\'s always so many people, their being corralled like cattle, and... you know, there\\'s always some idiot who goes \"Mooooo\"!  I\\'m so sorry...  Monica. Calm, self.  Why would you say that?  Yeah, I\\'ve been to these places before, but I\\'ve never really seen them, you know.  Oh, uhm, okay, uhm, do you mind if we ask you some questions about the father?  That\\'s great.  So, what does the other guy do? Does he go to college too?  I\\'ll bet his dad doesn\\'t think so.  Honey, it\\'s us. Of course it\\'s the shovel-killer.  I\\'d keep an eye on him! We have to find out which one the father is.  I dunno, aren\\'t there tests for these things, right?  Pff, easy for you to say, he\\'s a father killer. He probably loves him mommy. He\\'s probably got a tattoo that says \"mom\" on his shovel-wielding arm!  Hey! How was lunch?  Oh God. It\\'s shovely-Joe, isn\\'t it?  How do you know?  Oh God! What was it? The thing that we hardly ever do or the thing we never do?  Actually, it pays nothing. It\\'s an internship.  Well, it\\'s a training program, but at the end, they hire the people they like.  Yeah, I mean, there\\'s probably gonna be some ground work which will probably stink, you know, grown man getting people coffee is a little humiliating  Oh, no, no, I\\'m an intern, just like you guys… except for the tie, the briefcase… and the fact that I can rent a car.  Yeah, well, I\\'m kinda heading into a new career direction and, you know, you gotta start at the bottom.  The comedian? USO?!  I am so much older than these other interns. I can\\'t compete with them.  They\\'re these prototype sneakers and come up with ideas on how to sell them which I can\\'t do because no self-respecting adult would ever where these.  What am I supposed to do with these?  No, I don\\'t think that\\'s the kinda thing they\\'re looking for.  Hey!  Putting on the sneakers… thought I\\'d get into a younger mindset, you know, to see if it sparked anything…  Yes, how\\'s this: They\\'re so uncomfortable it\\'s like getting kicked in the nuts for your feet!  A-huh. So he\\'s rolling down the street and he starts to lose control, you know… maybe he falls… maybe hurts himself. Just then, a kid comes flying by wearing the shoes. He jumps over the old guy and laughs, and the line reads: \"Not suitable for adults!\"  The cold weather hurts my hip!  What did I marry into?  You guys just keep getting cooler and cooler!  Who?  You\\'re right, by saying \"nice\" I\\'m virtually licking her.  Are you asking permission to break the pact?  Awesome, the name really stands out.  Man, we\\'re gonna rock that Asian student union!  Hey!  You know, our band is playing on Friday.  Fresh!  Mint!  I know it. You know, I\\'m totally gonna ask her out.  I said it first, bro.  Totally. I had sex in High school...  All right, I\\'d say we make a pact. Neither of us will go out with Missy Goldberg.  All right, so that\\'s Missy Goldberg, Phoebe Cates and Molly Ringwald, who neither of us can go out with.  Oh, and Sheena Easton. But we probably couldn\\'t get her anyway.  Well, I officially give you permission to break the pact.  Your hands are shaking.  Ross, that was 16 years ago!  Oh really?  Oh really!?  Oh please, and you knew how much I liked her.  Really?  Aren\\'t you...?  Hi Monica.  Not her!  Soo... you girls having fun?  Well maybe if you go to school here next year we can totally hang out.  Well, maybe you can get in on a beauty scholarship.  So where are you applying to?  I\\'m in college and I\\'m in a band.  Yeah, but it was like a million years ago, so it doesn\\'t matter.  Why?  You kissed her that night too?  Seriously, where did this happen?  Oh wait... What bed did you say she was on?  I\\'m pretty sure I put her on my bed.  Why would I kiss a girl, and then put her on your bed?  What did I marry into?  Did you see our bank statement? Can this be right?  I\\'m not sure what they did, but I\\'m inclined to blame Enron.  Maybe I should quit and get a job that pays.  You know what? You know what? I think we\\'re making too big a deal out of this. ok? So we pay our bills a little late this month and maybe next month we cut back on a few things. And maybe we start eating out of Joey\\'s refrigerator for a change. You\\'re chef... what can you make out of backing soda and beer?  No! We\\'re not borrowing money.  Because we don\\'t do that. We are Bings! And if there\\'s one thing my father taught me was... well to always knock before going into the pool house... but the other thing was never borrow money.  That\\'s right! I do! And I\\'m your man. And I\\'m going to get us through this situation even if it means you working twice as hard.  Yeah.... she\\'s not so cute.  Yes dear.  Hey Joe!  Listen er..I need to ask you a favor but you can\\'t tell Monica anything about it.  What? What do you mean you know?  Oh! Right.  Anyway, err... I need to borrow some money.  Oh ok.  I can\\'t believe her! Did she tell you we were having money problems?  What?  What would she get for herself for two thousand dollars that she wouldn\\'t tell me about?  Hey Rach! There she is...My perfectly proportioned wife.  Oh no..don\\'t thank me. Thank you. You know there\\'s not one thing I would change about you? Not one single thing! And definitely not... two... single things.  No no! I just love the way you look, I am warm, for your form.  Well yes yes... You look nice can mean that your face looks nice. I want to compliment your body. I mean..I wouldn\\'t change it. At all. And more specifically, I wouldn\\'t want anything to get any bigger.  I mean, You wouldn\\'t want any part of me to get any bigger would you? Don\\'t answer that.  Yeah?  But honey you don\\'t have to.  Honey I... I love your breasts the way they are!  your ass?!?!?  They...do that?  God why why would you want to do that to yourself!?  Alright look, if it means that much to you, a may be able to get on more with the big boobs. But the giant ass and the big clown feet?  Well! We er..climbed up four flights of stairs, manueveored a narrow hallway, dodged a rabid pitbul... but these last three feet are where it gets really tricky.  Aaaaand....... hernia.  Hi!  Yeah?  Okay.  Okay. I’ve been thinking about it too, and I, I think we’re ready.  But you said you were ready too.  Yes, but haven’t you wanted a kid like forever?  I’m not crazy about babies. I’m crazy about us.  Look, we’ve always talked about having babies someday. I’m not saying it has to be right now, but I’m starting to think that we can handle it. We’re good. We’re really good.  But nothing has to happen until your ready.  What?! It’s not right! We’re not ready to have a kid now!!  I’m kidding. This is going to be fun.  Period math?  Yeah.  Right here?  Wait a minute, it’s perfect. We got a lot of time to kill and we’re in a building that’s full of beds!  Yes, 98.6. You’re gonna be fine.  Should we tell Rachel there’s an empty private room right next door to hers?  Well let me think about that, while I remove my pants!  If it’s not, then there’s two of them. And that would mean it’s the end of the world!  Hi.  Jan-Janice!  Janice I didn’t even know you were pregnant! Who’s the unwitting human who’s essence you’ve stolen?  What?!  That’s funny. Does it-does it hurt? Does the labor hurt?  It’s incredible, I mean one minute she’s inside you and then 47 hours later here she is.  So, do you know what you’re gonna call her yet?  So then I guess Ferdinad is out.  You do?  Oh no, it’s gonna be named after some snack or baked good isn’t it?  That was amazing.  And if not, we got to do it on a bucket.  Oh hey, how\\'d the interview go?  So what happened?  Well you coulda tried, not kissing him.  Come on, Rach.  Uh, yeah.  Why?  Ohh, so?  Monica, you have got to stop this competitive thing! Okay? It\\'s crazy. {Finally! The voice of reason.} I mean, just impress Gary and Phoebe we have to go upstairs and have sex over and over and I\\'m saying no to this, why? Get your coat.  That was amazing!  That was amazing.  No, you\\'re the best.  No, you\\'re the best.  Honey, the tortilla chips know what you mean.  No. And if I did, I don\\'t think we\\'d be going out. Monica, this is getting ridiculous!  Ugh, we have already proved that we are hot! Okay? So why-why are you getting so obsessed about this thing?!  Oh wow! Is that what this all have been about?  Yeah that was great. That was really great! But to tell you the truth, I\\'m more excited about where we are right now.  Yeah?  Y\\'know what I just realized? You just freaked out about our relationship.  Yes you did! Admit it! You freaked out!  Man, I am so beat.  Hey, you just wanna forget about raquetball and hang out here?  Ok, there is one more way to say it, who knows it?  No actually, I was just going for colorful.  What just happened?  That, that is funny. Can I have it back?  No?  Stop talking, stop talking now. Let me just get this straight. You\\'re actually stealing my hat?  No, just wanna make sure we\\'re on the same page.  The mean guys at the coffee house took my hat.  Na, forget it, it\\'s probably stripped and sold for parts by now.  Hey.  Do you have to be a Century 21 real-estate agent to get to wear those really cool jackets?  Alright, I\\'ll tell you what, you call the couch and then, and then we\\'ll call the couch, and we\\'ll see who it comes to.  Don\\'t play with his things.  You had to ask.  I think you played the Gunther card too soon.  Your cappucino sir.  Ya know I think this is much better than the coffee house.  Ok.  No?  Alright, hang on a second there Custer.  Well, couldn\\'t we just lose our virginities again? Ya know, because I think actually mine\\'s growing back.  Ah, there we go.  You burn your mouth?  Bullies, big bullies.  Yes, we\\'re standing out ground...apparently.  Alright, let\\'s do this.  Question. If I don\\'t care about my watch, can I use it as a weapon?  Well, it\\'s sharp, it\\'s metal, I think I can do some, you know, serious damage with it.  Ok.  Ok, so let me just get this straight. So we\\'re uh, strictly talking about the middle?  Yeah, I wouldn\\'t know having missed everything.  Ok so, can I have my hat back?  Hi Monica.  Guys guys, check this out.  Oh, yeah?  We really need to take those tests?  But I don\\'t wanna do it in a cup!  It\\'s weird! In a doctor\\'s office?  Yeah, ok. I\\'m sure that doctor\\'s office can\\'t be worst than on a class trip to the Hershey\\'s factory!  Oh, yeah! RACHEL TALKS TOO!  Deposit my specimen? You know, usually I have to call a 900 number for that kind of talk. Thanks, got it.  Yeah, I guess!  Oh, Come on!  Why are you here?  What!?  Yeah! yeah... The hard part is over!  I haven\\'t... I haven\\'t even thought about the results yet... I just assumed that everything was gonna be ok.  Doctor Connelly just called.  Actually it\\'s both of us.  Apparently my sperm have low motility and you have an inhospitable environment.  I\\'m sorry.  Well, we\\'re gonna... we\\'re gonna figure this out.  Mrs. Tedlock. You\\'re looking lovely today. And may I say, that is a very flattering sleeve length on you.  Hey!  So, it\\'s a typical day at work. I\\'m inputting my numbers, and big Al calls me into his office and tells me he wants to make me processing supervisor.  So.... I quit.  Why? This was supposed to be a temp job!  If I took this promotion, it\\'d be like admitting that this is what I actually do.  It doesn\\'t matter. I just don\\'t want to be one of those guys that\\'s in his office until twelve o\\'clock at night worrying about the WENUS.  Weekly Estimated Net Usage Systems. A processing term.  I don\\'t know. That\\'s the thing. I don\\'t know what I want to do. I just know I\\'m not going to figure it out working there.  Yeah... I just don\\'t have that much cheffing experience. Unless it\\'s an all-toast restaurant.  Thanks, Phoebe. But I just don\\'t really see myself in a big white hat.  Can you see my nipples through this shirt?  Hey, you guys all know what you want to do.  Hey, you guys in the living room all know what you want to do. You know, you have goals. You have dreams. I don\\'t have a dream.  Was it formerly owned by a blonde woman and some bears?  Who are you going out with?  And he\\'s not speaking metaphorically.  Can you believe it? I mean, don\\'t I seem like somebody who should be doing something really cool? You know, I just always pictured myself doing something...something.  Ooh, you know, I had a grape about five hours ago, so I\\'d better split this with you.  It\\'s OK. It\\'s OK. I was always rooting for you two kids to get together.  Again?  Well?  Thank you Helen, that\\'ll be all.  Last time I do that, I promise.  Yeah, but I\\'m, I\\'m so much faster...  No.  Had it.  Hey, look Joey, I\\'m just saying if you need something to hold you over, I can get you a job right here as an entry level processor.  It\\'s not that hard to learn. And as for people realizing you have no idea what you\\'re doing, hey, you\\'re an actor. Act like a processor, people will think you\\'re a processor.  Hey thanks. Scott Alexander, Joey Tribbianni. Joey is a uh, fellow processor.  I was just telling Joey about the opening in Fleischman\\'s group.  Hey, how\\'s the first day goin\\'?  Well there you go.  Jeannie, the head of east coast operations Jeannie?  Weird world. Your kids?  Ya know there isn\\'t a part of that sentence I don\\'t need explained.  Well, invisible kids can be that way sometimes.  Really? Wow. That\\'s some pretty powerful imaginary sperm you must have there.  Well, I\\'m sure you\\'ll teach her a lesson when she steps off the dock onto nothing. Hey Mr. Douglas.  Well the people in my group wanna spend the holiday weekend with their families.  It\\'s about cutting my people a little slack, ya know, for morale. Look, if you wanna see some rough numbers, I can get them to you by Wednesday.  Uh, if you say so sir.  Well, I\\'m going to kill you.  Why?  Why? Wh- wh- why is Mr. Douglas looking for me?  Wha- wh- why, why, why does he suspect that?  Alright, that\\'s it. Look Joey, I\\'m sorry, I realize this is the role of a lifetime for ya, and if I could just fire Joseph, I would, but unfortunately that\\'s not possible so I\\'m gonna have to let both of you go.  I don\\'t, I hate Joseph, ok. I think he\\'s a brown-nosing suck up.  Alright, ok, alright. So I can\\'t fire Joseph but uh, I can sleep with his wife.  Yeah, Karen. I\\'m thinking about having an affair with her. Oh, you know what? I just did.  Oh well it\\'s not me, it\\'s my character, Chandy. Yeah the rogue processor who seduces his co-worker\\'s wives for sport and then laughs about it the next day at the water cooler. In fact, I have her panties right there in my drawer.  No freakshow, she\\'s fictional.  Thank you.  Oh, great. This is just...  Oh my God, it\\'s that Victoria\\'s Secret model. Something... something Goodacre.  Jill says vestibule... I\\'m going with vestibule.  Oh! Some guy. Some guy. \\'Hey Jill, I saw you with some guy last night. Yes, he was some guy.  Alright, alright, alright. It\\'s been fourteen and a half minutes and you still have not said one word. Oh God, do something. Just make contact, smile!  There you go!  You\\'re definitely scaring here.  Hey, it\\'s me.  I\\'m trppd... in an ATM vstbl... wth Jll Gdcr!  I\\'m trppd... in an ATM vstbl... wth JLL GDCR.  Yeah, like that thought never entered my mind.  Um, is it sugarless?  Oh, then no thanks. What the hell was that? Mental note: If Jill Goodacre offers you gum, you take it. If she offers you mangled animal carcass, you take it.  OK.  Yes. Yes, thanks for letting me use your phone... and for saving my life.  Hi, um, I\\'m account number 7143457. And, uh, I don\\'t know if you got any of that, but I would really like a copy of the tape.  Couldn’t I just say, \"This is Ross?\"  Hey!  Yeah, I’d love to but I’ve tried that so many times they won’t even let me in the store anymore.  That’s awesome! That’s great! What made you do it?!  Whoa-whoa-whoa! You broke Joey’s chair?  I thought I broke Joey’s chair! That’s why I replaced it with mine!  Well, what did you think, that-that elves came in and fixed it?  Joey you broke my chair!!  I think I should get the chair!  Well, where’s the logic in that?!  So Joey breaks my chair and I get nothing!  What are you guys? Like a gang or something?!  Hey  Oh, she\\'s at home, putting up decorations for Rachel\\'s birthday party tonight.  I tried, but apparantly singing \"I will survive\" in a helium voice - not helping.  Yes, Bravo on the hot nanny.  Are you kidding? If I wasn\\'t married she\\'d be rejecting me right now.  Now that Rachel\\'s gone?  I wasn\\'t staring. I was leering.  Looks like Joey is doing allright with her.  Seriously dude, 3 years ago.  You don\\'t trust him?  Is this really your long term plan, for me to run interference? Because I could get a job any day now.  Allright, fine, but don\\'t blame me if it doesn\\'t work. Because you know as well as I do that once Joey sets his mind on something, more often than not, he\\'s going to have sex with it.  Picturing that tree?  Where you going, Joe?  Oh. You mind if I join you?  Your thoughts? Plural?  I\\'m afraid I can\\'t let you do that, Joe.  Yes, as a matter of fact he did, so I can\\'t let you go.  Great novels?  Oh, uh, well, I haven\\'t seem it but if I do I\\'ll let you know.  Well, they\\'re Joey\\'s! They gotta be Joey\\'s!  See? They\\'re Joey\\'s! J-J-J-J-J-Joey\\'s!  Yeah!  Well, yeah actually.  I know it sounds really weird, but we\\'re just so bad at relationships.  Help!  Hi, Pheebs!  I didn\\'t know you were taking a class. That is so cool.  Well, what did the police say?  Ross, it\\'s just a sandwich!  Say Ross, when you picture Phoebe living on the street, is she surrounded by the entire cast of Annie?  What is going on here?  Yeah.  Oh—I don\\'t know.  Hey.  Ross?  Which I may say, right now, is out of control.  And you\\'re okay with that?  All right, look! Look. I think I can explain this.  Joey\\'s a sex addict.  Well let\\'s….let\\'s see what everybody thinks of that?  Are you sure Joe? Are you sure you\\'re not just a sex addict?  Yep! From now on its gonna be the four of you guys and me and the misses. The little woman. The wife. The old ball and chain.  The young hot ball and chain.  What’s up?  Listen, if you want to borrow money, its kind of a bad time. I’m buying dinner for 128 people tomorrow night.  But you’re still my friend?  During this time…are you, are you still my best man?  Do I still call you Ross?  So are we…friends again?  Yes, include more people in this.  Wait a minute! I have a date tomorrow night.  Well you don’t have to sound so surprised.  What?  Honestly? Me too.  Yeah. Y’know I keep thinking that something stupid is gonna come up and I’ll go all…Chandler. But nothing has.  Okay. I’ll be right there.  We’re the Bings.  Hi.  Hi…dad.  How did you guys find me? I knew I should’ve hid at the gym!  Panicking! And using the Internet to try to prove that I’m related to Monica. How is she?  No! No! No! I can’t do that!  Because if I go home, we’re gonna become the Bings! I can’t be the Bings!  The Bings have horrible marriages! They yell. They fight. And they use the pool boy as a pawn in their sexual games!  No.  It’s not just their marriage! I mean, look at yours. Look at everybody’s! The only person that can make marriage work is Paul Newman! And I’ve met me; I am not Paul Newman. I don’t race cars! I don’t make popcorn! None of my proceeds go to charity.  I want to. I love her so much, but I’m afr…It’s too huge.  Well yeah, but then…  Depends on what you mean by we.  No.  Yeah okay. Well, what’s the next little bit?  Yeah. You’re right. Hey I-I can do that.  Ross, I am not gonna run away again! I just want to get a little fresh air.  Okay.  Oh fresh air!  What?  I know about Monica.  Yeah, I heard you and Rachel talking.  You don’t know?  Monica’s pregnant.  Well I was! Then I went down to the gift shop because I was out of cigarettes…  But come on, look at how cute and small this is! So I got it to give Monica so she’d know I was okay.  Are you Joey?  Okay.  I do.  Our baby.  Phoebe found your pregnancy test in the trash.  Then…who did?  Hey.  And this from the cry-for-help department. Are you wearing makeup?  That\\'s so funny, \\'cause I was thinking you look more like Joey Tribbiani, man slash woman.  Do you know which one you\\'re gonna be?  Good luck, man. I hope you get it.  Yes, every single one of them.  I thought it was $98.50.  I\\'d just like to say that I\\'m totally behind this experiment. In fact, I\\'d very much like to butter your head.  All right, I\\'m nine years old.  We just finished this magnificent Thanksgiving dinner. I have--and I remember this part vividly--a mouthful of pumpkin pie, and this is the moment my parents choose to tell me they\\'re getting divorced.  Yes. It\\'s very difficult to appreciate a Thanksgiving dinner once you\\'ve seen it in reverse.  Tonight, on a very special Blossom.  Oh, you must stop shooping.  No, I prefer to keep a safe distance from all this merriment.  Ok, we all laughed when you did it with the stuffing, but that\\'s not funny anymore.  The most unbelievable thing has happened. Underdog has just gotten away.  No, no, the actual cartoon character. Of course the balloon. It\\'s all over the news. Right before he reached Macy\\'s, he broke free and was spotted flying over Washington Square Park. I\\'m goin\\' to the roof, who\\'s with me?  Come on. An 80-foot inflatable dog let loose over the city. How often does that happen?  Do either of you have the keys?  Ok, Monica, only dogs can hear you now, so, look, the door\\'s open. Here we go.  Now this feels like Thanksgiving.  Shall I carve?  Ok, who wants light cheese, and who wants dark cheese?  I\\'d like to propose a toast. Little toast here, ding ding. I know this isn\\'t the kind of Thanksgiving that all of you all planned, but for me, this has been really great, you know, I think because it didn\\'t involve divorce or projectile vomiting. Anyway, I was just thinking, I mean, if you\\'d gone to Vail, and if you guys\\'d been with your family, if you didn\\'t have syphilis and stuff, we wouldn\\'t be all together, you know? So I guess what I\\'m trying to say is that I\\'m very thankful that all of your Thanksgivings sucked.  Here, here!  I’m good.  Yuck!  That was like 5 years ago.  Joey…  Yes it was very sad when the guy stopped drawing the deer!  I’m not macho.  No, I guess I just never really cried. Y’know? I’m not a crying kind of guy.  I’d be sad sure, but I wouldn’t cry.  Cry?! I just found a talking puppy, I’m rich!  Oh, that’s Parent’s Day, first grade. That’s me with the janitor Martin.  Oh they didn’t want to come!  No! Look, I don’t cry! It’s not a big deal! Okay?!  You didn’t get more movies that are gonna have us reaching for the tissues all night did you?  Phoebe Buffay in Buffay: The Vampire Layer.  Hey, I had a terrible childhood and I don’t do porn.  Her ankle is what you’re watching?  She’s just doing her job!  There’s no back to this couch!  Yeah I know, but I figured a shot y’know? Maybe one of those stories would make me cry and then you wouldn’t think I was y’know, all dead inside.  Oh that makes me feel so warm in my hollow tin chest.  Yeah?  Okay, well I won’t uh, worry about this anymore then.  Aww, I love you so…  What?!  So you didn’t mean any of that?!  Hey.  Hey.  Well, I\\'m sorry Joe. I didn\\'t think the doctor was gonna buy that it just *fell* out of the socket.  Because the kids need new shoes.  Do I look fat?  Okay, I accept that. When Janice asked me and I said no, she took that to mean that I was calling her a cow.  Okay, well. Janice said \\'Hi, do I look fat today?\\' And I, I looked at her....  Okay, so you both just know this stuff?  That\\'s easy, baggage claim.  Okay, this is good, this is good. All right listen, I have one. Janice likes to cuddle, at night, which, you know I\\'m all for. But, uh, you know when you want to go to sleep, you want some space. So, uh, how do I tell her that without, you know, accidentally calling her fat or something.  Thank you Rachel.  Well, I thought you guys were cuddlily sleepers.  Yeah.  Okay, the old hug and roll.  Okay, one question.  You\\'re pretending the pillow\\'s a girl right?  Umm, not feeling better \\'bout Malcom.  Well, your gonna need much bigger jars.  That, that\\'s what\\'s stupid.  No, that\\'s all right. I just had a jar of mustard.  You mean there\\'s more than one of us.  And that\\'s how you bought it?  Pheebs, wake up and smell the restraining order.  Sure. What\\'s up?  Happy Valentine’s!  I love you, St. Valentine.  Woah, woah, that’s not pretty!  I am trying!  It’s yelling…bleeding…dilating. Oh, the dilating…  I thought…maybe…you got me porn for Valentine’s Day.  Well, I’m not really in a sexy mood right now.  Well, remember the first time we saw Jaws?  How long it took to go back in the water?  You don’t know. You didn’t see it.  90 seconds.  You know, it haunts me? Up ‘til now, the worst thing I ever saw, was my father doing tequila shots off the naked houseboy. After this, I would gladly make that my screensaver!  I can do that.  Okay. Now all we’ve got to do is get rid of this chair.  Oh, I know!  Poor Ross.  Oh, great. We have to watch him do yoga in his underwear, but for this he closes the drapes!  Oh, and we should warn you, before you watch it: don’t watch it.  Well, let’s just say it’s ironic how footage of someone being born can make you want to kill yourself.  Why have I seen this thing three times?!  Wait, you guys, look!  No, the baby’s out! Look, look!  And look how happy the mom is now!  How did the job stuff go?  Or facing a bitch of a commute.  Well, it makes me feel sad, but...  I see.  Is this the best way to use one of your three magic wishes?  We close escrow tomorrow, so seeing another house can only confuse us, and we\\'re easily confused. We\\'re not very bright.  What do you think Pheebs?  Yeah.  You\\'re kidding!  Oh yeah?  I know. *He* always wanted to be the first black man to cross the Atlantic.  Unless Snoopy says it to Charlie Brown, I think we\\'re okay.  It feels like we’re cheating on our house. And if we’re gonna cheat, shouldn’t it be with like a hot, younger house, that does stuff that our house won’t do?  And yet I never run into Beyonce!  This can not be happening!  The only way that that is going to happen, is if the other couple are the Hitlers.  That is a great idea! And by the way, I don\\'t mean to sound distasteful, but when did you start crapping money!?  Alright alright, we still have three hours till escrow closes on our house. We can still get out.  The Hitlers will be so disappointed.  Wait! I just want you to know that... I\\'m so happy you\\'re going to be here.  Because... that way... we can pick up where we left off.  I never stopped loving you.  Yeah, yeah, yeah! I want you... I need you... I must have you Janice Litman Goralnik Neihosenstein.  Now that you live next door, we can be together every day. Sid and Monica never have to know a thing.  Don\\'t say that. Don\\'t tangle the dream and take it away.  I understand.  Hey, that monkey\\'s got a Ross on its ass!  Might wanna open with the snowman.  Nothing for you, you have Paolo. You don\\'t have to face the horrible pressures of this holiday: desperate scramble to find anything with lips just so you can have someone to kiss when the ball drops!! Man, I\\'m talking loud!  It\\'s just that I\\'m sick of being a victim of this Dick Clark holiday. I say this year, no dates, we make a pact. Just the six of us- dinner.  Y\\'know, I was hoping for a little more enthusiasm.  Wait a minute, wait a minute, I see where this is going, you\\'re gonna ask him to New Year\\'s, aren\\'t you. You\\'re gonna break the pact. She\\'s gonna break the pact.  Yeah, \\'cause I already asked Janice.  I snapped, okay? I couldn\\'t handle the pressure and I snapped.  I\\'m not saying it was a good idea, I\\'m saying I snapped!  Too many jokes... must mock Joey!  Aah, y\\'killing me!  Y\\'know, if you\\'re gonna work late, I could look in on him for you.  Okay, but if he asks, I\\'m not going to lie.  Fun Bobby? Your ex-boyfriend Fun Bobby?  I happen to know a Fun Bob.  That\\'s so weird, I had such a blast with him the other night.  Yeah, we played, we watched TV.. that juggling thing is amazing.  With the balled-up socks? I figured you taught him that.  Y\\'know, it wasn\\'t that big a deal. He just balled up socks... and a melon...  You remember Janice.  Kill me. Kill me now.  Alright, Janice, that\\'s it! Janice... Janice... Hey, Janice, when I invited you to this party I didn\\'t necessarily think that it meant that we-  I\\'m sorry you misunderstood...  Ooh. Uh, I don\\'t know how to tell you this, but she\\'s in Monica\\'s bedroom, getting it on with Max, that scientist geek. Ooh, look at that, I did know how to tell you.  And the moment of joy is upon us.  Alright, somebody kiss me. Somebody kiss me, it\\'s midnight! Somebody kiss me!  They couldn’t be worse. I spent eight hours calling him last night, just trying to get him to talk to me.  Hey, by any chance did either of pick uh Rachel for your secret Santa, ‘cause I wanna trade for her.  Wow! Why do you want to get rid of her so badly?  Op, y\\'know what though, it’s kind’ve a girlie briefcase.  Hey, what time is it? The big game is about to start!  Thanks.  Monica got ice in her eye, and it hurts.  Well maybe you should put some ice on it.  He’s really picky about his patients.  Oh y’know what, I was already trying to trade for ah, well, you.  I don’t know R.G., I was thinking something girlie for your office.  Oh no-no-no, you don’t want to do that, then you’re gonna get stuck with Rachel and she exchanges every gift she ever gets.  Like?  When was the last time you saw her wear it?  Big dog?  I walk into a room and he won’t even talk to me, he just mumbles something in Italian. And I know he only knows the bad words.  Hey Joe.  Oh, uh, when-when are you coming back?  What?!  Hey, look, what do you want me to say? Do you want me to say that I’ll stop seeing her?  Hey, look, I know what it is to be a friend, I just-I just screwed up!  All right look, if you’re not gonna stay for me, then at least stay for them! Okay, they have had a very difficult year! What with the robbery and all!  What?  How do ya do.  What happened? What happened?!  Sorry!  Okay, okay, you got it!  You can’t tell, but I’m trying to break the tension by mooning you guys!  You’re right, and I’m sorry! This means a lot to me! I want you to be my friend again! I swear, I won’t say another word tonight.  Absolutely!  So?  Yeah?  Man, this is…  Honey, you remember my boss Doug right?  I didn’t know you and Carol were getting divorced, I’m sorry.  No.  Oh yeah. Boy, urine cuts right through an ice sculpture doesn’t it?  Oh uh, as it turns out, we can’t do it. Monica has to work.  Oh uh well tomorrow’s no good for her either.  It’s the semi-finals…of her…botchy ball tournament.  Well now-now you’re just talking crazy.  Because uh…we-we…we split up. Monica and I split up. Hold me.  Y’know what would really help me through this tough time is choking something. Can I choke ya?  Oh that’s all right sir, and that’s just one girl.  It’s a hand. It’s a thing you use as a Jack and Coke holder.  Oh no-no-no!  Hi honey I’m home.  It was awful. To get out of going to dinner with Doug I told him that you and I split up. So then he took me to all these strip clubs and sleazy bars, and then when I wouldn’t give him my wedding ring, he threw a soda can at a bird!  Y’know what the worse part was? I got to see what my life would be like without you. It was like It’s a Wonderful Life with lap dances. Please promise that you will never leave me, that we will grow old together, and be with each other for the rest of our lives.  Ooh, I don’t know if we’re there yet.  Are you, are you high?  Really? I don’t like baths.  Honey, it’s not the bath I enjoy, it’s the wet, naked lady.  Really? What do you do? You just sit in there stewing in your own filth.  Honey, it’s 2:00 on a Wednesday and I’m watching Road Rules, how stressed do you think I am?  Oh! Uh, yeah! Is this a cold pizza talk or a leftover meatloaf talk?  Oh my God, what’s up?!  Oh no-no, no you don’t, just come back.  Do you?  In London?  Yes. When Monica and I were in London, we were both in London.  If that.  Hey.  Sex on the balcony?  What is it?  Honey, I don’t like baths! Could you draw me a picture of us having sex on the balcony?  Well, this does butch it up a bit.  All right, if I do this, can we at least discuss sex on the balcony?  Oh my God.  I’m going to need a bigger boat.  I’m in the bathroom, can you come in here? I think there’s something wrong.  I’m in the bathtub.  I drew my own bath, but I did it wrong! The water’s tepid. The salt didn’t dissolve and is now… lodged places. And the scents I used don’t compliment each other. Eucalyptus and chamomile—Oh!  Yeah! Sure, sure. So, what was going on with you today? Oh-oh-oh!  I had the exact same conversation.  I don’t know! Joey hasn’t had this much trouble getting out words since we saw him in Macbeth!  All right, let’s break this down. What exactly did he say to you?  Uh-huh.  He didn’t say anything about that to me.  He was asking all these questions about you, me, and London. And, of course the glue that holds this all together, the rules.  But what did he mean by rules?  Because he was looking at her differently.  My God! He wants to do it with Phoebe in London!  You don’t say anything.  I’m not going to let you say anything.  Oh, God!  Do I smell essential oils?  Okay.  L-leaving my troubles behind?  Oh, it’s so hard to care when you’re this relaxed.  You like Rachel?!  I’ll…I’ll get you later!  Yeah. And what you’re doing feels so good.  You’re not?  Oh, sweet Lord. New realms of pleasure!  Hey!  I\\'ve got nowhere to go this morning. I\\'m unemployed! I don\\'t know what I\\'m gonna do with my life.  I mean, what am I supposed to do with myself?  But it\\'s all so overwhelming. I don\\'t know where to start.  Hey! This is where your hyper-organized-pain-in-the-ass stuff pays off!  How long was I in there?  Wait. Advertising! That\\'s a great idea!  I don\\'t think I have to hear the rest. Advertising makes perfect sense. Sorry you had to waste all this time, though.  I mean, I can write slogans. I mean, how hard can it be, right? \"Cheese. It\\'s milk that you chew.\" \"Crackers. Because your cheese needs a buddy.\" \"A grape. Because who can get a water melon in your mouth?\"  Honey? Leave it to the pros.  \"The phone. Bringing you closer to people...who have phones.\"  No, no. But let me show you what I can do. \"Bagels and donuts. Round food for every mood.\"  Really? That\\'s great!  It\\'s funny. When you said \"unpaid\" it sounded like you said \"unpaid.\"  Actually, we\\'re trying, and I don\\'t think Monica\\'s gonna wanna postpone it. We\\'re supposed to have sex tonight. Actually, she\\'s probably at home naked right now. I tend to keep talking until somebody stops me. I can just picture her on the bed right now.  Whatever I decide to do, I\\'m gonna be starting a career from scratch. It\\'s gonna be a while before I make a living at it. Maybe now is not the right time to be starting a family.  Yeah.  Yeah, Ross is here so...  Hey.  Oh, yeah. But you have to give it back if I get a job. Of course, by that time in the future ties will be obsolete and we\\'ll all be wearing silver jump suits.  Oh god, I have to tell you something. You\\'re not pregnant.  That thing that I have to do to make a baby. I faked it.  Oh yes you can. You just make the faces and the noises.  That\\'s actually why. Look, I\\'m starting a whole new career now, and I\\'m not saying that I don\\'t want to have a baby, I\\'m just saying maybe we could wait a little while.  Or a year?  Yeah, me too. Look, I\\'ll just get my old job back.  I quit and you learn what I do?  I guess. It\\'s always gonna be scary when we have a baby.  Should we go make a baby right now before you change your mind?  Oh, and I promise, I will not fake it this time.  Uh, if I were omnipotent for a day, I\\'d.. make myself omnipotent forever.  You got waaaay too much free time.  Happy birthday, pal!  Well, aren\\'t we Mr. \"The glass is half empty.\"  Eleven days before Halloween.. all the good costumes are gone?  You got it.  We\\'ll take a brief time out while Messier stops to look at some women\\'s shoes.  Yes, Bunny?  What? There was ice there that night with Carol? Plastic seats? Four thousand angry Pittsburgh fans?  He\\'s open!  Hey, look, we\\'re on that TV thing!  Yes, the moon, the glow, the magical feeling, you did this part- Could I get some painkillers over here, please?  Well, what? What? What is it? That she left you? That she likes women? That she left you for another woman that likes women?  Then what?  I think it\\'s great. Y\\'know, it\\'s sweet, it\\'s romantic...  Oh, I thought you were great in Silence of the Lambs. Oh come on, admit it! All things considered, you had fun tonight.  You gotta do it, man.  Hello? Oh, uh, Rachel, it\\'s the Visa card people.  What are you guys doing?  Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!!  Yes, Joey\\'s made arrangements to have his baby in a movie from the 50\\'s.  You have to pick your moments.  I used to have that bumper sticker.  Mmmm. Not tonight, honey. I got an early day tomorrow.  Oh, ok, \\'cause we never do that.  You\\'ll get one.  All right. I\\'ll tell you what. When we\\'re 40, if neither one of us are married, what do you say you and I get together and have one?  Oh, no, no. I just meant hypothetically.  No, no, no.  Rachel, what is the deal with you and doctors, anyway? Was, like, your father a doctor?  Where have you been?  Mazel tov!  I know, I still am one of these.  Hey Pheebs, what’s up?  Buy stamps, pick up dry cleaning…Don’t let Phoebe in.  Hey babe.  Who says you can’t get a nice punch bowl for under six bucks? Maybe we can take it back?  How about to the street say from the balcony?  Okay. How about in that cabinet?  Oh y’know, I’ve been living here a while and I’ve never seen what’s inside that closet. What is, what is in there?  Don’t try to make me uncomfortable with feminine stuff!  Fine.  Monica has a secret closet and she won’t let me see what’s in it.  I don’t know! What could she possibly be hiding in here that I can’t see?!  Why would Monica be keeping Richard in here?  And here we go…  There has got to be a way!  Maybe Monica has a bobby pin.  So, how’s the hideously inappropriate crush on Rachel coming?  That’s a good idea.  I married Fred Sanford!  No, honey you’re not sick! Look, I don’t love you because you’re organized, I love you in spite of that.  Yes! And look, now that I know if I got some extra stuff lying around can we, can we share the closet.  Hey.  So Rachel’s all moved out huh? How are you taking it?  Are you okay?  Oh! Right. Umm, maybe that’s because I didn’t send him an invitation.  I don’t even know the man. Okay? We’re not the close. I haven’t seen him in years.  Well he doesn’t have to know! It’s not like we run in the same circles. I hang out with you guys, and he stars in a drag show in Vegas.  Trust me, you don’t want him there either. Okay? Nobody is gonna be staring at the bride when the father of the groom is wearing a back-less dress.  What’s this?  Y’know we already went over this and I won!  Look forget it okay? I don’t want to go. I don’t want to see him. I don’t wanna.  No-no all kids are embarrassed by their parents, you’d have to come up with a whole new word for what I went through. When I was in High School, he used to come to all of my swim meets dressed as a different Hollywood starlet. Y’know it’s hard enough to be fourteen. You’re skinny. You’re wearing speedoes—That your mom promised that you would grow into! And you look up into the stands and there’s your dad cheering you on dressed as Carmen Miranda. We was wearing a headdress with real fruit that he will later hand out to your friends as a healthy snack!  He had sex with Mr. Girabaldi!  Does it matter?!  Yeah o-okay, but I’m just doing this for you.  So I really never get to win anymore?  No! No! I don’t want him to know we’re yet! I’m not sure I’m ready for that. And besides he’s not gonna be too happy to see me either.  I don’t know if I’ve told you this, but he’s kinda tried to get in contact with me a lot over the last few years  And there’s daddy!  Believe me, I’ve been saying that for years. Oh my God!  That’s Mr. Girabaldi playing the piano.  He’s coming into the audience. He’s coming into the audience.  It can’t happen like this. Okay? I’ll meet you back at the hotel.  Oh, they’re a hoot.  Actually Monica and I are engaged.  Wait! Wait! We’d really love it if you could be there.  I know it would make me happy, ma’am.  Yeah. Thanks for making me do this.  I think that’s the youngest girl ever to reject me.  Oh hey!  No. I mean I believe that uh, certain people are more suited for each other and I believe in falling in love, but soul mates, I don’t think they exist.  Why?  What?  A tall guy with hair similar to mine, oh unknowable universe!  Luckily, the guy she settled for can’t hear what you’re talking about.  You believe that this guy is destined for someone else and you’re still gonna date him?  What are you doing?!  I believe in tall, handsome strangers who hit on my wife!  Cheese you say? That’s some pretty smelly work, huh Don?  Cheese, it’s smelly. You must smell a lot of the time too.  Is it made of cheese?  What do we do?  Sure, why don’t you set it up. I’ll just be over here, browsing through the personals.  Yeah, fine. Fine. Not perfect!! But good enough.  I’m sorry, did you say cheese?  Phoebe thinks you and Don are soul mates, and I don’t believe in that kind of stuff. But then you two totally get along. So look, I won’t stand in your way if you want to run off with Don and live in a house of cheese.  You don’t?  So you…you don’t want to live with Don in a cheese house?  I love you.  Okay. Okay.  Hey! What are you guys doing?  I’m sorry, who?  But we don’t know the neighbors.  Wouldn’t it be easier if we just moved?  Eh, somebody’s in a good mood!  Hey, you cry every time somebody talks about Titanic!  Hey! So are you enjoying the bike?  Absolutely! Y’know, because touchie can mean both ass and good worker.  What is the matter with you?  Maybe, isn’t she the woman who lives below you and has sex really loud?  Y’know what would work?  Stop making candy!  You mean they like you.  Is that why you became a chef? So that people would like you?  Joey!  What are you doing?  All right, y’know what? Forget it, all of you forget it! You’ve ruined it! Go home! You’ve ruined it! You’ve ruined it!  No! Smokes-A-Lot Lady blew smoke directly into my mouth. Eh-uh—are you okay?  Hi!  How come?  Do you have any ideas?  Oh, well... Maybe I\\'ll join them some time. I just hope the club doesn\\'t slip out of my hand and beat the moustache off his face.  So how come Richard\\'s selling the place? Went bankrupt? Medical malpractice? Choked on his own moustache?  mmm That\\'s enough about you!  No, no, no, no, no, NO! No, no... we\\'re not together. We\\'re not a couple. We\\'re definately not a couple.  There\\'s a tape here with Monica\\'s name on it.  Don\\'t judge me, I\\'m only human!  I had to! Okay, imagine you were married... and you found a tape of your wife in another guys\\' apartment... Wouldn\\'t you need to know what was on it?  Some girl...!?  Yeah...!?  Then you\\'re gonna have to watch it for me.  Just for a few seconds, so I can know what it is... Please?  Why am I hearing cheering?  Football? Just football?  Whoho ho... Listen to the judgement from the porn star!  Because that\\'s who I am, okay? I\\'m sure a mature man like Richard could see a tape like that and it wouldn\\'t bother him. Just\\'d be another saucy anecdote for him to share at his men\\'s club over brandy and moustaches.  This is about you and Richard. He\\'s clearly not over you. He keeps a tape so he can... look at it whenever he wants.  Oh, yeah, well, poor Richard. Y\\'... I can grow a moustache!  Yeah, oh, but I just keep picturing you rolling around with him with your cowboy boots in the air...  Oh, good, good. Play more, \\'cause I wanna see how it ends.  What...? That\\'s not you! Life is good again! Ride \\'em cowgirl!  Is that a problem?  Yeah, we have all this paperwork that needs to be filed by the end of the year. If I don\\'t get it done, I\\'ll be fired.  So, who does?  I\\'m sorry, I won\\'t be here.  Did I not mention that?  Hey. Where\\'ve you been?  Well, that\\'s like money in your pocket! - Alright look, you want me to say it? This sucks. Being here sucks! This work sucks!  I\\'m sorry. Hey, at least you guys get to go home and be with your families tonight. I have to go back to an empty hotel room and lay down on a very questionable bedspread. And then tomorrow morning, you get to have Christmas morning in your own houses, wich, by the way, none of you have invited me to.  Haha, no thanks!  Oh, thanks! I\\'m... actually thinking about becoming a motivational speaker.  Typical Christmas-y stuff, you know? Our holidays are pretty traditional...  I can save you time ladies, I\\'m right here.  What? That\\'s terrible!  Oh well, that, that makes it not terrible.  No not okay, you can\\'t look for Monica\\'s presents!  No, you don\\'t have to, and you can\\'t because I, I live here too.  Why?  No, I have a great idea for a present for her.  If I help, we can find \\'em faster!  OK, Pheebs, your turn.  And, a lemon lime.  And last but not least.  Well, I\\'m here to see my old buddy Ben. What are you doing here, weird...turtle-man?  What?  You called everyone and said you were having trouble finding a Santa costume, so I borrowed one from a guy at work!  Why?  But I didn\\'t get to shake my belly like a bowl full of jelly.  Fine, I\\'ll give the suit back.  Santa? Really?  Did your Dad ever dress up like Santa?  You know what, everybody? Go home. You should be with your families. It\\'s bad enough that we\\'re working New Year\\'s Eve.  Did I not tell *anyone* about New Year\\'s Eve? -- Alright, look, go! Go home, okay? Merry Christmas! Go.  Ah. Thanks.  Ahh, Merry Christmas; I miss you guys!  Ah, well no, it\\'s just uh, me and Wendy.  It is. Did I... not tell you about her?  I sent them home.  Uhh, uh...  I don\\'t know!  I don\\'t think of her that way, you know, she\\'s a, she\\'s a colleague.  Oh, she\\'s regional Vice President; She\\'s... just below me.  BE-LOW me!  Well, she... she didn\\'t win...  Well, second prettiest that year; I mean, of *all* the girls in Oklahoma, she\\'s probably...  Honey, there\\'s really nothing to worry about.  I\\'m serious!  Merry Christmas.  Merry Christmas, you guys!  Ah well, she\\'s got this weird idea, that, uh, y\\'know, just because you and I are alone, that something is gonna happen.  This is probably the wrong thing to be worrying about, but... you\\'re getting ham on my only tie.  I\\'m *happily* married.  Right. So, I\\'m sorry...  Well look, it\\'s not easy to spend this much time apart, you know. She\\'s entitled to be a little paranoid... or, in this case: right on money! ... You know, she\\'s amazing, and beautiful, and smart, and if she were here right now, ...she\\'d kick your ass. Look, you\\'re a really nice person... ham stealing and adultery aside. But, what I have with my wife is pretty great, so nothing is ever gonna happen between us.  I mean, you were the most beautiful woman in the room tonight!  But we don\\'t do that.  How drunk are you?  What?  I know.  Okay!  It bodes well for me that speed impresses you.  Yep!  Count of three?  Two!  Well I think it\\'s safe to say that our friendship is effectively ruined.  So, are you really gonna go out with that nurse man?  Y\\'know, I don\\'t know if you\\'ve ever looked up the term goofing around in the dictionary... Well, I have, and the technical definition is, two friends who care a lot about each other and have amazing sex and just wanna spend more time together. But if you have this new fangled dictionary that gets you made at me, then we have to, y\\'know, get you my original dictionary. I am *so* bad at this.  Really? Okay, so...  Y\\'know, I sensed that I should stop. So we\\'re okay?  Right!  Oh, okay, I have condom in my wallet that I\\'ve had since I was twelve.  I don\\'t think so.  No, we\\'ll-we\\'ll bring it back! Just put it under your dress.  Ehh.  Look, I thought about it too, and I\\'m sorry. I think we should spend all of the money on the wedding.  Yeah, I\\'m putting my foot down. Yeah look, when I proposed I told you that I would do anything to make you happy, and if having the perfect wedding makes you happy, then, then that\\'s what we\\'re gonna do.  Eh, forget about the future and stuff! So we only have two kids, y\\'know? We\\'ll pick our favorite and that one will get to go to college.  Yeah.  Uh, four, a boy, twin girls and another boy.  Well, stuff like where we\\'d live, y\\'know? Like a small place outside the city, where our kids could learn to ride their bikes and stuff. Y\\'know, we could have a cat that had a bell on its collar and we could hear it every time it ran through the little kitty door. Of course, we\\'d have an apartment over the garage where Joey could grow old.  Sure you do.  You sure?  I love you so much.  Hey!  I wanted to be with you. I missed you so much.  Monica.  I never want to leave you again!  Turns out they can\\'t fire me. Because I quit.  Yeah! It\\'s a stupid job, and I could not stand leaving you. And why should I be the only one who doesn\\'t get to do what he *really* wants to do?  I know, I, I should have talked to you first about it.  Thanks!  I... thought it was a timely start to thinking about other people. Besides, this gift still says I love you guys.  I don\\'t have a *job*!  That’s great!  So you kissed her, so what happened after that?  So she’s just waiting over there for ya?  I’m not your garbage man. I’m your mailman.  You took off your pants and climbed under the sheets!  You made pottery?  Ahh, just like the apothecary tables of yore…  Look at us, we’re a couple of couples!  Oh that’s too bad.  That’s funny, I saw no phlegm.  Then why-why is she going to a play?!  Well, why does she not want to hang out with us?!  So she was just pretending to have a good time last night? She was lying to our faces?!  And I am not blah, I am a hoot!  No, you sh—No you said you made that up!!  Okay.  Okay, one more time.  Perfect decibel.  Hey.  Oh nothing, we’re just talking. Y’know, blah-blah-blah.  That’s totally understandable.  Oh yeah!  Did you hear that?  Hey so, did uh, did she move out?  You okay?  Hey.  I broke up with her.  They were huge. When she sneezed, bats flew out of them.  I\\'m tellin\\' you, she leaned back, I could see her brain.  You or me?  Maureen Rosilla.  Ok, Janice. Janice. You gotta give me Janice. That wasn\\'t about being picky.  Ok, Phoebe.  Uh-Oh. It\\'s Isaac Newton, and he\\'s pissed.  Actually, I think this apartment sullies the good name of crap  Hey, look at this. \"My Big Book of Grievances.\"  April 18th, excessive noise. Italian guy\\'s gay roommate comes home with the dry-cleaning. Well that\\'s excellent.  Wow, he looks so normal.  Funniest? Heckles?  Wow, Heckles was voted class clown, and so was I. He was right. Would you listen to that?  Whoa!  Heckles played clarinet in band, and I played clarinet. And he was in the scale modeler\\'s club, and I was, well, there was no club, but I sure thought they were cool.  I just think it\\'s weird, you know? Heckles and me, Heckles, and me, me and Heckles...Would you knock it off?  Look at this. Pictures of all the women that Heckles went out with. Look what he wrote on them. Vivian, too tall. Madge, big gums. Too loud, too smart, makes noise when she eats. This is, this is me. This is what I do. I\\'m gonna end up alone, just like he did.  Our trains are on the same track, ok? Yeah, sure, I\\'m coming up 30 years behind him, but the stops are all the same. Bitter Town. Aloneville. Hermit Junction.  What if I never find someone? Or worse, what if I\\'ve found her, but I dumped her because she pronounced it \"supposably\"?  How do you know that? How?  You\\'ll see, you guys are all gonna go off and get married, and I\\'m gonna end up alone. Will you promise me something? When you\\'re married, will you invite me over for holidays?  Yeah, I understand.  You know what? I\\'m not gonna end up like this. I\\'ll see you man.  Yes, Janice. Why is that so difficult for you to comprehend?  Yes. She was smart, she was pretty, and she honestly cared about me. Janice is my last chance to have somebody.  Oh, my, god!  Janice, you\\'re--  Is it--?  Congratulations.  You couldn\\'t have told me about this on the phone?  Neat. I\\'m gonna die alone.  Janice was my safety net, ok? And now I have to get a snake.  If I\\'m gonna be an old, lonely man, I\\'m gonna need a thing, you know, a hook, like that guy on the subway who eats his own face. So I figure I\\'ll be Crazy Man with a Snake, y=know. Crazy Snake Man. And I\\'ll get more snakes, call them my babies, kids will walk past my place, they will run. \"Run away from Crazy Snake Man,\" they\\'ll shout!  Of course I am. I reject anyone who\\'s crazy enough to actually go out with me, and then I bitch about the fact that there aren\\'t any great women out there.  In a bad way?  Whoa! Don\\'t know about that.  Hey. Well, you will all be pleased to know that I have a date tomorrow night. This woman, Alison, from work. She\\'s great. She\\'s pretty, she\\'s smart. And uh, I\\'ve been holding off on asking her out in the past, because she has an unusually large head. But, I\\'m not gonna let that stuff hang me up anymore. Look at me. I\\'m growing.  I\\'ll take that.  Yeah, yeah. Some people said some nice things about him. I think somebody should have it.  Takin\\' that with you, huh?  Yeah, jus\\' second. Good-bye Mr. Heckles. We\\'ll try to keep it down.  Wow, what a geek. They spent $69.95 on a Wonder Mop.  Well, that\\'s what we said about Joey...  How about Joey... Pepponi?  Joey... Switzerland?  Joe...Joe...Joe...Stalin?  Well, it does not ring a bell with me...  Might wanna try Joseph.  Oh yes! Bye Bye Birdie, starring Joseph Stalin. Joseph Stalin is the Fiddler on the Roof.  She\\'s not gonna make you wear one of those big plastic cones, is she?  So what does this mean?  I don\\'t get it, I mean, you just got him. How can he be an adult already?  I know that one! ...No, that\\'s Popes into a Volkswagen.  Yeah, but that\\'s like two blocks away from the beach. I mean, it\\'s a total party zoo.  What?  Ah. Your own brand of vigilante justice.  ...Take off their hats!  You\\'re kidding.  Y\\'know, you\\'d think I would\\'ve.  ...He\\'s in.  Okay, bye, champ. Now, I know there\\'s gonna be a lot of babes in San Diego, but remember, there\\'s also a lot to learn.  No Rach, it’s not just you. My thirtieth birthday certainly wasn’t that much fun.  Ross, a sports car? Wouldn’t it have been cheaper to just stuff a sock down there?  Hey-hey are you drunk?  Okay, here is the thing. We have thrown a very formal surprise party for you in there! All of your friends are in there and your parents!  Yes!  Yes!!  Okay, here’s the thing. We’re gonna get you some coffee and they will never know that you’re drunk.  Yeah, I’ll take care of it.  That’s still yours. Okay, now remember it’s a surprise party. So, when you go in, act surprised.  Okay.  Okay before we start the celebration, Monica has to go put on her party dress.  Monica’s a little drunk.  Monica’s wasted.  Okay, open ours next. Open ours next!  No-no-no-no! That was the joke!  No, because you’re not a grandmother!  Pheebs!!  What?  Okay, here we go.  Hey! How’d it go?  Well, here we are, just a bunch of thirty year olds.  Yeah, I think for us, kissing is pretty much like an opening act, y\\'know? I mean it\\'s like the stand-up comedian you have to sit through before Pink Floyd comes out.  The problem is, though, after the concert\\'s over, no matter how great the show was, you girls are always looking for the comedian again, y\\'know? I mean, we\\'re in the car, we\\'re fighting traffic... basically just trying to stay awake.  Oh, I think this is the episode of Three\\'s Company where there\\'s some kind of misunderstanding.  Yes, and we all know how cruel a parent can be about the flatness of a child\\'s pillow.  Ugly Naked Guy got a Thighmaster!  You don\\'t get a lot of \\'doy\\' these days...  ...Dinah?  Now, Monica, you know that\\'s not how you look for an engagement ring in a lasagne...  Boys? We\\'re going in.  Kinda puts that whole pillow thing in perspective, huh, Mon?  I mean presumably, the biggest part of your job is done.  What does she do?  Well, no, although I did have an imaginary friend, who... my parents actually preferred.  I dunno, but.. I think it\\'s about to attack the Enterprise.  You!  Oh, I can uh, check that for ya.  I can check that for ya.  Well… we-we do. You can only eat Tic Tacks in even numbers.  Okay, ten bucks says that we can name every item in that bag.  Yes!  Diet soda.  Orange juice.  Well, we used there’s up last night making scary faces.  All right! Ten buck! Fork it over! Cough it up! Pay the piper! Gimme it.  Fears and Pet Peeves.  His legs flail about as if independent of his body!  She has a real name.  Althea?! What are you doing?!  You\\'re shooting with Althea?!  Nice shooting!  Actually, it’s Miss Chinandolor Bong.  Unfortunately that is correct.  I majored in lightning rounds. All right, we’re gonna destroy you.  Well, I’m so confused as to what we’ve been doing so far…  Say 200?  But if we win, we get your apartment.  Dangerous Liaisons.  Fancy.  Fancy guest.  Thanks man.  You can’t just call Monica’s room.  Oh, I would never bet this apartment. It’s too nice.  Hey!  Yeah, but I bet it works.  Well believe it baby!  I knew it!  Cool, girl roommate.  Would you all stop yelling in our apartment! You are ruining moving day for us!  What?! What-what is it?!  I can’t believe we live here!  What\\'s this?  Well, I don\\'t know what Big Leon told ya but it\\'s an even thousand if you want me for the whole night. What is this for?  Well, thanks man. Now I can get my pony.  I don\\'t know. It\\'s a bracelet.  I so am.  Well, it\\'ll probably slow it down at first but, once I get used to the extra weight, I\\'ll be back on track.  Well, I\\'m guessing he wants to do a little dance. . . ya know, make a little love. . . well pretty much get down tonight.  Oh, she\\'s goin\\' somewhere.  Hey, you feelin\\' better?  That thing, it\\'s a uhh. . . yeah it\\'s, it\\'s a little flashy.  No, I\\'m alright, thanks.  Well, doesn\\'t the fact that I wore the bracelet even though I hated it say something about our friendship and how much it means to me?  I can\\'t believe it.  Hey.  Well this one\\'s for you.  That\\'s what they\\'ll call us.  Oh, I thought that\\'s what they used to cover Connecticut when it rained.  OK, I was wrong, that\\'s what they used to cover Connecticut.  Ahh, so how many cameras are actually on you?  Work on your music?  Hey, you know who used to have nails like that?  Isn’t this amazing?  Okay. Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  B-bye!  Yeah, I know, but all of those little annoying things she did before we fell in love? Like her voice, her laugh, her personality—Well, they’re all back! Y’know? And she’s picked up like nine new ones!  Yes, I-I know that you do, but I think one of the reasons people were complaining though, was that they paid to hear the actor sing Old Man River.  Right! I just think that this is happening too soon.  No! No! Not, Paris.  I don’t know exactly.  But I do know that it’s some time tomorrow.  Y’know uh, you didn’t really have to help me pack.  Well, I-I thought I did but, I-I guess I did not!  Oh, I’m packing. Y’know I’m-I’m packing ‘cause I’m moving to Yemen tomorrow.  I’m only going to pretend I’m moving to Yemen, it’s the only way I can get rid off her.  Y’know you, really didn’t have to take me to the airport.  Oh no-no-no, no. No, no, no, I just, I just need a pretend ticket.  What would you give to a kid if he wanted a ticket to play with?  Well, I-I guess I gotta go.  Well, just until we find an energy source to replace fuel.  Okay, good-bye. Good-bye.  No!  Janice! There you are! There you are! I had to have one last kiss, and also-also you said that you were going to leave right after I got on the plane!  Well, as old as he is in dog years, do you think Snoopy should still be allowed to fly this thing?  Excuse me little one, I have a very solid backhand.  I was shrieking... like a Marine.  Yes. Yes, and ah, ah, the trees are happy too, because for most of them, it’s the only chance to see New York.  Ahh, do you have any coconut flavoured deities?  How... exactly are you pursuing that? Y\\'know other than sending out resumes like what, two years ago?  He’s right, if you quit this job, you then have motivation to go after a job you really want.  Because, I’m too afraid.  Yeah, that’d be much worse than being 28, and still working here.  I spelled out boobies.  So, how many have you sold so far?  Oh my God, how did you do that?  Me! On my computer.  Eh, yeah, well ah, waitress at a coffee shop and cheer squad co-captain only took up so much room.  Something else I might have said?  You-you-you don’t wanna give into the fear.  Tell us what happened, Brown Bird Ross.  Y\\'know what Rach, maybe you should just, y\\'know stay here at the coffee house.  Well seeing that drunk Santa wet himself, really perked up my Christmas.  It’s like ‘Night of the Living Dead Christmas Trees.’  Sure, everybody loves a kidder.  I’m an alien. I’m an alien.  You know, I\\'d love to, but I\\'m a little tired.  You\\'re on!  He could be alone. This morning I heard him do push-ups, and then talk to his triceps.  She\\'s cheating on Joey with Ross!  Wow!  How about the dinosaur twins in the other room? No-one is manning that wall!  Anything?  You do realise that\\'s your brother?  That\\'s not true. I came with Monica and I\\'m leaving with Weird Al.  Okay Buckwheat!  And she\\'s... turning on the TV... and watching... Miss Congeniality!  You got it!  Okay, well we\\'ll go back in there, but will you do one thing for us? The people that care about you?  Enunciate!  Hey!  Not quite. Monica\\'s still at the salon, and I\\'m just finishing packing.  You\\'re not supposed to take that. Besides, it\\'s a New Testament, what are you gonna do with it?  Hey!... aaaaaahhhh!  I think.... I think I can see your scalp.  What d\\'ya know... It\\'s a treat for the eyes and the ears.  Yeah, it\\'s almost if Air Barbados doesn\\'t care about your social life.  Wish I could switch with someone. I really don\\'t wanna sit with Allen Iverson over there.  You go back to work tomorrow night, right?  So if you want people to see them, then by definition you\\'re not having them taken out... say, at the break of dawn?  What are you singing?  It\\'s \"Ride of the Valkyries\" from \"Apocalypse Now\"... See, here\\'s the thing: The corn rose were really a solution to your frizzy hair problem. And now that we\\'re home, we don\\'t have that problem anymore, so if you think about it... I hate them!  Did I? Let\\'s refresh. I believe what I said was that I could see your scalp.  Again, let\\'s journey back... As I recall what Rachel said, was she had never notice the shape of your skull before. And Joey... Well, Joey didn\\'t realise that there was anything different.  Hit yourself in the tooth?  Honey, you\\'ve been in there for a long time... Is everything okay?  Really? What happened?  You can\\'t move at all?  If I untangle you, will you please get rid of the corn rose?  Now that I untangled you, how \\'bout you doing a little something for me?  I think you know.  This is what I want to do.  \\'Cause he was just so darn cute.  Hey, what did your agent say?  And I\\'ll be using his dead body as a shield.  I may have.  Well, we haven\\'t exactly met, we just stayed up all night talking on the internet.  I like this girl, okay, I seriously like this girl, you now how sometimes I tend get a little defended and quipy...  Well she totally called me on it, okay. She said, \\'cut it out, get real\\', and I did.  It\\'s like this, me, no jokes.  Well, I think you should seriously consider the marriage thing, give Rachel another chance to dress up like Princess Bubble Yum.  Joey, no means no!  I\\'m sorry we, we don\\'t have your sheep.  I\\'m afraid I might just be.  Okay, it\\'s not a guy, all right, I know her.  How do you not fall down more?  I can\\'t believe she\\'s married.  What\\'s wrong? What\\'s wrong? You\\'re married that\\'s what\\'s wrong.  What?  Hey, look, Phoebe I wanted to meet her in person too, okay, but she\\'s married, she has a husband.  Okay, I\\'ll do it!  Hey!  I’ll give up my ticket.  And I think Ross is generous too.  Hey!  Ross.  Phoebe and Rachel! So the people that knew about our wedding before me were you, Phoebe and Rachel, Heldi, and apparently some band called Starlight Magic 7 who are available by the way!  Okay.  Yes, if it really doesn’t mean anything, because you know that I’m just not ready…  Totally.  Yeah, it’s beautiful.  I know.  Oh my God!  I’m gonna miss being able to afford food.  Yeah well, too bad we’re gonna have to return them.  I have you.  Hey-hey.  Now sweetie, I know you don’t like my office parties, but you can wear your new boots. See? Every cloud has a…supple leather lining.  Why not?  Do you think I work at some kind of boot pricing company?  You said that you paid all that money because those boots go with skirts, dresses, and pants!  Okay.  Y’know, that party wasn’t bad.  I don’t see any uh, cabs. Maybe we should just walk?  What honey, it’s like fifteen blocks to the subway. Let’s go.  What’s going on?  What?  Hop on.  Honey, I know you’re in pain right now, but I’m a little turned on.  Okay, ten blocks down. Five to go.  Oh I’m sorry! Do you need a break?  I can see it from right here. It’ll cost you one husband.  Well, why don’t you check in one of my saddlebags while I chew on a bale of hay!  Honey, are you seriously ever gonna wear the boots again?  Y’know what? You can say goodbye to the tan ones.  You\\'re flingin\\'-flangin\\' right I am!  Well, it\\'s official there are no good movies.  Hey, man. What\\'s up?  Well, I\\'ll tell ya I do enjoy guilt, but, ah, it wasn\\'t me.  Is anybody else scared?  Get the woman a pad! Get the woman a pad! A pad! A pad!  Okay, last night at dinner, when the meals came, she put half her chicken piccata on my plate and took my tomatoes.  Noo.  No, it\\'s like all of the sudden, we were this couple. And this alarm started going off in my head: \\'Run for your life! Get out of the building!\\'  Look what do I do? I wanna get past this, I don\\'t wanna be afraid of the commitment thing. I wanna go through the tunnel, to the other side!  You think?  Yeah, Joe, I assure you if I\\'m staring down the barrel of a gun, I\\'m pretty much peeing every which way.  Yes, I did. Yes, I did. Because, you\\'re my girlfriend, and that\\'s what girlfriends should, should get.  Well, not me. But that\\'s what\\'s happened, and, ah, and, and there\\'s more. We should take a trip.  Yep, we\\'re a couple and that\\'s what couples do. And, I wanna meet your parents. We should take a trip with your parents!  I am, I actually am. I mean this is amazing. My entire life I have feared this place, and now that I\\'m here it\\'s like what was the big deal. I could probably say \\'Let\\'s move in together.\\' and I\\'d be okay.  It doesn\\'t scare me!  So, I finally catch up to her and she says this relationship is going to fast and we have to slow down.  Then I got all needy and clingy.  She said she\\'d call me.  Oh God.  This ice cream tastes like crap by the way.  So, you don\\'t think I\\'m terminal?  Okay, okay. So, should I call her?  So I\\'m not, not gonna lose her?  I said, \\'So I\\'m not gonna lose her?\\'  Well, I\\'m sorry if my friends aren\\'t as sophisticated as yours.  Here in Chelsea.  A woman\\'s  Can I be that guy?  ....And then I just, you know, threw the bag of barley at her, and ran out of the store.  I\\'ve actually ruined this haven\\'t I? It\\'s time for the good ice cream now, right?  Hello!  Ahh, Hotties of the Paleontology Department, there’s a big selling calendar, eh?  A hot girl’s at stake and all of the sudden he’s Rain Man.  Oh, is that against the rules?  I see.  Oh yeah, Dana Keystone. She was in my Movement class.  Oh, I don’t know man. I haven’t talked to her in like ten years.  You do owe me so much. You owe me three thousand, four hundred…  Oh okay, I’ll-I’ll try.  Yeah so, Tuesday?  You just thought of that in there?  What are you smiling about? What is so funny?  How’s your room Rach?  Have you figured out what started the fire Mr. Fireman?  God, it’s great to catch up! I can’t believe how long it’s been!  Hi.  Honey, it is not a date! I haven’t talked to her in ten years! You can’t just call up somebody you haven’t talked to in ten years and ask them for a favor. There are rules, y’know? You gotta, you got to put in some time.  No, we only went out once.  Not once!  Yeah, I’ve always hated that Howie.  The nerve huh?  Refill?  I couldn’t do it.  Hey, relax I just need more time. We’re going to dinner tonight.  Uh, Dana Keystone from college.  No, that was Dana Caplin.  Great story again! The yarns that you weave! Woo-hoo-hoo!  Oh no-no-no! Stay! Stay! Because you-you should you-you-you should stay!  Oh no-no-no, that’s not—No-no-no!  No-no—Really?!  Well maybe there is one thing you can do.  Well, I umm, I mean this is just off the top of my head now, umm but I have this friend. This actor friend and he would kill me if he thought I was doing this umm, but umm would it be possible for him to get an audition for your movie say on Thursday?  Really?  Hey!  So?!  It’s Thursday! How was the audition?!  What?  Okay, let me just jump in and ask, at what point did you think this was a successful marriage?  Ross, just for my own piece of mind, you’re not married to anymore of us are ya?  You left a shoe here?!  Oh good, when he comes back for his keys, I’ll be sure to give him your shoe.  Whoa-whoa-whoa! What?  Yeah, I’m gonna pass. ‘Cause I was kinda iffy when it was puppies.  See that’s where I think that you’re wrong. We’ve been playing these babies man for man; we should really be playing a zone defense.  Okay, I’m a rookie. I should not be in the end zone.  Hey!  Shocking! Since you still have the keys.  What equity investments?  You don’t even have a car!  And?  There you are.  He can do more than that! He can destroy the universe!  They’re not gonna swallow anything, you guys are being way over protective. When I was a kid, my mom used to just throw me into a pile of broken glass!  I swallowed the sonic blaster gun.  But you found the keys to his clothes?  That is true.  Ahh, I think it just moved. It’s really poking me.  I think that’s gum.  Okay, listen this really hurts. Let’s go.  Well, let’s just say that Krog will be fully equipped to destroy the universe again in twelve to fourteen hours.  And protected them from a tornado?  Was the setting of Phoebe’s triumph.  Is not as important as the fact that Phoebe took care of the babies all by herself.  Ohh. Mmm.  Hey, you have got to try this cheesecake.  I—no! I didn\\'t read the box before I opened it. And you can\\'t return a box after you\\'ve opened the box.  Because it\\'s too delicious.  So…  Oh, what’s at 8:00?  Well, maybe since the age of 9, Frannie’s made some new friends.  Another cheesecake came! They delivered it to the wrong address again!  I can’t seem to say goodbye.  Well I’ve forgotten what it tastes like okay?!  Good idea. Where do you want to go to lunch?  Well, thank you for lunch.  By then, the cheesecake may have gone bad. We don’t want her to come back to bad cheesecake.  Well, we don’t want that.  But we should take it.  Why?  I’m full, and yet I know if I stop eating this, I’ll regret it.  What are you doing tonight?  Oh really? Uh, Monica said she had a date at 9:00.  That’s what Monica said.  Are you eating the cheesecake without me?!  Oh yes!  Oh yes!  Oh yes! Oh yes!  Well that’s not fair, you’ve already had some!  What do we use to split it?  Stick to your side!  What are you crazy? That\\'s a baby!  Hey, you\\'re gonna be fine. You\\'re one of the most caring, most responsible men in North America. You\\'re gonna make a great dad.  Well, only if you order stuff.  There it is! So what\\'re you gonna do?  And your friend Phoebe?  Man, if you tried something like that on my birthday, you\\'d be starin\\' at the business end of a hissy fit.  Alright, what have we learned so far?  Did you see Betty?  Okay, worst case scenario. Say you never feel like a father.  Say your son never feels connected to you, as one. Say all of his relationships are affected by this.  You know, you think I would.  What\\'s up with the simian?  No, no, you got zero points for \\'IDNEY\\'.  Marcel swallowed a Scrabble tile.  We think he was trying to spell out \\'MONKEY.\\'  Hey, come on, you came through, you did what you had to do. That is very dad.  So he has to be a male who has at least $50.  So, why is she leaving? Is it a school night and she has a lot of homework to do?  Oh, tell her good luck with that.  Yeah. Do we have any Fruit Roll-Ups?  Oh that’s so funny because we found someone too.  Why would our guy be a weirdo?  A face ass?  No, our guy is just a floating head.  Our guy has great hair.  Our guy smells incredible.  Hey.  Well, you…don’t look good Joe.  That’s still in there?!  Is this a service you’re providing me?  Our new fridge? I don’t live here anymore.  Uh-huh.  Just tell her the truth! Tell her you’re not ready.  Then you distract her with a Barbie doll.  Joey, I saw you push him!  Uh-huh.  Hey!  Yeah.  Are you sure?! Because our guy smells incredible!  Are you funny?  Yeah, but Sebastian? What is that? A cat’s name?  Okay, so you will meet our guys?  Okay now it doesn’t matter which one you choose, y’know? It’s completely up to you. Our guy is perfect, or you can go out with the guy Phoebe deemed not good enough to go out with herself.  You know the hotels?  Well, maybe you don’t marry this one.  Good-good-good-good.  Hey!  So what was it for anyway?  Yeah.  All right Joey, be nice.  So does he have a hump? A hump and a hairpiece?  Sounds like a date to me.  Alright, so I\\'m back in high school, I\\'m standing in the middle of the cafeteria, and I realize I am totally naked.  Then I look down, and I realize there\\'s a phone... there.  That\\'s right.  All of a sudden, the phone starts to ring. Now I don\\'t know what to do, everybody starts looking at me.  Finally, I figure I\\'d better answer it, and it turns out it\\'s my mother, which is very-very weird, because- she never calls me!  Cookie?  Please don\\'t do that again, it\\'s a horrible sound.  Ooh, this is a Dear Diary moment.  I\\'m sorry, I didn\\'t catch your name. Paul, was it?  It\\'s a beautiful thing.  I would have to say that is an \\'L\\'-shaped bracket.  I have no idea.  All finished!  Yes, please don\\'t spoil all this fun.  Oh, God.  Oh my God!  Look, Ross, you gotta understand, between us we haven\\'t had a relationship that has lasted longer than a Mento.   You, however have had the love of a woman for four years.   Four years of closeness and sharing at the end of which she ripped your heart out, and that is why we don\\'t do it!  I don\\'t think that was my point!  Angela\\'s the screamer, Andrea has cats.  That is amazing.  If can invade Poland, there isn\\'t anything I can\\'t do.  Hi, Paul, is it?  All right, kids, I gotta get to work. If I don\\'t input those numbers,... it doesn\\'t make much of a difference...  \\'Look, Gippetto, I\\'m a real live boy.\\'  And yet you\\'re surprisingly upbeat.  Oh, how well you know me...  Did you make it, or are you just serving it?  Okay, so, I\\'m in Las Vegas... I\\'m Liza Minelli-  Wow, it\\'s, it\\'s like porno for clowns.  Or maybe she doesn\\'t steal stuff and Joey just slept with her and never called her back.  Ya know, my cousin went to hell on a football scholarship.  Why her mom?  Excuse me?  This isn\\'t your first surprise party, is it sir?  So, basically just a Chinese guy.  Yes because uh, you look so young.  NO! No, I\\'ll take that for ya.  Ok, think, what would Jack and Chrissy do?  Uhh, yes, absdolutely, um. Why again?  Yeah, this more than anything else, is the staging area.  Well, we could count again.  Look, are you gonna be ok?  Well, actually just one birthday flan.  It\\'s a traditional Mexican custard dessert...Look talk to Monica, she\\'s on the food committee.  Joey, Joey. Hey, some girl just walked up to me and said, \\'I want you Dennis,\\' and stuck her tounge down my throat. I love this party.  Volleyball.  Joey, a woman just stuck her tounge down my throat, I\\'m not even listening to you.  Well, I relied on a carefully regimented program of denial and, and wetting the bed.  Becasue it reminded you of the way our forefathers used to bitch at each other?  Well, uh, Dr. Greene, where are you going?  Sorry, we\\'re on a major flan high.  Yup, get ready for the gelatenous fun.  No-no-no-no, I\\'ve supported you one hundred percent and I want to prove that to you in person!  Forgive me? You haven\\'t been taking my calls in a week!  Uh, what was that?  I know. Can you believe it? One year ago today I was just your annoying friend Chandler.  Huh.  Oh, but it\\'s not \\'til tomorrow!  Okay.  Wow!  Do we have to?  Okay this is great, but Joey said he didn\\'t want any of us out there.  Yeah, I think we should see other people.  Yes.  I said art lover.  I don\\'t know, I\\'m very tired.  So it\\'s pretty much the same Pheebs.  Yeah, I guess it\\'s a little better now.  Can I give you a present now?  How do you feel about the, \"I really did forgot the present, please forgive me\" not fake out?  Ohh that\\'s the worse thing that can happen on an anniversary ever!  What-what Richard thing?  What Richard thing?  Oh my God.  Love your condoms my man.  Why?! What happened?!  No-no, that\\'s okay, apparently there\\'s a new policy where we don\\'t have to share everything with everybody.  No! Her boyfriend Richard!  When you go lunching with hunky moustache men and don\\'t tell me about it!  There\\'s not gonna be a next time! You can not ever see him again!  That\\'s so funny, because I think I just did!  Fine with me!  What are you talking…  Really?  Whoa!  Good luck!  I see.  What\\'s an identical hand twin?  Again I must go back to, how?  No! No! I support you 100%! I just didn\\'t, I didn\\'t get it right away. Y\\'know now I\\'m caught up! Identical hand twins! It\\'s a million-dollar idea!  No!  That was Joey!  Yeah, well, she\\'s probably talking to Richard.  Really?  What does it look like? I\\'m going home.  Really?!  Yeah, I wanted to make a dramatic scene, but I hate packing.  Yes! I\\'ve-I\\'ve never seen a roll like this in my life!  Okay, ah umm, ah, a 8. Ah, a 6?  8. 8!  If you get this one, we buy everybody here a steak dinner!  Noo!  Ahh, ooh, try a hard 8.  Two fours.  Another hard 8.  You roll another hard eight and we get married here tonight.  Yes! I love you! I\\'ve never loved anybody as much as I love you.  Okay, so if an eight comes up, we take it as a sign and we do it! {Whoa! Where have I heard that before? Matthew Perry talking about signs in Las Vegas. I guess it must\\'ve been some movie I saw.} What do you say?  Okay! Come on! Let\\'s go! All right!  All right!  Here it is! Here it is!  It\\'s a four.  Ohh, great, I have condom in my wallet I\\'ve had since I was twelve.  I don\\'t think so.  No, we\\'ll-we\\'ll bring it back! Just put it under your dress.  Hello! One marriage please!  Oh, that\\'s The Wedding March. Does, does that freak you out?  I didn\\'t know it was a big secret.  You bitch.  C\\'mon, there\\'s nothin\\' to see, it\\'s just a tiny bump, it\\'s totally useless.  Joey was in a porno movie.  If I\\'m goin\\' down, I\\'m takin\\' everybody with me.  Why yes Ross, pressing my third nipple opens the delivery entrance to the magical land of Narnia.  Huh? Are, uh, any of these cultures, per chance, in the tri-state area?  No, no the gravel capades. Yeah, the turns aren\\'t as fast but when Snoopy falls. . . funny.  Oh I see, I see, because of the third nipple thing. Ha ha ha ha. . .  Uh, Julie.  Sorry, you had a paleontologist on your face. But, uh, it\\'s gone now, you\\'re alright.  What\\'s this in my pocket? Why it\\'s Joey\\'s porno movie.  OK, now wait a minute. That is the craziest typing test I\\'ve ever seen.  Nice work my friend.  Well, listen, this has been great but I\\'m officially wiped.  I got the time to get to know Julie.  I\\'m goin\\' home.  So did Monica tell you about this great band called the Swing Kings that we’re trying to get to play at the wedding?  Oh since forever! I used to go all over town listening to bands!  Do you want me to call?  Staying out of the way.  Sure! That’s one of the great things about being engaged. I’m not nervous talking to pretty girls anymore.  So Ross, how was your date the other night? Did you tell her about the magical ride that starts with the flush of every toilet?  Huh.  Hey!  Uh Joe, when it’s one o’clock in the morning and you don’t come by? That’s okay!  Really? Right across the street?  When’d you meet her?  Excellent! Y’know Ross met somebody too!  Hi! How’d it go?  But I love swing music!  Look all I know is when Monica and I went to see them, we had fun! And there’s another reason too.  I don’t want to say.  Well it’s just while Monica and I were dancing to them it was…the first time I knew that…you were the woman I wanted to dance all my dances with.  Hi, honey! I’m home!  Why? Do you another boyfriend in there or something?  Y’know it’s funny I started it but, now it’s scary me. So could you come out here please?  Oh you got a wedding dress? That’s great!  Well then why can’t I see it?  Yeah, that’s like the most ugliest dress I’ve ever seen. Wh-why do you to return it?  Oh that’s great! Great! Thanks! But that dress I mean it’s like yuck! It’s terrible! It makes me wanna just rip it right off of you!  Okay!  Oh, uhm... I have to work too. Yeah, I\\'m stuck at the office all day.  Those are all really old!  Hi!  I was in the car with Nancy all day.  Well, at least the perfume is not mine, be thankful for that!  It’s perfect. It’s everything we’ve been looking for.  And the fireplace in the bedroom.  This is bringing out a lovely color in you!  I don’t know. What do you think?  I do too.  I know.  I don’t know what you mean, giant talking cigarette! Oh, by the way, Phoebe called just as I was getting into Nancy’s car, so if she asks you, I was at work all day.  We don’t. Not until it\\'s a hundred percent. I mean, why upset everybody over nothing.  I know. Gooooood luck with it.  Hey!  Is it me, or have the greetings gone downhill around here?  ...and a street where our kids can ride their bikes and maybe an ice-cream truck can go by.  Actually, we already found a house we love.  Bet you wish I was having an affair now, huh?  I know this is really hard and we\\'re really sorry.  Hey, that\\'s...\\'joincidence\\' with a \\'C\\'!  If you win, we give up the birds.  But if we win, we get your apartment.  Dangerous Liaisons.  Fancy.  Fancy guest.  Thanks man.  Would you all stop yelling in our apartment! You are ruining moving day for us!  Well, I think, I think Ross knows about me and Monica.  Look, we\\'re not just messing around! I love her. Okay, I\\'m in love with her.  Sure!  Little toast here. I know this isn\\'t exactly the kind of Thanksgiving that all of you all planned, but for me, this has been really great, you know, I think because it didn\\'t involve divorce or projectile vomiting. Anyway, I was just thinking, I mean, if you\\'d gone to Vail, and if you guys\\'d been with your family, if you didn\\'t have syphilis and stuff, we wouldn\\'t be all together, you know? So I guess what I\\'m trying to say is that I\\'m very thankful that all of your Thanksgivings sucked.  Here, here!  Hello? It\\'s Nancy, they responded to our offer.  I know.  That\\'s okay, we understand.  Yeah... Well, it\\'s a good thing we got it then.  We got the house.  I just didn\\'t want to tell you in front of them.  We\\'re growing up.  So who\\'s gonna tell them?  Not it! Damn it!  You\\'ll see.  Well, I didn\\'t know how to tell you before, but... We got the house.  Yeah, because if I was at my old job we\\'d say 300 million? No thank you!  Still on Amelia Earhart?  Yes but there\\'s six of us so we\\'d only have to get struck by lightning 7 times.  Kinda like Joey.  Pie eating contest?  No, I saw a picture of you covered in blueberries.  One of the slots got filled.  Sense the tone! No that kid Nate got it.  Yeah I know.  Yeah...I mean I want this so much! I mean, I wanna get one, I want my friend Charlie to get one...Except I don\\'t care about Charlie.  I can see the headline now: \"Lottery winners\\' friend filled with regret eats own arm\".  Well you wouldn\\'t, but we own the paper, we can print whatever we want.  Ok, so now that you\\'re in, what are you gonna do if we win?  Ooh! Calm down ...  You know, I\\'m not sure a sports team is the way to go.  You\\'re right, it has been you dream for over 15 seconds.  Well no, Charlie\\'s gonna get that.  He\\'s the boss\\'s son.  What about the ones you have on the nightstand?  Yes there are, I just saw them a few minutes ago.  Honey, there are like 20 tickets on the nightstand!  Oh, yeah! Thanks for inventing the lottery!  Can I come a little bit closer, valuable things are getting squished...  This is..shhh!  Oh, is she related to Ralph Lauren?  I got that!  No.  Oh no no no no, I\\'d love to be somebody\\'s assistant! Answering phones, getting coffee, I live for that stuff! And I\\'m not too mature... farts, boobies, butt cracks!  Me, that guy who just said butt cracks?  Does that mean I get the good loving tonight?  Thanks, man.  Really? What?  Wow, you\\'d think we should get that over 20 years or go for the big payout.  Me too.  Yeah, it’s two guys in a ring, and the rules are: “They’re are no rules.”  Yes, but there’s two in martini, soo everybody back to my office.  Oh it’s Bing, sir. I’m sorry , I was just ah...  Thank you! Today, my boss keep slapping my butt and he was acting like it was no big deal.  Well, I didn’t do anything. I didn’t want to be the guy who has a problem with his boss slapping his bottom.  Yeah, I know, for a really great stew you just y\\'know, stick your head in between ‘em.  Well, that’s not true, he-he smacked you once.  No sir.  Nine times! Okay, I had to put on lotion! But, it’s gonna be okay, because as of tomorrow I’m conducting an experiment, and if all goes as planned, my butt will be smack free.  No, I ah, I didn’t do them.  No, no I just ah, didn’t do them. Instead, I ah, hung out with a couple of friends and had a couple of beers so I certainly don’t deserve any praise, verbal or otherwise.  Doug!!  I’m a little bit uncomfortable with the that way you express yourself.  No, no. It-it’s not about the swearing, it’s more about ah, the way, that you ah, occasionally, concentrate, your enthusiasm on my buttock.  Oh, and don’t get me wrong, I appreciate the sentiment. It’s just that I, I have a rather, sensitive posterior, and ah, besides, it’s making all the other guys jealous.  Thank you, sir.  No. No, not at all, that’s-that’s ridiculous.  Ye-ye-yeah, yes I do!  Run! Run you crazy, rich freak!  This coming from the man who couldn’t split our 80 dollar phone bill in half.  Hey, what are you doing here? Shouldn’t you be at work?  I’m so sorry you’re sick.  I’m gonna grab you some tissue.  Yes?  Oh my God, introduce us!  Yeah, I don’t you should say that even when you’re healthy.  Don’t take this personally okay? It’s just that I just can’t have sex with a sick person.  That’s the thing, see I would like to stay in the pribe of mwha-ah-libe.  Oh Jeez honey, I thought, I thought you were asleep.  Would you please get some rest!  Really? Struck down in the pribe of libe!  No-no-no-no-no-no-no, you are not getting me this way.  No-no-no-no-no!  Okay.  So you’re just, kinda rubbing it on yourself?  It’s nice.  Oh come on you big faker!  Well that was before all the vaporizing action.  We got some Vap-O-Rub in some places.  He’s taking off her coat!  Well, how do you find clothes that fit?  Ok, that\\'s Eric.  Ok, this could be tough.  Ooh, you almost had it.  Hey.  Your boyfriend is so cool.  Yeah, he let us drive his Jaguar. Joey for 12 blocks, me for 15.  I think they get it.  There\\'s the man.  Just tryin\\' somethin\\' here, ya know.  Hey listen, we\\'ve gotta go, I promised Richard we\\'d meet him downstairs.  Yeah, didn\\'t he tell ya?  You hear that? We\\'re the guys.  Uh, yeah, I just got my pick-up sticks back from the shop. Bring your nerves of steel.  Kick save and... denied.  Oh really, I didn\\'t know they had foosball in the 1800\\'s.  See, that\\'s why we don\\'t let her play.  Oh hey listen, don\\'t be mad at him, it\\'s our fault. I\\'m sorry we\\'ve been hoggin so much of his time.  No.  Your just, your just clearly not familiar with our young persons vernacular. See, when we say dad, we mean buddy. We mean pal.  No no, seriously, Joey\\'s my dad, Monica\\'s my dad. I\\'ve even got some dads down at work.  You\\'re not a dad. You\\'re not a dad.  Hey.  Monica and I are engaged.  Thanks.  To Monica!  So when you said, \"Get up early,\" did you mean 1986?  Okay.  Know what I mean?  There’s gonna be a wedding. You’re gonna be the bride. Two hundred people are going to be looking at you in a clean white dress.  You look great!  You okay over there?  Oh, don’t worry about it I mean you probably were tired, you had a lot of champagne, it happens to everybody.  Yes, on a scale from 1 to 10, 10 being the dumbest a person can look, you are definitely 19.  Young! You’re a man-child okay?! Now go get changed because everybody’s ready and please, oh please, keep my underwear!  Joe?  Uhh, you’ve had a lot of sex right?  Well, it’s just the reason that I’m asking is because I kind of eh, uh, I was unable to—I mean I really wanted too, but I couldn’t…. There huh—hmm, there-there was an incident.  It’s happened to you?  Well, what’d you do?  What?!  Yes, you can pass for 19.  Yes!  Seriously? Seriously, no! You can play your own age which is 31!  Now Monica, I know you’re upset, but don’t forget. There is going to be a wedding, you are going to throw the bouquet, and then there’s going to be a honeymoon, maybe in Paris.  Then we will sprinkle rose pedals on the bed and make love. Not just because it’s romantic, but because I can!  Okay, don’t say anything, you might scare it away.  It’s Paris, who knows we’re here!  Pheebs, we’re not giving you a deposit for our wedding!  Oh, give her the deposit! Give her the ring! I don’t care!  How is that ever going to happen?!  Thanks.  It could’ve been worse, he could’ve shot her.  Hey.  Oh wow, I hope you don’t take this the wrong way but, I know we had plans to meet up tonight and, ugh, I’m just kinda worried about what it might do to our friendship.  Seven times!  In a foreign, romantic country…  Well, I don’t see that we have a choice. But, when we’re back home, we don’t do it.  Y’know, I saw a wine cellar downstairs…  Okay!  Forget it, that’s off.  The man’s got a point.  Listen, in the middle of everything if I scream the word, \"Yippee!\" just ignore me.  Oh, hello Rachel.  Yes, we do. But, we have to change first.  Yeah, we’ll be down in like five minutes.  Oh, yay…  Wow, you look…  Well, I’ve got a girl in here.  Well, we’re-we’re hanging out in here!  Well, I suppose I’d have to say you!! But, what if we’re watching a movie in here?  Well, Ross and Emily aren’t gonna use it.  Oh Mon-Mon-Mon-Mon-look, this is the honeymoon suite. The room expects sex. The room would be disappointed if it didn’t get sex. All of the other honeymoon suites would think it was a loser.  Okay!  Nope, not under here!  Well, you couldn’t have looked everywhere or else you would’ve found her!  Yeah, for about 30 minutes.  Yeah, we’re gonna go.  Yeah, it’s a very large plane.  But, we’ll stay here with you.  We have to leave for New York in an hour.  We can’t do that that’s insane. I mean ‘A’ he could wake up and ‘B’ y’know, let’s go for it.  ‘Kay!  Uhh, no.  No.  Yes.  Hey!  No we didn’t!  Yes! Good thing we have that, ‘Not in New York’ rule.  Right.  Oh. Y’know, that night meant a lot to me too, and it wasn’t because I was in a bad place or anything, it just meant a lot to me ‘cause, you’re really hot! Is that okay?  And I’m cute too.  Bye.  Hey!  Sure! Just give me a second to get all huffy and weird like you! Do you believe that who ever  No!  Our balcony? Seriously? That\\'s so funny because I told Monica we should put lights on our balcony. And she said  So are you gonna...talk to her?  You know when \"That\\'s fine\" sounds true when someone yells it and spits!  No no no. Good. So you\\'re moving on? Do you have any idea where you\\'re moving?  Dude, don\\'t rub my face in your crazy single life!  Why did I get married?!  Hey it\\'s the most eligible man in NY. How\\'s the moving on going?  Well maybe you\\'re going about this the wrong way. You know I mean think about it. Single white male, divorced three times,  What are doing? You know I can only dish it out!  Maybe she didn\\'t move on, you know...maybe that kiss was just an impulsive one-time birthday thing  Did she go out with him?  Ah! The high road...  Are you trying to get everybody divorced?  I thought I had to make the jokes!  Oh come on! Hello! Hi! My name is Chandler, here\\'s my friend Ross right here, and we were wondering you know if you\\'re up for it.  We still got it!  I don\\'t get it neither, I mean you\\'re obviously desperate, you\\'re asking women how they want to be killed  By drowning or...?!  Well...  Wow, it seems serious. What seems to be the problem, Ashley Judd?  I am sorry, moment to make fun of that, please!  It�s like a baby caterpillar chasing its mama!  Ok. First of all, this is green!  All right, I will help you out but you have to promise me you will not tell anyone what I am about to tell you.  Ok, you know how most kids get their allowance from mowing the lawn or taking out the garbage, well I earned mine  Yeah, well, I guess you don�t need my help Victor Victoria!  Oh, not with my combination of ice cubes, aloe Vera and my gentle self-loathing touch.  And done!  Thanks. You wanna see what it looks like?  Yeah, yeah, I think it looks pretty good. I was a little worried I was uncovering a birthmark right about  No problem.  Yeah.  I am sorry I am late. You�ll understand when you�ll see Joey.  Really? In front of all this people?  Oh my God!  Are those my wife�s nipples?  I gotta stop this.  You, touching yourself, out!  �Jeremiah was a bullfrog. Was a good friend of mine, never understood a single word he said, but I helped him  Y’know what? It seems like all of the sudden; so much has happened.  Phoebe is, making people.  And we just sit here. I mean if I die the only way people would even know I was here, would be by the ass print on this chair! Look, we have to do something. Okay? Something huge!  No-no, not something stupid, something huge.  Why not?! I mean it’s just, it’s just climbing! It’s just, it’s just steep!  We’re going to Everest! Okay, it would be nice to leave an ass print on Everest!  Yeah baby!  Yeah, we could do that without y’know risking our lives at all!  Yeeeeahhhh.  But I’ll tell you something. One of these days we’re get off of our buts and rent Die Hard again!  Uh-oh.  She was not good. Not good.  Uh-oh.  I didn’t know that.  See, maybe that’s the one we should’ve actually hidden.  This isn’t one of those uh, y’know \"If she doesn’t come, we-we don’t, we don’t come?\" Right? Because I already bought my ticket…  Oh, that\\'s Ross\\'s.  Come on, Ross? Remember back in college, when he fell in love with Carol and bought her that ridiculously expensive crystal duck?  I KNEW IT!!!!  Ahh, so how many cameras are actually on you?  Well, You could, but... probably just the one time.  If we do that, we gotta get Die Hard.  Oh! Look at that, time\\'s up! My turn!  It\\'s your timer.  All right, then massage me up right nice!  Ah! Ahh!! Ahh!!  It\\'s so good I don\\'t know what I\\'ve done to deserve it!  Good-bye muscles!!  I\\'m telling you, she gives the worst massages ever!! Okay, it was like she was torturing me for information. And I wanted to give it up I just—I didn\\'t know what it was!  Look, for the first time in my life I\\'m in a real relationship. Okay, I\\'m not gonna screw that up by y\\'know, telling the truth.  And you\\'re gonna make them all disappear.  Done.  Hey.  Hey!  Wow! You look just like your son Mrs. Tribbiani!  Pulling flowers out it makes the bag look a lot more masculine.  Oh my God!  And a date with a man!  I\\'m sorry but, ow-owww-owww!  Hey, is Rachel here?  Okay, but now see you\\'re crying!  What?  It\\'s okay, you don\\'t have to be the best at everything.  Okay, you give the worst massages in the world.  Okay, hear me out. Okay? You give the best bad massages. If anybody was looking for the best bad massage and they were thinking to themselves, \"Who\\'s the best of that?\" They\\'d have to go to you.  Oh, it would be you! You! Monica! And you\\'d get all the votes!  Absolutely!  Hey man, how did the audition go?  Oh my God!  Yeah umm, they\\'re called wallets.  Okay listen, just give me anything I can make two of.  Yeah! You wanna come?  Come on Chloe! Finish up with your customer first. Come on Chloe! Come on Chloe!!  Uh-oh.  Well ah, ........y\\'know.  Hey, y\\'know what, maybe we should get going. I mean what time did Chloe say we should be there?  What time is it now?  Yeah all right, so we’ll hang out.  Yes. Vividly.  Yeah. Yeah, I mean what, what would we do?  She was kidding.  She was.... But y\\'know what, just in case, maybe we should come up with a set of ground rules.  Right. Right. Well ah, y\\'know we could flip for it.  Well it you don’t know that, then I don’t want to do this with you.  And that’s the only colour that comes in.  So, what are you doing here? I thought tonight was your big anniversary dinner.  Hey, no way! Come on, this is you guys, call her and work it out.  Hey, this isn’t like swimming after you eat, pick up the phone!!  Y\\'know that whole swimming thing is a myth.  Why? What happened to him?  Actually, in Oklahoma smoking is legal in all commune areas and offices with fewer than fifteen people.  No! I just happened t�do a lot trivias about smoking in different states. For example, in Hawaii cigarettes are called Leyhallalookoos.  Uch, do you think, Monica is gonna be able smell it?  Pheebs?  No thanks, I�m good.  But, those are for you.  I messed up, it was a meeting, everybody was smoking.  �kay, look: Can we just drop this? I�m not gonna smoke again.  You forbid me?  You know, I flew a long way t see my loving wife? Is she here by the way?  Oh, would you say this was the most upset you could be?  Fine. What!?  Right, fine, I�ll do it, but no talking.  And no kissing your neck.  And lots of kissing your neck.  Look, I can�t do this. I can�t make luv to you while we�re fighting this way.  That was a celebration of life. Alright, look, I�m not gonna do this. Alright, is this really the way you want a baby to be conceived?  Mean it?  Yeah, let�s celebrate life!  Uhh. You are welcome.  What?  But you said you forgave me. It was just a couple of cigarettes�no big deal.  Leave it.  You tricked me to get me into bed?  I feel so used.  I would never lie to get someone into bed.  I suppose that Monica will have the � manipulative shrew.  You mean the lully story?  Oh yeah, that�s what she says. But maybe you�re not ovulating at all, maybe it�s just a clever ruse to get me into bed.  What�s the matter with me? Why I�m such a girl?  So you never had sex with a Kennedy, have you?  Ohh, she\\'s pretty. Pretty ahh, pretty girl, the pretty--she\\'s pretty.  I could die.  I tell people secrets. It makes them like me.  All right, I\\'m gonna do it! I\\'m gonna get shot down. Any advice?  Uh Kathy, with K or a C?  Oh-oh-hey!  Hey, come on, give me a break, I\\'m out on a limb here.  Yes-yes, I was just trying to figure out a way to uh, demonstrate how I could get my exceptionally large feet into my even bigger mouth.  Jeez, at 2:30 in the morning, I didn\\'t expect to have to fight over the remote.  Oh my God! That\\'s why I got up too!  Hey, listen, I\\'m sorry about this afternoon, y\\'know, if I would\\'ve known you guys were... I never would\\'ve...  So ah, Joey tells me you two met in acting class.  That\\'s a good thing actually, because ah, he used to have me rehearse with him.  Is it on?  Oh! It\\'s on! It\\'s on!  There we go little fella.  Well the duck can swim.  Oh yeah, me too, she\\'s so cool and pretty.  She\\'s smart and funny, y\\'know? We were up all last night talking, she said the funniest thing about--what?  No, I don\\'t.  Thank you, Ross.  All right.  All right.  Oh, I just wanted to say, \"Hey!\"  Really?!  Hey!  Ohh, umm, y\\'know what, I already ate.  Y\\'know I had a big meal on Monday, y\\'know. So that\\'s just gonna get me straight through the week.  You-you do?  You got me.  Yeah. Right.  Okay.  Ohh, she\\'s-she\\'s not really my type.  Y\\'know what I think it is? It\\'s the fishnet stockings. Y\\'know? Whenever I see a girl in fishnet stockings it reminds me of my father in fishnet stockings.  Uhh, no-no thanks.  What?  Hey, look, what do you want from me?  I am pretending.  Can I sleep on your couch?  Morning.  Yeah, like there\\'s any way I could ever do that.  Hey, you know what, here\\'s a thought. Why don\\'t you stay home from work today and just hang out with me.  I can not believe that I am going out with someone that is getting divorced. I\\'m such a grown up.  Well, maybe I won\\'t kiss you, and then you\\'ll have to stay.  Nope, not this time.  I\\'m not yanking you.  Yeah, I know. She makes me happy.  Hey!  Of!  You know, you should really go on this show. All right, listen, I got three tickets to the Rangers tonight. What\\'d ya\\' say?  No, Janice.  You know, I may be way out on a limb here, but do you, do you, have a problem with Janice?  Ooh, that girl that I hate, eww, drives me crazy, eww, eww, oh!  Well, there you go.  I want you to say that you like her!  Umm, yeah.  Girth? Why, why, why, wh-why, why, why, why would they do this?  We\\'re not gonna talk about girth are we?  Yeah, okay.  Yeah! All right! You go first.  Okay.  Princess Leia in the gold bikini.  I know!  Okay.  Okay, you know, you know when your in bed, with a woman.  And, ah, you know, your fooling around with her. And you get all these like, mental images in your brain, you know, like Elle MacPherson, or that girl at the Xerox place....  You said...  What are you guys doing together?  Really.  You still can\\'t stand her can you?  Well, you know, I appreciate you giving it a shot.  Well, I guess that\\'s something.  Okay.  Oh God!  Really?  Ok honey. that was close.  Hi honey I\\'m home!  oh it was great.  well, well, well it must be five in Tulsa because it\\'s six o clock IN NY.C!  no I\\'m not quite sure you got the right movie that\\'s all.  does what always have to be sharks.  What\\'s going on?  let ME be a part of this!  no they don\\'t  OH MY GOD! When you came in I switched the channel, I was just watching regular porn  yeah just some good old fashion girl on girl American action.  And you wonder why Ross is their favorite?  What are you doing?  It’s a dog.  It’s your parents’ anniversary and you’re going to talk about their dead pet?  Ha!  Yeah.  I don’t think the flash went off.  Somewhere there is someone with a tranquilizer gun and a huge butterfly net looking for that man.  What are you doin’?  I know, me too. Hey! Y\\'know what if we went away for a whole weekend? Y\\'know we\\'d have no interruptions and we could be naked the entire time.  Yeah, I can say that I have a conference and you can say you have a chef thing.  I\\'m not in charge of where the conference is held. Do you want people to think it\\'s a fake conference? It\\'s a real conference.  What\\'s going on?  Uh, hey!  We\\'re flipping Monica\\'s mattress.  Oh yes, somebody just said, \"Can you hear anything?\"  Condoms?  And condoms are the way to do that?  Oh, you should live with Joey, Roll-os everywhere.  Oh yes! Monica, get in here! There\\'s a high-speed car chase on!  Half a tank? We still got a lot of high-speed chasing to do!  What? Why?  Oh, I\\'m sorry, am I getting in the way of all the room switching fun?  Oh, who should I blame? The nice bell man who had to drag out luggage to 10 different rooms?  Do not speak ill of the dead.  I just want to watch a little television. What is the big deal? Geez, relax mom.  I said, \"Geez, relax Monnnnn.\"  Damn Rollos!  Hey.  Uh, no, I got to see Donald Trump waiting for an elevator.  Well, maybe it was the kind of food that tasted good at first but then made everybody vomit and have diarrhea.  Okay, fine, $300.  Yeah, just think of it as $25 per room!  Hi!  Okay, Ross is in the bathroom.  Kip, my old roommate, y\\'know we all used to hang out together.  Yes that was mine.  Yes that would have made more sense.  I just came over to drop off…nothing. So that weekend kinda sucked, huh?  So, I guess this is over.  Well, y\\'know, you and me, it had to end sometime.  Because of the weekend, we had a fight.  So, this isn\\'t over?  Really? Okay. Great!  Okay.  It happened in London.  The reason we didn\\'t tell anyone was because we didn\\'t want to make a big deal out of it.  No-no-no-no-no! You can\\'t!  Fun\\'s over!  You!  Oh, I can uh, check that for ya.  I can check that for ya.  Well… we-we do. You can only eat Tic Tacks in even numbers.  Okay, ten bucks says that we can name every item in that bag.  Yes!  Diet soda.  Orange juice.  Well, we used there’s up last night making scary faces.  All right! Ten buck! Fork it over! Cough it up! Pay the piper! Gimme it.  Fears and Pet Peeves.  His legs flail about as if independent of his body!  She has a real name.  Althea?! What are you doing?!  You\\'re shooting with Althea?!  Nice shooting!  Actually, it’s Miss Chinandolor Bong.  Unfortunately that is correct.  I majored in lightning rounds. All right, we’re gonna destroy you.  Well, I’m so confused as to what we’ve been doing so far…  Say 200?  But if we win, we get your apartment.  Dangerous Liaisons.  Fancy.  Fancy guest.  Thanks man.  You can’t just call Monica’s room.  Oh, I would never bet this apartment. It’s too nice.  Hey!  Yeah, but I bet it works.  Well believe it baby!  I knew it!  Cool, girl roommate.  Would you all stop yelling in our apartment! You are ruining moving day for us!  What?! What-what is it?!  I can’t believe we live here!  Hi, my name’s Chandler. I just moved in next door and I was wondering if you would be interested in battling me in a post-apoplectic world for control of the galaxies last remaining energy source?  So, is Janine around?  Can I check out what she did to my room?  No! Ok, this is not good. You are a guy. Ok? This is a guys place. If you let this go, you’re going to be sitting around with your fingers soaking in stuff.  Yes talk to her. Be a man.  Defend yourself.  Hey, how was your breakfast with Hillary?  Ohh, yeah.  That’s weird. I don’t think my boss likes me either.  Yeah let’s head off to work.  You know…Oh My God.  Yeah, what was wrong with your old…human teeth.  What???  I am proud of all my friends today.  Hi, I’m Chandler. Your live-in boy  Yes, God forbid we throw out old underwear. You-you know what? I’m going to go over to Joey’s.  Yes, but I feel like I’ve really gotten in touch with my feminine side enough today. You know. In fact I think we’re two sachets away from becoming a lesbian couple.  Nah, Nah, it’s okay. I feel like I need to be in guy place. You know, do kind of like a man thing.  You know when guys hang out they don’t just drink some beer and hammer up drywall?  No thanks, Josephine.  Hey Ross, I was wondering if… Oh my God!! Where are all the men???  Monica, could you excuse us for a second? I need to talk to the girl with the flowers.  What is the matter with you ?!?  You’re turning into a women.  Now I’ve upset you? What did I say?  Yeah.  Twenty percent is a pretty generous tip Joe.  I see where you’re goin’!  Hey-hey, is Monica here?  Okay, look I need your help, I don’t know what to get her for Valentine’s Day.  Yeah, I thought so to until I paper mached one of my eyes shut.  Nothing!  Well, have you guys made anything that maybe I can take credit for?  Hey! Honey, can I ask you a question about the Valentine’s Day gifts?  Do we have to make the entire thing?  Of course, of course not. I just have to uh, go over to the place where I-I made it and pick-pick it up.  Hey.  What?!  I can’t figure out what to make Monica.  I’m going crazy! Okay? Do you have any thing around here that looks homemade?  Yeah, I guess I could use that. I could say that your love sends me to the moon.  Wait a minute, I can’t give this to her.  Because it says \"Captain Ross\" on the side and \"I hate Monica\" on the bottom.  Hey! Hi! You uh, ready to exchange gifts?  Okay, come here! Come here.  Now, it’s not wrapped because I just, just finished it.  But I made you a tape of what I think are all romantic songs.  Okay!  Yeah!  It’s a sock bunny.  Not really.  I see. Y’know umm, Phoebe makes sock bunnies.  Oh, it’s okay. I don’t…  You are totally and completely 100% forgiven.  You have done enough!  No you don’t—get it in black, not brown.  Oop!  Well, it’s like that old saying, have some sex, eat some cake.  Who the hell is Carl?!  Y’know sometimes the good ideas are just right in front of you, aren’t they?  Oh my good God.  Look, you have done enough! Okay? You have to stop this now.  Oh, the mixed tape.  I am so, so, so, so sorry!  Come on Monica, it’s our Valentine’s Day. Please? Please-please, please?  So, are we going in there?  No, see, I\\'m trying this new screening thing. You know, I figure if I\\'m always answering the phone, people\\'ll think I don\\'t have a life. My god, Rodrigo never gets pinned.  What?  Bob here.  I\\'m back.  Um, absolutely. Uh, how \\'bout tomorrow afternoon? Do you know uh, Central Perk in the Village, say, five-ish?  Ok. Ok. Having a phone has finally paid off.  I\\'m hoping that when Bob doesn\\'t show up, she will seek comfort in the open arms of the wry stranger at the next table.  Ok, pure evil, horny and alone. I\\'ve done this.  Ok, while Ross is on the phone, everybody owes me 62 bucks for his birthday.  Hey, come on, we got the gift, the concert, and the cake.  Look guys, I know it\\'s a little steep.  But it\\'s Ross.  I\\'ll see you guys later, I gotta go...do a thing.  You know, I think I might just.  Oh, come on. I can never get a girl like that with conventional methods.  We don\\'t know Bob, ok? We know me. We like me. Please let me be happy.  All right.  Hi.  Listen, I have to, uh, um, I have to, I have to confess something.  Whoever stood you up is a jerk.  I don\\'t know. I just had this weird sense. You know, but that\\'s me. I\\'m weird and sensitive. Tissue?  No, you keep the pack. I\\'m all cried out today.  Oh, see, I had to tell her that my number was your number, because I couldn\\'t tell her that my number was my number because she thinks that my number is Bob\\'s number.  I will have the uh, Cajun catfish.  Yes, how \\'bout a verse of Killing Me Softly. You\\'re gonna sneeze on my fish, aren\\'t you?  Whoa, whoa, prom night flashback.  You can tell us.  We can talk about that.  So um, how come you guys haven\\'t talked about this before?  No, the thing was, we were gonna go see Hootie and the Blowfish.  Together.  So, the ebola virus. That\\'s gotta suck, huh?  Gee, Monica, what\\'s in the bag?  By the way, this didn\\'t seem so dorky in the hall.  Why, it\\'s six tickets to Hootie and the Blowfish! The Blowfish!  If you guys feel this big, maybe that\\'s not our fault. Maybe that\\'s just how you feel.  Why did you look at me when you said that?  Fine.  Yeah?  Yeah. Just let me grab my jacket and tell you I had sex today.  Wow, it sounds even cooler when somebody else says it. I was awesome, ok? She was biting her lip to stop from screaming.  Now I know it\\'s been awhile, but I took it as a good sign.  I had sex today. I never have to answer that phone again.  Bob here.  So, uh, you met someone, huh?  So, uh, how was he?  Eh?  Well, that makes me feel so good.  Well, maybe he had some kind of uh, new, cool style, that you\\'re not familiar with. And uh maybe you have to get used to it.  So, let\\'s go.  Yeah, I mean, it would be rude to them for us to leave now.  I can\\'t believe the guys missed this.  Chandler.  Yeah, we really missed you guys.  Yes, apparently Stevie and the band are like this.  I don\\'t know what to say. I\\'m sorry that we make more money than you. But we\\'re not gonna feel guilty about it. We work really hard for it.  I\\'m just saying that sometimes we like to do stuff that costs a little more.  Yes.  No.  Oh, I can\\'t believe my sperm have low motility because, let me tell you, when I was growing up they sure seem to be in a hurry to get places!!  Hi.  Oh, DAMN IT!  I think I can safely say that we all have family issues, work stuff and/or are sick.  But you come first!  Not as much fun as last time. Apparently you only get porn if you\\'re giving a sperm sample.  Well... there\\'s surrogacy, but Monica has dreamt her whole life of carrying a child, she has felt that watching a surrogate would be... too hard for her.  Yeah.  Aside from adoption the only other choice is insemination, so... we\\'re talking about sperm donors.  I wish there was an easier way for us to have a child but I don\\'t think there is one.  Hey! Look I brought a friend for dinner, this is Zack, from work!  So, how would you like to have a baby that\\'s half yours and half his!  Well, we\\'re talking about sperm donors and Zack may be the guy! I mean, look, he\\'s intelligent, he\\'s healthy, he\\'s athletic, I mean, he is \"spermtastic\"!  No, I invited him to dinner so you could get a chance to get to know him! I mean, if we go through a sperm bank you never meet the guy, get to check him out.  I\\'m telling you, he\\'s great! I mean, even if my sperm worked fine, I\\'d think he\\'d be the way to go!  Ok!  So what do you think? I want that guys genes for my kid! Those eyes, those cheeckbones!  You don\\'t like him.  Alright! Just follow my lead!  Oh! Thanks, I\\'m crazy about our place. Hey! speaking of crazy... do you have a history of mental illness in the family?  I noticed you were enjoying that Ravioli with a beautiful set of teeth. Did you have braces as a child?  You sure you don\\'t wanna stick around a little longer?  Are you just tired now or are you always tired, \\'cause that could be a sign of clinical depression.  Ok.  I think we\\'ve found our sperm!  Yeah, you think so, well? Should I ask him?  Why not, just because his great-grandmother was obese, our kids are gonna get that from you anyway!  Yeah, he\\'s better!  Really? Are you sure?  So you know this leaves us with...  How do you feel about that?  Me too. I wanna find a baby that needs a home and I wanna raise it with you. And I wanna mess it up in our own specific way.  We are gonna be great parents.  Wait, if we\\'re lucky, and we\\'re really really really quiet, we may be able to hear the sound of a condom breaking!  Hey, Zack!  Look, I just wanted to apologize for last night. I got the feeling we made you a little uncomfortable.  Really?  My wife and I have some boundary issues, you know, sometimes we ask inappropriate questions. We\\'re working on it.  You wouldn\\'t know if Jeanette\\'s planning on keeping her baby, would ya?  What’s the matter honey?  Oh, I got some thoughts on that.  What in God’s name is that?!  Why are you napping over here instead of over at your place?  Now, do I get to look at this book or is it just for people who are actually involved in the wedding?  Okay.  Centerpieces!  Uh-huh!  Oh yeah, I should probably call them.  Oh, I don’t think I ever heard that story.  What a sweet story.  Honey, it’s gonna be okay.  Look, it really is gonna be okay. The important thing is that we love each other and that we’re gonna get married.  Well, I have some.  Well, you’re not suggesting that we spend all of the money on the wedding?  Well, come on, I’ve been saving this money for six years and I kinda had some of it earmarked for the future, not just for a party.  No, I realize that honey, but I’m not gonna spend all of the money on one party.  Look, I understand, but I have to put my foot down. Okay? The answer is no.  Yes, I am!  Hey.  Ehh.  Look, I thought about it too, and I’m sorry. I think we should spend all of the money on the wedding.  Yeah, I’m putting my foot down. Yeah look, when I proposed I told you that I would do anything to make you happy, and if having the perfect wedding makes you happy then, then that’s what we’re gonna do.  Eh, forget about the future and stuff! So we only have two kids, y’know? We’ll pick our favorite and that one will get to go to college.  Yeah.  Uh, four, a boy, twin girls and another boy.  Well, stuff like where’d we live, y’know? Like a small place outside the city, where our kids could learn to ride their bikes and stuff. Y’know, we could have a cat that had a bell on it’s collar and we could hear it every time it ran through the little kitty door. Of course, we’d have an apartment over the garage where Joey could grow old.  Sure you do.  You sure?  I love you so much.  Oh yeah, totally!'}"
